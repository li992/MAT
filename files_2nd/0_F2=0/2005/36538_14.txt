19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of the groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not employed for speculative purposes.
The groups risk management policies and practices are as follows: a Debt Management The group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational exibility.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity pro le and to maintain short term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be nanced initially using short term funds before being re nanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate.
Short term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with whom Hammerson maintains strong working relationships.
Medium and long term debt mainly comprises the groups xed rate unsecured bonds.
45 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED b Interest Rate Management Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the groups debt, allowing changes from xed to oating rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the groups ratio of xed to oating rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate pro le against these guidelines.
The Company has interest rate swaps of 176.4 million maturing within the next five years.
Under these swaps the Company receives interest at a xed rate of 6.0% and pays interest at variable rates linked to LIBOR.
At 31 December 2005, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of 7.3 million 2004: 5.7 million asset.
The group does not hedge account its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
The fair value of such swaps at 1 January 2005 was adjusted against the opening balance of retained earnings at that date, as described in note 27. c Foreign Currency Management The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by nancing the cost of acquiring euro denominated assets with euro borrowings.
The group borrows in euros and uses currency swaps to match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities.
To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries in France and Germany, the group has designated both euro denominated bonds and currency swaps as hedges.
The carrying amount of the bonds at 31 December 2005 was 548.0 million 2004: 563.7 million and their fair value was 578.9 million 2004: 610.1 million.
At 31 December 2005 the group had currency swaps of 68.7 million, being 100 million sold forward against sterling for value on 31 January 2006, at a rate of 1 1.455.
At 31 December 2004 the group had currency swaps of 315.6 million, being 446.0 million sold forward against sterling for value on 4 January 2005, at a rate of 1 1.413.
The changes in fair value of the hedging instruments and the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items are recognised directly in equity, in the hedging and translation reserves respectively.
d Pro t and Loss Account and Balance Sheet Management The group maintains internal guidelines for interest cover and gearing.
Management monitors the groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
e Cash Management Cash levels are monitored to ensure suf cient resources are available to meet the groups operational requirements.
Short term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
f Credit Risk The groups principal financial assets are bank and cash balances, short term deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The amounts are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
The credit risk on short term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The group has no signi cant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and tenants.

Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2005, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the groups pro t before tax by approximately 7.4 million 2004: 3.6 million.
The effect of interest rate swaps has been included in this estimate.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of the euro against sterling would have increased the groups pro t before tax by approximately 0.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2005 2004: 0.1 million.
i Fair Values of Financial Instruments The fair values of borrowings together with their carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows: 2005 2004 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Current borrowings 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 Non-current borrowings 2,111.2 2,317.8 1,816.8 1,997.0 Unamortised borrowing costs 16.9 16.9 18.0 18.0 Currency swaps 0.2 0.2 Total borrowings 2,094.8 2,301.4 1,799.5 1,979.7 Interest rate swaps 7.3 7.3 5.7 The fair values of the groups long term borrowings have been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices.
The fair values of the groups outstanding interest rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash ows, using appropriate market discount rates.
Details of the groups cash and short term deposits are set out in note 16.
Their fair values and those of other financial assets and liabilities equate to their book values.
At 31 December 2005, the fair value of financial liabilities exceeded their book value by 206.6 million 2004: 180.2 million, equivalent to 72 pence per share 2004: 65 pence per share on an adjusted net asset value per share basis.
On a post tax basis, using a tax rate of 30%, the difference was equivalent to 51 pence per share 2004: 46 pence per share.

The Trustees of the Hammerson Employee Share Ownership Plan acquire the Companys own shares to award to participants in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
In 2005, the group clari ed its accounting policy in respect of this reserve, such that it now only includes the Companys investment in own shares at cost.
The difference between cost and the carrying value as previously reported, being the credit entry in respect of the IFRS 2 charge for share awards under the ESOP, has been transferred to other reserves see note 22.
This prior year adjustment has no effect on equity shareholders funds or the reported result for 2004.
The expense related to share-based employee remuneration is calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 and the terms of the Plan, and recognised in the income statement within administration expenses see note 4.
The corresponding credit is included in other reserves.
When the Companys shares are awarded to employees as part of their remuneration, the cost of the shares is transferred to other reserves.
Should this not equal the credit previously recorded against other reserves, the balance is adjusted against retained earnings.
The number of shares held at 31 December 2005 was 740,083 2004: 605,408 following awards to participants during the year of 140,325 shares 2004: 37,006.

The fair values of investment properties and deferred tax liabilities were determined by the directors.
The pro t of the Villebon group between the date of acquisition and 31 December 2005 was 1.3 million.
The table above used the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.
The value of the Villebon property at 31 December 2005, at the exchange rate prevailing at that date, was 104.3 million.
In 2004 the negative goodwill of 6.2 million credited to the income statement was the discount received on the purchase by the group of 50% of West Quay Shopping Centre Limited and a further one-third interest in The Moor House Limited Partnership.
26 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES There are contingent liabilities of 12.6 million 2004: 11.9 million relating to guarantees given by the group and a further 10.1 million 2004: 6.5 million relating to claims against the group arising in the normal course of business.
Hammersons share of contingent liabilities arising within joint ventures, which is included in the gures shown above, is 6.9 million 2004: 2.8 million.
27 EXPLANATION OF THE TRANSITION TO IFRS 2005 is the first year that the group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The last financial statements presented under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004.
As IFRS comparative gures must be prepared for the year ended 31 December 2004, the date of transition to IFRS was 1 January 2004, with the exception of the adoption of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, as explained below.
The group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, which allows the deferral of the accounting and disclosure requirements of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
As such, the effective date of transition to IFRS in relation to these standards is 1 January 2005.
The effect of the change is to include the fair value of interest rate swaps in the balance sheet at fair value and to recognise changes in their fair value in the income statement.
As at 1 January 2005, retained earnings and equity shareholders funds were increased by 4.0 million, being 5.7 million representing the fair value of interest rate swaps at that time, less the related deferred tax of 1.7 million.
This restatement arose in Hammerson plc in which company the interest rate swaps were held.
Reconciliations of equity at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 and pro t for the year ended 31 December 2004 reported under UK GAAP and IFRS are shown below.
Further details of the reconciliations of equity at 31 December 2004 and pro t for the year then ended have previously been published on the Companys website, www.
53 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 27 EXPLANATION OF THE TRANSITION TO IFRS CONTINUED IFRS 1 requires an explanation of major adjustments to cash ows under IFRS.
Whilst the format of the cash ow statement is different from UK GAAP, there are no material changes to cash ows from operations, investment or nancing.

The principal reasons for the adjustments shown in the reconciliations between UK GAAP and IFRS are set out below.
a Interests in leasehold properties are accounted for as finance leases under IFRS, and the obligation to the freeholder or superior leaseholder is included within non-current liabilities, calculated as the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
Investment and development properties are valued net of this obligation, so an amount equivalent to the obligation is included in the balance sheet as a non-current asset.
An element of the rent payable is treated as interest and a part repayment of the obligation to the superior leaseholder or freeholder.
b Under IFRS unapproved dividends are not provided for.
Accordingly, the UK GAAP gures for equity shareholders funds have increased to re ect the exclusion of proposed dividends.
c The net liabilities arising from the groups fide ned bene t pension schemes are included in the balance sheet under IFRS.
d Under IFRS, deferred tax provisions are made for the tax that would potentially be payable on the sale of investment and development properties and other assets, whereas UK GAAP requires that this potential liability is disclosed as contingent tax but not provided in the balance sheet.
54 b Reconciliation between Pro t for the Year and Adjusted Earnings per Share under UK GAAP and IFRS 31 December 2004 Pro t attributable Adjusted to equity earnings shareholders per share Notes m pence UK GAAP 116.3 30.0 IFRS adjustments: Revaluation gains on investment properties f 283.7 Deferred tax g 32.0 Allocation of rent free periods h 3.1 1.1 Amortisation of lease incentives and letting costs h 1.5 0.5 Marketing costs h 1.1 0.4 Capitalised interest i 1.2 0.4 Negative goodwill j 6.2 Employee share-based remuneration 1.1 0.4 Foreign exchange k 2.7 1.0 Change in fair value of interest rate swaps l Minority interests 3.1 Other 0.8 0.3 Net IFRS adjustments 315.1 1.3 IFRS 431.4 28.7 Notes UK G AAP referred to above is that existing at 31 December 2004 and does not re ect any changes to UK GAAP extant at 31 December 2005. f IFRS requires that valuation changes on investment properties are included in the income statement.
g Deferred tax arising on valuation changes and other items is included in the IFRS income statement.
h There are a number of other adjustments which affect pro t for the year: Under UK GAAP, rent free periods are allocated over the period to the first rent review.
Under IFRS, rent free periods are allocated over the period to the first break option or, if the probability that the break option will be exercised is considered low, over the full lease term.
Under UK GAAP, other lease incentives such as cash inducements and contributions to tenant t out are either written off, capitalised, or capitalised and amortised, depending on their nature.
Under IFRS, all such costs are capitalised and amortised over the period to the first break option or, if the probability that the break option will be exercised is considered low, over the full lease term.
Letting costs are capitalised on developments and written off for investment properties under UK GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, marketing costs are capitalised for development properties and expensed as incurred for investment properties.
IFRS requires that all marketing costs be expensed as incurred.
55 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED b Reconciliation between Pro t for the Year and Adjusted Earnings per Share under UK GAAP and IFRS CONTINUED Notes continued i Under UK GAAP, where an existing investment property is redeveloped, interest is capitalised on the total cost of the property, including its value prior to redevelopment.
Under IFRS, interest is only capitalised on the new expenditure incurred, resulting in an increase in the net cost of finance and a reduction in interest capitalised.
j Negative goodwill arose on the purchase of additional interests in West Quay Shopping Centre Limited and The Moor House Limited Partnership in 2004.
Under IFRS negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
k Under IFRS the income statements of the groups foreign operations are translated at rates approximating the exchange rate on the date of each transaction.
For practical purposes this is regarded as the average exchange rate for the year.
UK GAAP allowed the year-end exchange rate to be used for the translation of both the income statement and balance sheet.
l As explained above, the fair value of interest rate swaps is included in the balance sheet with effect from 1 January 2005.
