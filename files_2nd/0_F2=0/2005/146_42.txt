The Group has in place a risk management policy that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments and other instruments to fix interest rates.
a Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risks primarily with respect to the US dollar, Euro and Norwegian krone.
The Group has entered into some forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure of its subsidiary companies.
At 31 December 2005, the longest dated contract has a maturity date in June 2006. b Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its interest bearing borrowings.
The Groups policy is to maintain a significant percentage of its borrowings at fixed interest rates.
This is, in part, achieved by using interest rate swaps to fix interest rate exposures on certain variable rate borrowings.
At 31 December 2005, 48% 2004: 62% of current and non-current bank loans were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
c Credit risk Credit risk exposure primarily relates to receivables balances.
The Group requires that appropriate credit checks are performed on potential customers before sales commence.
The Groups customers are typically well established oil companies with solid credit ratings.
No exposure above the provision for impairment of receivables is deemed necessary.
d Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions.
e Price risk The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk.
