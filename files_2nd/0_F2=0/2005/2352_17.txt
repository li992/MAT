Notes to the financial statements Bovis Homes Group PLC the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2005 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 10 March 2006.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS and its interpretations as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
These are the Groups first consolidated financial statements under IFRS and IFRS 1 has been applied.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
An explanation of how the transition to IFRSs has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group is provided in note 27.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards sets out the rules for adopting IFRS in the Groups first statutory accounts under IFRS.
It requires that the IFRS accounting policies to be applied for the first statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005 are determined and then applied retrospectively to the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
IFRS 1 contains certain optional exemptions to assist in the transition to IFRS.
The Group has elected to use the exemptions, relevant to the Group, or otherwise as follows: IAS 19 Revised : Employee benefits Under IAS 19, a company may elect to use the corridor approach for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
However, IFRS 1 offers an election to recognise the actuarial gains and losses in full at the date of transition.
The Group has applied the requirements of IAS 19 from 1 January 2004 with initial recognition of the defined benefits pension scheme deficit as at 1 January 2004 through reserves.
From 1 January 2004, actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they are incurred.
This is in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19, issued on 16 December 2004.
Deemed cost for fixed asset property Fixed asset property previously revalued to its fair value at the date of revaluation can continue to be held at that revalued amount.
This fair value becomes deemed cost under IFRS at the date of transition.
Subsequent depreciation or amortisation assumes that the property had initially been recognised at a cost equal to the deemed cost.
The Group has decided to use this treatment in accounting for its fixed asset property.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 26.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 for the purposes of the transition to IFRSs.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the Company and the Group where relevant.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.

Accounting policies Revenue Revenue is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser.
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts.
Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties and land is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable on legal completion of the sale transaction.
Revenue does not include the value of the onward legal completion of properties accepted in part exchange against a new property.
The net gain or loss arising from the legal completion of these part exchange properties is recognised in cost of sales.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expenditure.
Net financing costs Net finance costs comprise: 1 interest payable on borrowings, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method: 2 interest receivable on funds invested accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method: 3 dividend income recognised on the date the right to receive payments is established: and 4 gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Finance costs are included in the measurement of borrowings at their amortised cost to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Taxation Income tax comprises the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, and from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
Where the derivative instrument, typically an interest rate swap, is deemed an effective hedge over the exposure being hedged, the derivative instrument is treated as a cash flow hedge and hedge accounting applied.
Under a cash flow hedge, gains and losses on the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognised directly in equity.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting and any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in reserves is retained in reserves until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in reserves is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost as deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain property that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, this being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Regular reviews of the carrying values of property are completed to assess any inpairment in value.
When impairment is identified, the assets recoverable amount is assessed and any shortfall is written off through the income statement.

Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment continued Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less residual value which is reassessed annually of assets over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation is charged on property in respect of the value of the building.
The basis of depreciation for each class of asset is as follows: Buildings straight line over 50 years Plant and machinery 33.3% reducing balance Computer equipment straight line over 3 years Office equipment 25% reducing balance The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Fixed asset investments Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, not including any general administrative overheads, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less estimated total costs of completion of the finished goods.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of the sale of the asset, is initially recorded at cost.
Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, cost differs from the nominal amount which will actually be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, no adjustment is made to the cost of the land, the difference being charged as a finance cost.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these options, and provisions made accordingly to reflect loss of value.
The impairment reviews consider the period elapsed since the date of purchase of the option given that the option contract has not been exercised at the review date.
Further, the impairment reviews consider the remaining life of the option, taking account of any concerns over whether the remaining time available will allow successful exercise of the option.
The carrying cost of the option at the date of exercise is included within the cost of land purchased as a result of the option exercise.
Investments in land without the benefit of planning consent, either through purchase of freehold land or non refundable deposits paid on land purchase contracts subject to residential planning consent, are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these investments, and provision made to reflect any irrecoverable element.
The impairment reviews consider the existing use value of the land and assesses the likelihood of achieving residential planning consent and the value thereof.
Ground rents are held at an estimate of cost based on a multiple of ground rent income, with a corresponding credit created against cost of sales, in the year in which the ground rent first becomes payable by the leasehold purchaser.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Own shares held by ESOP trust Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity through an own shares held reserve.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Page 43 Notes to the financial statements continued 4.
Accounting policies continued Employee benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Revised : Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit schemes, the net obligation is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such benefits measured at discounted present value, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The discount rate used to discount the benefits accrued is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised with the net obligation at that date included as a liability of the Group charged through reserves.
Post 1 January 2004, all actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2: Share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in the form of share options over shares in the parent company.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant calculated using an independent option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity.
Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products and services business segment, or in providing products and services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
As the Groups main operation is that of a housebuilder and it operates entirely within the United Kingdom, there are no separate segments, either business or geographic, to disclose.
Adopted IFRS not yet applied The following adopted IFRSs were available for early application but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements: IFRS7: Financial instruments: Disclosure applicable for years commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Amendments to IAS39: Financial Guarantee Contracts applicable for years commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
The application of IFRS 7 in the year ended 31 December 2005 would not have affected the balance sheets or income statement as the standard is concerned only with disclosure.
The Group plans to adopt the standard in 2007.

The Group does not receive a tax deduction for this difference between fair value and nominal value when it is charged to the income statement, a tax deduction being obtained at a later date when the associated land cost is charged on legal completion of the house sale.
As at 31 December 2005, 10,520,000 of finance costs had not received a tax deduction.
The Group anticipates obtaining a current tax deduction in respect of this in the future and has therefore created a deferred tax asset to reflect this future tax deduction.
Employee benefits The Group has recognised the deficit on its defined benefits pension scheme under the requirements of IAS19 Revised : Employee benefits.
This has generated a liability of 22,370,000.
In future years the Group will continue to pay contributions to fund the pension deficit and there will be further movements in the deficit through actuarial gains and losses.
On the basis that such future deficit payments in excess of current service costs will obtain a tax deduction as they are paid, a deferred tax asset of 6,711,000 was included at 31 December 2005.
This deferred tax asset will be recovered and used to normalise the tax charges during these periods when tax deductions for additional contributions are obtained.

Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Reserve for own shares held The cost of the Companys shares held by the Company and the Group is recorded as a reserve within equity.
During the year ended 31 December 2005, the Group acquired 50,000 2004: 250,000 of the Companys shares and recorded an increase in the own shares reserve of 351,000 2004: 1,351,000 as a result of this acquisition.

The dividend has not been provided for and there are no income tax consequences.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share at 31 December 2005 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 81,475,000 2004: 101,724,000 and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2005 of 118,119,910 2004: 117,196,194, calculated as follows: Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 2005 2004 000 000 Profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders 81,475 101,724 Weighted average number of ordinary shares 2005 2004 Issued ordinary shares at 1 January 118,291,142 117,740,803 Effect of own shares held 792,513 891,711 Effect of shares issued in year 621,281 347,102 Weighted average number of ordinary shares at 31 December 118,119,910 117,196,194 Bovis Homes Group PLC Page 51 Notes to the financial statements continued 17.
Earnings per share continued Diluted earnings per share The calculation of diluted earnings per share at 31 December 2005 was based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 81,691,000 2004: 102,034,000 and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2005 of 118,595,375 2004: 118,125,595.
"The diluted average number of shares is calculated in accordance with IAS 33: ""Earnings Per Share""."
The dilutive effect relates to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the period.
This dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price.
The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the period.

Share-based payments The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997.
The Remuneration Committee suspended the issuing of new share options on 5 May 2004.
In accordance with scheme rules, options are exercisable at the market price of the shares at the date of grant.
The last grant of executive share options took place on 18 March 2003.
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, options are granted on a discretionary basis relative to executives seniority within the Group.
The options can be exercised if the auditors have certified that the cumulative increase in annualised basic earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in RPI by at least 4% per annum 2% per annum for share options granted before 2001 over three consecutive financial years.
Assuming this condition is satisfied, options may, under normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
There are seven historical grants of executive share options prior to 7 November 2002 where there remain exercisable share options unexercised at 31 December 2005.
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS1 and the transitional provisions of IFRS2, the recognition and measurement principles in IFRS2 have not been applied to these grants.

Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, bank loans and overdrafts, and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
Exposure to interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business and interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Throughout the year, the Groups policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Interest rate risk Hedging The Group mitigates its exposure to changes in interest rates on a core level of borrowings through procuring interest rate swaps, denominated in sterling.
At 31 December 2005, the Group held interest rate swaps totalling 40 million 2004: 75 million designated as a hedge over 40 million 2004: 75 million of borrowings.
The principal sums, draw down dates and maturity dates match those of the floating rate borrowings over which the swaps provide the hedge.
The Group classifies these interest rate swaps, subject to the swaps remaining effective hedges, as cashflow hedges and measures them at fair value.
These amounts were recognised as derivatives measured at fair value.
Effective interest rates and repricing analysis In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they reprice.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2005, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates applying for the full year would decrease the Groups profit before tax by approximately 131,000 year ended 31 December 2004: increase of 230,000.
Interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.
Fair values There is no material difference between the carrying value of financial instruments shown in the balance sheet and their fair value.
Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Land purchased on extended payment terms When land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment.
Fair value is determined by using the effective interest method.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance costs, increasing the value of the land creditor such that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the payment required.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest flows.
Interest rate swaps At each period end, an external valuation of the fair value of each interest rate swap is obtained from the relevant swap providers.
Trade and other receivables payables Other than land creditors, the nominal value of trade receivables and payables is deemed to reflect the fair value.
This is due to the fact that transactions which give rise to these trade receivables and payables arise in the normal course of trade with industry standard payment terms.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The Group uses the effective interest rate of its bank loans to discount financial instruments.
For the year ended 31 December 2005 the interest rate used to discount was 6.1% year ended 31 December 2004: 6.6%.

Capital commitments The Group is committed to incur capital expenditure of 200,000 2004: 283,000.
This relates to plant and equipment.
Contingencies The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of bonds and other agreements entered into in the normal course of business and the Company has guaranteed the performance of certain of these agreements entered into by its subsidiary companies.
The Company had guaranteed the repayment of bank loans made to one of its subsidiaries under bilateral loan facility agreements which amounted to 55 million at 31 December 2005 31 December 2004: 75 million.
The Company has not adopted amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the financial statements for the period commencing 1 January 2006.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Land held for development and housing work in progress The Group holds inventories which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
To assess the net realisable value of land held for development and housing work in progress, the Group completes a financial appraisal of the likely revenue which will be generated when these inventories are combined as residential properties for sale and sold.
Where the financial appraisal demonstrates that the revenue will exceed the costs of the inventories and other associated costs of constructing the residential properties, the inventories are stated at cost.
Where the assessed revenue is lower, the extent to which there is a shortfall is written off through the income statement leaving the inventories stated at a recoverable value.
To the extent that the revenues which can be generated change, the net realisable value of the inventories may be different.
Based on the appraisals completed at or close to the year end, there were no net realisable value write offs necessary and management remain content that the inventory values are fully recoverable.
Part exchange properties The carrying values of part exchange properties are assessed based on external valuations completed on the properties.
These valuations are based on the prevailing market conditions in the second hand housing market and to the extent that housing market pricing levels change, the values of the part exchange properties may vary.
Part exchange property values at the end of the financial year were based on recent valuations and were based on realistic market expectations.
Financial instruments The Group mitigates its exposure to interest rates through using interest rate swaps.
These interest rate swaps are held at their fair value.
This fair value is based on the likely income or cost associated with terminating the swap at the balance sheet date.
Where interest rates are volatile, the fair value of the interest rate swaps may vary as interest rates change.
The fair value of the Groups interest rate swaps reflected the interest rate position at the balance sheet date.
Pension assumptions The Group has utilised a rate of return on assets and a discount rate having been advised by its actuary.
To the extent that such assumed rates are different from what actually transpires, the pension liability of the Group would change.

Explanation of transition to IFRS As stated in note 1, these are the Groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The accounting policies set out in note 4 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 the Groups date of transition.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with its old basis of accounting UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRSs has affected the Companys and Groups financial position and financial performance is set out in the following tables and the notes that accompany the tables.
There is no impact on the Companys or Groups cash flows.
Reconciliation from UK GAAP to IFRS for the income statement - Group Year ended 31 December 2004 Note UK GAAP Effect of IFRS transition to IFRS 000 000 000 Revenue - continuing operations 559,464 - 559,464 Cost of sales a 364,664 2,348 362,316 Gross profit 194,800 2,348 197,148 Administrative expenses b, e 45,451 174 45,625 Operating profit before financing costs 149,349 2,174 151,523 Financial income 1,228 - 1,228 Financial expenses a 5,395 2,543 7,938 Net financing costs 4,167 2,543 6,710 Profit before tax 145,182 369 144,813 Income tax expense 43,200 111 43,089 Profit for the period 101,982 258 101,724 Basic earnings per ordinary share 87.0p 0.2 p 86.8p Diluted earnings per ordinary share 86.3p 0.1p 86.4p Page 60 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.
uk Notes to the financial statements continued 27.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued The impact on deferred tax of the adjustments described below is set out in note g and the effect on retained earnings is summarised in note h. a Discounting long term land creditors IAS 39 requires that financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at their fair value.
Specific financial liabilities are required to be subsequently measured at fair value.
Other financial liabilities are required to be subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
For land purchased on extended payment terms the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment.
The difference between nominal value and initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance costs, increasing the value of the land creditor such that at the date of maturity, the land creditor equals the payment required.
On the adoption of IAS 39 the effect on the Groups balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 was to reduce net assets by 7.0 million in respect of deferred term land purchases.
These amounts are stated after reflecting any associated deferred tax asset.
During 2004, the amortisation of the difference between fair value and nominal value of extended term payments on land purchases generated a finance charge of 2.6 million whilst the reduced cost of land, now held at initial fair value, generated a reduction in cost of sales of 2.4 million.
Both the finance charge and cost of sales credit have then been adjusted to take account of deferred tax which reduces the net charge in the income statement to 0.1 million.
At 31 December 2004, the effect on the Groups balance sheet from the above adjustment is a reduction in net assets of 7.1 million in respect of deferred term land purchases, net of deferred tax.
b Pension accounting Under UK GAAP, the Group did not early adopt FRS 17: Retirement Benefits.
Under IAS 19 Revised : Employee benefits, the Group is required to recognise the net surplus or deficit in the pension scheme on its balance sheet.
The net surplus or deficit is calculated by combining the fair value of the scheme assets less the actuarial assessment of the scheme liabilities discounted to the present day using specified bond yields as the discount rate.
It is important to note that the discount rates used to value the scheme liabilities under IAS 19 may be different from those used by the scheme actuary in the triennial actuarial valuation.
After initial recognition of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme deficit on 1 January 2004 through reserves, service costs have been recognised in the income statement spread systematically over the lives of the member employees.
Finance costs have been recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses have been recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
On recognition at 1 January 2004, the Group included the deficit on the pension scheme of 19.7 million with an equivalent charge to reserves.
For 2004, the IAS 19 service cost was in line with the UK GAAP pension cost at 2.6 million.
There was an actuarial loss of 1.9 million which was charged to the statement of recognised income and expense with a corresponding increase in the pension deficit.
Against this overall increase in pension deficit of 4.5 million service cost: 2.6 million: actuarial loss: 1.9 million, the Group made contributions of 3.7 million, which included 1.1 million treated as a pension prepayment under UK GAAP which was netted against the pension deficit under IFRS.
Therefore, the pension deficit increased by a net 0.8 million to 20.5 million.
Adjustments are made for deferred tax which reduces the net charge to the statement of recognised income and expense to 1.3 million with a closing net pension deficit of 15.1 million at 31 December 2004. c Interest rate swap IAS 39 requires derivative financial instruments to be disclosed separately at fair value.
This includes interest rate swaps used to fix variable rate bank loans.
Where such fixed rate interest swaps have been selected to specifically hedge a variable interest rate loan, then the swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
Cash flow hedges are required to be accounted for at fair value with changes in the fair value of the effective portion being taken through reserves.
Any fair value movement on the ineffective portion is recognised through the income statement.
The Group has a number of interest rate swaps, each specifically used to hedge a variable interest rate loan.
The Group has recognised the fair value of each of the interest rate swaps as at the transition date of 1 January 2004 and accounted for changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges each year through the statement of recognised income and expense since the hedges are considered to be effective.
On the adoption of IAS 39 the effect on the Groups balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 was to reduce net assets by 1.5 million in respect of interest rate swaps after reflecting the associated deferred tax asset.
During 2004, the fair value of the interest rate swaps reduced from an opening liability of 2.2 million, gross of deferred tax, to a closing liability of 1.3 million, gross of deferred tax, with the 0.9 million reduction recognised through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Deferred tax has then been applied to the opening and closing liabilities plus the movement in the year.
The net credit recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense was 0.6 million.
At 31 December 2004, the effect on the Groups balance sheet was a reduction in net assets of 0.9 million in respect of interest rate swaps, net of deferred tax.
d Post balance sheet event - dividends Under IAS 10, dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be classified as a liability at the balance sheet date as the proposed dividend does not represent a present obligation under IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Under UK GAAP, the final 2003 dividend of 13.0 million, which was declared at the 5 May 2004 AGM, was accounted for as a charge to the 2003 profit and loss account and recognised as a liability in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2003.
This dividend was reversed from the income statement and balance sheet and accounted for as a distribution to shareholders in 2004.
Similarly, the 2004 final dividend of 16.0 million was not been charged to the 2004 income statement and was not a liability in the 31 December 2004 balance sheet.

Explanation of transition to IFRS continued e Share based payments Under UK GAAP, only awards under the LTIP resulted in a charge to the profit and loss account, as other share options were deemed to have an intrinsic value equal to the option price.
Under IFRS 2, for both the LTIP and share option awards, the fair value of the award is calculated and then amortised over the vesting period to the income statement.
The UK GAAP profit and loss account for 2004 included a charge of 0.75 million in respect of LTIPs awarded after 7 November 2002 which has been reversed under IFRS.
However, a charge of 0.9 million was introduced under IFRS 2 arising from options issued and a change from an intrinsic to fair value basis for calculating the cost of LTIPs.
The net result, therefore, was a charge of 0.15 million to the income statement for the year to 31 December 2004.
This charge was then adjusted for deferred tax.
The corresponding credit entries for the charges in respect of IFRS 2 are taken to equity.
At 31 December 2004, the impact of IFRS 2 accounting was to increase retained earnings by 0.1 million, thus generating a net increase in net assets of 0.1 million, this being the deferred tax asset arising from the additional charges to the income statement.
f Historical revaluation of fixed asset property The Groups fixed asset property at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 was held at deemed cost which included a revaluation of 203,000.
Under IFRS, deferred tax of 61,000 is charged to retained earnings with a corresponding deferred tax liability.

Explanation of transition to IFRS continued a Post balance sheet event - dividends Under IAS 10, dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be classified as a liability at the balance sheet date as the proposed dividend does not represent a present obligation under IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
The 2004 final dividend of 16.0 million was not charged to the 2004 income statement and was not a liability in the 31 December 2004 balance sheet.
The proposed dividends receivable from subsidiaries of 12.4m in 2003 and 15.0m in 2004, which were declared and paid in 2004 and 2005 respectively, have been reversed from the income statement and balance sheet, and accounted for as income in the year that they were paid.
