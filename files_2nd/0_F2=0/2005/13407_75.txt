Other reserves reflect unrealised gains related to the transfer of investments between subsidiaries.
The profit and loss reserve of 207m 2004: negative 104m restated arose partly as a result of a provision of 58m 2004: 214m against certain investments in subsidiaries in 2001 of which 156m was reversed in 2005.
The directors consider the value of the remaining investments in subsidiaries are considerably more than their book value and, accordingly, the provision does not impact the distributable reserves of Rexam PLC which were 265m at 31 December 2005 2004: 110m restated.
