notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies IMI plc the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and its interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board.
a Basis of accounting The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments: financial instruments held for trading: financial instruments classified as available for sale and assets and liabilities identified as hedged items.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the Group for the purposes of these consolidated financial statements.
b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
c Foreign currencies i Foreign currency transactions Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income statements of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the appropriate average rate of exchange for the year and the adjustment to year end rates is taken directly to reserves.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translating transactions in the income statement in the year are reflected in profit before taxation.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the values were determined.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
iii Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the opening net assets of foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency loans used for overseas investment and transactions executed solely for the purpose of hedging foreign currency assets exposure are taken directly to reserves.
Any differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity.
d Financial instruments and fair value hedging Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value at trade date.
Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, as follows: Fixed deposits, comprising principally funds held with banks and other financial institutions, and short term borrowings and overdrafts are classified as loans and receivables and held at amortised cost after impairment losses.
Derivatives, comprising interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and options and embedded derivatives, are classified as held for trading.
Long term loans are generally held at amortised cost.
Where the long term loan is hedged, generally by an interest rate swap, and the hedge is regarded as effective, the carrying value of the long term loan is adjusted for changes in fair value.
52 IMI plc Annual Report 2005 notes to the financial statements Changes in the fair value of financial instruments are dealt with as follows: Long term loans in formal designated hedge relationships are taken to the income statement to the extent they are effective.
For assets at fair value through profit or loss and assets held for trading, all changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
e Other hedging i Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset for example, inventory, or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
ii Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used to economically hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
iii Hedge of net investment in foreign operation Where a foreign currency liability or derivative financial instrument is in a formally designated hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign currency liability or derivative financial instrument are recognised directly in equity to the extent the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness arising from net investment hedging is recognised in the income statement.
f Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions from 1 January 2004 is recognised as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
The asset recognised is measured as the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired and associated costs.
On an ongoing basis the goodwill is measured at cost less impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Fair value adjustments are always considered to be provisional at the first balance sheet date after acquisition to allow the maximum time to elapse for management to make a reliable estimate.
Under the Groups previous accounting policies, which were consistent with UK GAAP, goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998 was deducted from reserves in the year of acquisition.
In accordance with IFRS3: Business Combinations such goodwill continues as a deduction from reserves and is not recognised in the income statement in the event of disposal of the cash-generating unit to which it relates.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 January 1998 was previously capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over a maximum 20 years.
The un-amortised goodwill under UK GAAP at 31 December 2003 became the opening goodwill under the Groups transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004. ii Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if, and only if, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
53 IMI plc Annual Report 2005 notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Amortisation of intangible assets other than goodwill Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis unless such a basis gives a significant distortion to anticipated benefit over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets.
Amortisation commences from the date the intangible asset becomes available for use.
The estimated maximum useful lives are as follows: Capitalised development costs 5 years Other intangible assets Life of the intangible asset g Property, plant and equipment Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write down the cost of assets to residual values over the period of their estimated useful lives within the following ranges: Freehold buildings 25 to 50 years Leasehold land and buildings Period of lease Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years h Leased assets Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation see above and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
The majority of leasing transactions entered into by the Group are operating leases.
i Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
j Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all direct costs of production and the appropriate proportion of production overheads.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
l Impairment The carrying values of the Groups assets other than inventories see accounting policy Inventories and deferred tax assets see accounting policy Income tax, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS and is tested annually.
54 IMI plc Annual Report 2005 notes to the financial statements i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the Groups receivables is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate inherent in the asset.
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows generated by the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairment As required by IAS36: Impairment of Assets, any impairment loss of goodwill is non-reversible.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
m Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
n Employee benefits i Defined contribution pension plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit pension plans Obligations under defined benefit plans are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
iii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at balance sheet date on high quality bonds of the appropriate currency that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
iv Equity and equity-related compensation benefits The Group operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, a SAYE Share Option Scheme and a Performance Share Plan.
For options granted on or after 7 November 2002, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense each year.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
The fair value of the options is determined based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
o Provisions Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are valued at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
p Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at their cost.
55 IMI plc Annual Report 2005 notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued q Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs, or the possible return of goods.
r Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested, assumed returns on assets less interest on liabilities on employee benefit plans and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement see accounting policy Hedging.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the asset.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date that the dividend is declared.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
s Income tax The charge for taxation is based on the profits for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes.
Full provision is made for the tax effects of these differences.
No provision is made for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit such earnings.
Similarly, no provision is made for temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries since realisation of such differences can not be controlled and is not probable in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
t Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations On initial classification as held for sale, non-current disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale are included in profit or loss, even for assets measured at fair value, as are gains and losses on subsequent re-measurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
Basis of preparation EU law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002 requires that the annual consolidated financial statements of the Group, for the year ending 31 December 2005, be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS.
However, the Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 88 to 93.
The transition date for the application of IFRS was 1 January 2004.
The comparative figures for 31 December 2004 have been restated to reflect the transition to IFRS and reconciliations of profit and equity from UK GAAP to IFRS are presented in note 29, as well as a reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004.
These are the Groups first consolidated financial statements and IFRS1: First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards has been applied.
The accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial statements under IFRS are provided in note 1.
The comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2004 are not the Companys statutory accounts for that financial year.
Those accounts, which were prepared under UK GAAP, have been reported on by the Companys auditors and delivered to the Registrar of Companies.
The report of the Auditors was unqualified and did not contain statements under S237 2 or 3 of the Companies Act 1985.
When preparing the Groups IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004, the date of transition, the following optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS accounting policies have been adopted: a Business combinations the provisions of IFRS3: Business Combinations have been applied prospectively from 1 January 2004.
As a result: goodwill recognised as an asset under UK GAAP as at 31 December 2003 has not been revised retrospectively to identify and extract intangible assets to be recognised separately from goodwill.
The carrying amount of goodwill brought forward in the opening IFRS balance sheet is that recorded under UK GAAP: and goodwill written-off directly to reserves under UK GAAP will not be taken into account in determining any gain or loss on the disposal of acquired businesses on or after 31 December 2003. b Employee benefits - the directors have elected to present actuarial gains and losses arising on defined benefit pension schemes in the consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense in accordance with IAS19 revised : Employee Benefits Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures.
56 IMI plc Annual Report 2005 notes to the financial statements In addition, the Group has chosen to restate comparative information with respect to IAS32: Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, IAS39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as allowed under IFRS1: First-time Adoption of IFRS: and applied IFRS2: Share-based Payment to share options granted on or after 7 November 2002.

Financial instruments US Dollar interest rate risk management The Group has raised US Dollar debt through the issuance of medium to long term fixed rate Loan Notes.
In order to manage its exposure to interest rates by maintaining a balanced exposure between fixed and floating rates, USD 95m of this fixed rate exposure was hedged back to floating through the use of interest rate swaps in 1999 and 2001 covering loan notes with maturities between 2009 and 2014.
The interest component of the fair value of this portion of the Loan Notes has been designated as a hedged item and has been revalued accordingly in the accounts.
The fair value of these interest rate swaps is included as an asset in the balance sheet at 4.7m 2004: 6.5m.
The hedged item is included in the value of the debt as an increase in liability of 5.2m 2004: increase 6.7m.
Net investment hedges The Group hedges its net investments in overseas operations by way of external currency loans and currency forward contracts.
The intention is to minimise the Group's exposure to gains and losses in the Shareholders' Funds resulting from retranslation of currency assets and liabilities at balance sheet dates.
However, any ineffectiveness arising from net investment hedging is recognised in the income statement.

All cash surpluses are invested for short periods and can be considered as floating rate investments.
Short term trade debtors and creditors have been excluded from the above two analyses.
There are no other material non-interest bearing financial assets or liabilities.

Employee benefits continued Share-based payments Under IFRS2: Share-based Payments, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense each year.
The Group operates the following share-based payment schemes: SAYE savings-related share option scheme.
This scheme is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20% below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in the business.
SAYE options are exercisable within 6 months of the exercise date and otherwise expire.
This scheme is open to the executive directors and selected senior managers within the Group.
Executive share options expire if not exercised or lapsed within the periods shown below.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP performance shares.
These are open to the executive directors and selected senior managers within the Group.
50% of these LTIP shares vest subject to EPS growth, based on internal financial performance conditions.
Hence, for purposes of IFRS2, the fair value of the shares does not include any performance related discount.
The LTIP uses TSR total shareholder return as a performance condition for the other 50% of shares granted.
As TSR is a market based performance condition, the accounting treatment differs from that for shares subject to internal performance conditions.
This means that the TSR performance condition must be incorporated into the calculation of the fair value, that is, there is a TSR-related discount in calculating the fair value.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP matching shares.
The LTIP allows cash awards to executive directors and selected senior managers within the Group subject to certain performance conditions.
At the end of the performance period, the net of tax value of any LTIP payments must normally be invested in market purchases of the Companys ordinary shares pursuant to a deferred share plan.
Such share purchases are to be made through an employee trust and held for a further three year period.
After that period, matching shares are awarded of one additional share for every four with no further performance conditions.
The terms and conditions of the grants are as follows, whereby all options are settled by physical delivery of shares: Analysis of options granted Employee SAYE options Executive options Long term 1 incentive plan Weighted Weighted Number average Normal Number average Normal Number Normal of options option exercisable of options option exercisable of awards exercisable Date of grant thousand price date thousand price date thousand date 2003 976 201p2006-2010 2,258 257p 2006-2013 - 2004 801 289p 2007-2009 2,119 358p 2007-2014 - 2005 463 380p2008-2010 484 421p 2008-2015 706 2012 2,240 4,861 706 1 The long-term incentive plan was granted at an option price of nil.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The assumptions used for grants in 2005 included a dividend yield of 3.5% 2004: 4%, 2003: 4%, expected share price volatility of 34% 2004: 36%, 2003: 37%, a weighted average expected life of 4.6 years 2004: 4.8 years, 2003: 4.8 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% 2004: 4.4%, 2003: 4.4%.
The expected volatility is wholly based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The total expenses recognised for the period arising from share-based payments are as follows: 2005 2004 m m Equity settled share based payment expense and total carrying amount of liabilities 2.0 1.4 77 IMI plc Annual Report 2005 notes to the financial statements 21.
