Principal accounting policies a Accounting convention These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRIC interpretations that, under European Regulations, are effective or available for early adoption at the Groups first reporting date under IFRS, 31 December 2005, and with those parts of the Companies Act, 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available for sale investments, financial assets and liabilities held at fair value.
A summary of the more important group accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
Where comparative figures have been prepared under UK GAAP, the applicable accounting policy has been disclosed in the relevant note.
Reconciliations from UK GAAP to IFRS are contained in notes 43 to 46.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
b Basis of consolidation The financial information of the Group incorporates the assets, liabilities, and results of Northern Rock plc and its subsidiary undertakings including Special Purpose Entities.
Entities are regarded as subsidiaries where the Group has the power to govern financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from their activities.
Inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the purchase of subsidiaries which are held at cost.
c Interest income and expense Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement for all instruments measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability, and allocates the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument for example prepayment options but does not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all amounts received or paid by the Group that are an integral part of the overall return, direct incremental transaction costs related to the acquisition or issue of a financial instrument and all other premiums and discounts.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
d Fees and commissions Where they are not included in the effective interest calculation, fees and commissions are generally recognised on an accruals basis when the service has been provided.
Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down are deferred together with related incremental direct costs and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan.
Insurance commissions are recognised in the period in which they are earned.
e Financial instruments Financial assets can be classified in the following categories: loans and receivables, available for sale, held to maturity or financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.
Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition.
The Group measures all of its financial liabilities at amortised cost, other than those instruments which have been designated as part of a hedging relationship see below.
All regular way trades are accounted for on a trade date basis.
i Loans and receivables and financial liabilities at amortised cost The Groups loans and advances to customers are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, whose recoverability is based solely on the credit risk of the customer and where the Group has no intention of trading the loan.
Both loans and receivables and financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs.
Subsequent recognition is at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
ii Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets, principally but not exclusively investment securities intended to be held for an indefinite period of time which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
They are initially measured at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value, with changes in fair value being recognised in equity except for impairment losses and translation differences, which are recognised in the income statement.
Upon derecognition of the asset, or where there is objective evidence that the investment security is impaired, the cumulative gains and losses recognised in equity are removed from equity and recycled to the income statement.
iii Held to maturity financial assets Held to maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that the Group has the ability and intention to hold to maturity.
Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
iv Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset is classified in this category if it is so designated by management on initial recognition.
Derivatives are held at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as cash flow hedges.
The assets are initially measured at fair value, with transaction costs taken directly to the income statement.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value, with changes in fair value included directly in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices.
If the market for a financial asset is not active and for unlisted securities, the Group establishes fair value using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
f Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
g Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group undertakes transactions in derivative financial instruments, which include cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps, equity swaps, interest rate caps, forward rate agreements, options, foreign exchange contracts and similar instruments, for non-trading purposes.
The Groups derivative activities are entered into for the purpose of matching or eliminating risk from potential movements in interest and foreign exchange rates inherent in the Groups assets, liabilities and positions.
All derivative transactions are for economic hedging purposes and so it is therefore decided at the 59 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 1.
Principal accounting policies continued outset which position the derivative will be hedging.
Derivatives are reviewed regularly for their effectiveness as hedges and corrective action taken, if appropriate.
Derivatives are measured initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value.
Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets and where these are not available from valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models.
Where derivatives are not designated as part of a hedging relationship, changes in fair value are recorded in the income statement.
Where derivatives are designated within hedging relationships, the treatment of the fair value changes depends on the nature of the hedging relationship as explained below.
Hedge accounting is used for derivatives designated in this way provided certain criteria are met.
The Group documents at inception of the hedge relationship the link between the hedging instrument and the hedged item as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis of whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
i Cash flow hedges A cash flow hedge is used to hedge exposures to variability in cash flows, such as variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The effective portion of changes in the derivative fair value is recognised in equity, and recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit and loss.
The fair value gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Fair value hedges A fair value hedge is used to hedge exposures to variability in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, such as fixed rate loans.
Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity.
If derivatives are not designated as hedges then changes in fair values are recognised immediately in the income statement.
iii Embedded derivatives Certain derivatives are embedded within other non-derivative host instruments to create a hybrid instrument.
Where the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risk of the host instrument, and where the hybrid instrument is not measured at fair value, the Group separates the embedded derivative from the host instrument and measures it at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
h Sale and repurchase agreements Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements repos are reclassified in the financial statements as assets pledged when the transferee has the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge the collateral: the counterparty liability is included in amounts due to other banks, deposits from banks, other deposits or deposits due to customers, as appropriate.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell, reverse repos, are recorded as loans and advances to banks or customers as appropriate.
The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities lent to counterparties are also retained in the financial statements.
Securities borrowed are not recognised in the financial statements, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability.
i Impairment losses The Group assesses its financial assets or groups of financial assets for objective evidence of impairment at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised if, and only if, there is a loss event or events that has occurred after initial recognition and before the balance sheet date and has a reliably measurable impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets or groups of financial assets.
i Assets held at amortised cost The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
Objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired includes observable data that comes to the attention of the Group about the following loss events: a significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor: b a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments: c the lender, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulty, granting to the borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise consider: d it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation: e the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties: or f observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a portfolio of assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the portfolio, including: i. adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the portfolio: ii.
national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the portfolio.
If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an impairment allowance and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
In future periods the unwind of the discount is recognised within interest income.
When a loan is uncollectible, it is written off against the related provision for loan impairment.
Such loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of the provision for loan impairment in the income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised such as an improvement in the customers credit rating, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the impairment allowance.
The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
60 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 1.
Principal accounting policies continued ii Available for sale financial assets For available for sale financial assets, the Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset, or group of financial assets are impaired.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows.
The rate used to discount the cash flows is the original effective rate on the available for sale financial asset.
The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
This includes cumulative gains and losses previously recognised in equity which are recycled from equity to the income statement.
j Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Derecognition is the point at which the Group removes an asset or liability from its balance sheet.
The Groups policy is to derecognise financial assets only when the contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires.
The Group also derecognises financial assets that it transfers to another party provided the transfer of the asset also transfers the right to receive the cash flows of the financial asset.
Where the transfer does not result in the Group transferring the right to receive the cash flows of the financial assets, but it does result in the Group assuming a corresponding obligation to pay the cash flows to another recipient, the financial assets are also accordingly derecognised.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
k Securitisation transactions Certain Group companies have issued debt securities in order to finance specific loans and advances to customers.
Both the debt securities in issue and the loans and advances to customers remain on the Group balance sheet within the appropriate balance sheet headings unless: i a fully proportional share of all or of specifically identified cash flows have been transferred to the holders of the debt securities, in which case that proportion of the assets are derecognised: ii substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the assets have been transferred, in which case the assets are fully derecognised: or iii if a significant proportion of the risks and rewards have been transferred, the assets are recognised only to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement.
All transactions previously recognised under UK GAAP on the basis of linked presentation have been recognised by the separate presentation of the gross assets and the related funding.
l Debt and equity securities in issue Issued securities are classified as liabilities where the contractual arrangements result in the Group having an obligation to deliver either cash or another financial asset to the security holder, or to exchange financial instruments under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group.
Issued securities are classified as equity where they meet the definition of equity and confer a residual interest in the Groups assets on the holder of the securities.
Financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate see interest income and expense.
Equity instruments are initially recognised at net proceeds, after deducting transaction costs and any related income tax.
Appropriations to holders of equity securities are deducted from equity, net of any related income tax, as they become irrevocably due to the holders of the securities.
m Foreign currency translation The Groups financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent company.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the restatement and settlement of such transactions are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Non-monetary items measured at amortised cost and denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate at the date of valuation.
Where these are held at fair value through profit and loss, exchange differences are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Where they are held as available for sale, exchange differences are reported directly in equity.
n Share-based payments Share-based payments are accounted for on a fair value basis.
The Group measures the fair value of the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the fair value of the Save-As-You-Earn scheme and all other share based payment schemes using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value is recognised in the income statement over the relevant vesting period and adjusted for forfeitures, with the number of shares expected to be forfeited estimated at each balance sheet date prior to the vesting date.
The impact of any revisions to estimates is reflected in the income statement, with the corresponding adjustment recognised in equity.
The only exception is where the share-based payment has vesting outcomes attached to market based performance conditions such as in the case of the LTIPs.
Under these circumstances, the Monte Carlo simulation model takes into account these market based performance conditions which effectively estimate the number of shares expected to vest.
No subsequent adjustment is then made to the fair value charge for shares that do not vest in the event that these performance conditions are not met.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the Group has only applied the requirements of the standard to equity settled share-based payments granted after 7 November 2002. o Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies, which is represented by the excess of fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, is capitalised and shown as an asset in the balance sheet.
It is reviewed for impairment annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amount, having been tested for impairment at 31 December 2003.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to the introduction of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets in 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
ii Computer software Costs incurred in acquiring and developing computer software for internal use are capitalised as intangible assets where the software leads to the creation of an identifiable non-monetary asset and it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group from its use for a period of over one year.
The software is classified as an intangible asset where it is not an integral part of the related hardware and amortised over its estimated useful life which is generally 3 to 5 years.
Costs associated with maintaining software are expensed as they are incurred.
p Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cashflow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition, including cash and non-restricted balances with central banks.
This differs from UK GAAP, where only cash and balances available on demand were regarded as cash.
61 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 1.
Principal accounting policies continued q Taxation Income tax payable on taxable profits current tax is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise.
Income tax recoverable on tax allowances is recognised as an asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offset against current or future taxable profits.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred and current tax assets and liabilities are only offset when they arise in the same reporting tax group and where there is both a legal right of offset and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
r Pensions and employee benefits The Company operates the Northern Rock Pension Scheme the Scheme to provide retirement benefits for staff.
Staff who joined the Scheme before 1 July 1999 participate in the funded, contracted out, defined benefit section of the scheme unless they opt out.
Other staff, including those employed at 1 July 1999 but not members of the defined benefit section of the Scheme at that date, together with staff employed from 1 July 1999, participate in the defined contribution section of the scheme unless they opt out.
The assets of both sections of the Scheme are held in a trustee-administered fund separate from the assets of Northern Rock plc.
A full actuarial valuation of the Groups defined benefit section of the scheme is undertaken every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years: these valuations are updated to 31 December each year by qualified independent actuaries.
For the purpose of these annual updates, scheme assets are included at their fair value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method.
Liabilities in the defined benefit section of the scheme are discounted using rates equivalent to the market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The resulting net surplus or deficit is included in the Groups balance sheet.
Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme.
The Groups income statement includes the current service cost of providing pension benefits, the expected return on the schemes assets, net of administration costs, and the interest cost on the schemes liabilities.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the changes to the Scheme are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the average vesting period.
For defined contribution plans, the Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
s Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment, as appropriate.
Additions and subsequent expenditure are included in the assets carrying value or are recognised as a separate asset only when they improve the expected future economic benefits to be derived from the asset.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is provided using the straight line method to allocate costs less residual values over estimated useful lives, as follows: Freehold property 100 years Leasehold property Unexpired period of the lease Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings plant 30 years furniture 10 years other 5 years Computer equipment PCs 3 years other 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Where the cost of freehold land can be identified separately from buildings, the land value is not depreciated.
Fixed assets are subject to impairment testing, if deemed appropriate.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until they have been completed and transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment.
The costs of financing assets in the course of construction are not included in the costs of the assets.
t Leases Operating lease payments are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis unless a different systematic basis is more appropriate.
Where an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor in compensation is charged to the income statement in the period in which termination is made.
u Share capital i Share issue costs Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
ii Dividends on ordinary shares Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders or paid.
iii Treasury shares Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from total shareholders equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders equity.
v Transition to IFRS The Groups financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2005 are the first annual financial statements that comply with IFRS.
Northern Rock plcs transition date is 1 January 2004.
The Group prepared its opening IFRS balance sheet at that date.
The Groups IFRS adoption date is 1 January 2005.
In preparing these financial statements in accordance with IFRS 1, the Group has applied the following optional exemptions and mandatory exceptions from full retrospective application of IFRS.
62 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 1.
Principal accounting policies continued Applicable optional exemptions from full retrospective application elected by the Group i Business combinations Northern Rock has applied the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1.
It has not restated business combinations that took place prior to the 1 January 2004 transition date.
ii Fair value as deemed cost Northern Rock has elected to measure certain items of property, plant and equipment at fair values as at 1 January 2004.
The application of this exemption is detailed in note 44h.
iii Employee benefits Northern Rock has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses on its final salary pension scheme at 1 January 2004, and to apply the exemption under IFRS 1 paragraph 20A from providing four years comparative amounts in respect of disclosures of the history of experience gains and losses.
iv Exemption from restatement of comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39 Northern Rock has elected to apply this exemption, with the exception in regards to the recognition of previously derecognised assets and liabilities of securitisation vehicles and inactive retail accounts in accordance with IFRS 1 paragraph 27A.
It has applied previous UK GAAP rules to derivatives, financial assets and financial liabilities and to hedging relationships for the 2004 comparative information.
The adjustments required for differences between UK GAAP and IAS 32 and IAS 39 are determined and recognised at 1 January 2005.
The adjustments are detailed in note 46. v Designation of financial instruments Northern Rock reclassified various securities as available for sale investments.
The adjustments relating to IAS 32 and IAS 39 at the opening balance sheet date of 1 January 2005, the IAS 32 39 transition date, are detailed in note 46. vi Share based transactions Northern Rock has elected to apply the share based payment exemption.
It applies IFRS 2 from 1 January 2004 to those share based payment schemes that were granted after 7 November 2002 but that have not vested by 1 January 2005. vii Recognition of financial assets and liabilities Northern Rock has applied the exemption in IFRS 1 paragraph 27A to financial assets and liabilities of securitisation vehicles and to inactive retail accounts previously derecognised.
All such balances previously derecognised under UK GAAP are recognised on the balance sheet at transition date.
Applicable mandatory exceptions from full retrospective application followed by the Group i Hedge accounting Management has applied the hedge accounting exception from 1 January 2005 only if the hedge relationship meets all the hedge accounting criteria under IAS 39.
The application of this exception at the opening balance sheet date of 1 January 2005 is detailed in note 46. w Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are relevant and mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006 or later periods but which the Group has not adopted early, as follows: i IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and a complementary amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures effective 1 January 2007.
IFRS 7 amends disclosures relating to financial instruments and requires the disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information relating to exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified disclosures about credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
It replaces IAS 30, Disclosures in the Financial Statements of Banks and Similar Financial Institutions, and disclosure requirements in IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.
The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures about the level of an entitys capital, and how it manages it.
Critical accounting estimates a Impairment losses on loans and advances Individual impairment losses on loans and advances are calculated based on an individual valuation of the underlying asset.
Collective impairment losses on loans and advances are calculated using a statistical model.
The key assumptions used in the model are the probability of any account going into default in the next twelve months, the loss incurred in the event of possession or write off, the roll rates of borrowers moving from lower levels of arrears to serious arrears and possession or write off, and the time period from the date of the event causing the loss to the date of realisation of the property or write off.
The probability of accounts going into default is based on application and behavioural scorecards, which are regularly recalibrated to take account of current circumstances.
These key assumptions are based on observed data from historical patterns from lending over previous years and are updated regularly based on new data as it becomes available.
In addition, management considers how appropriate past trends and patterns might be in the current economic situation and makes any adjustments that it believes to be necessary to reflect current conditions.
The accuracy of the impairment calculation would therefore be affected by unexpected changes to the economic situation, inaccuracies within the models used compared to actual outcomes and assumptions which differ from actual outcomes.
To the extent that the loss given default differs by - 10%, the impairment allowance would be an estimated 12.1m higher or 12.0m lower respectively.
b Fair value calculations Fair value is defined as the value at which assets, liabilities or positions could be closed out or sold in a transaction with a willing and knowledgeable counterparty.
For the majority of instruments carried at fair value, these are determined by reference to quoted market prices.
Where these are not available, fair value is based upon cash flow models, which use wherever possible independently sourced market parameters such as interest rate yield curves, currency rates and option volatilities.
Other factors are also considered, such as counterparty credit quality and liquidity.
Management must use judgement and estimates where not all necessary data can be externally sourced or where factors specific to Northern Rock's holdings need to be considered.
The accuracy of the fair value calculations would therefore be affected by unexpected market movements, inaccuracies within the models used compared to actual outcomes and incorrect assumptions.
For example, if management were to use a tightening in the credit spread of 10 basis points, the fair values of liabilities and derivatives would increase from the reported fair values by 83.8m.
c Average life of secured lending IAS 39 requires interest earned from mortgage lending to be measured under the effective interest method.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Management must therefore use judgement to estimate the expected life of each instrument and hence the expected cash flows relating to it.
The accuracy of the effective interest rate would therefore be affected by unexpected market movements resulting in altered customer behaviour, inaccuracies in the models used compared to actual outcomes and incorrect assumptions.
If the estimated average life of secured loans were increased or reduced by one month, the value of such loans on the balance sheet would be increased or decreased by 9.7m and 10.4m respectively.
63 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 2.
Critical accounting estimates continued d Pension benefits The present value of the pensions obligations is dependent upon an actuarial calculation which includes a number of assumptions.
These assumptions include the discount rate, which is used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash outflows that will be required to meet the pension obligation.
In determining the appropriate discount rate to use, the Group considers market yields of high quality corporate bonds denominated in sterling that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the pension liability.
Were this discount rate to reduce by 0.1% or increase by 0.1% from the current management estimate, the carrying value of the pension obligations would be an estimated 6.6m higher or 6.6m lower respectively.
Other key assumptions for pensions benefits including mortality tables are based in part upon current market conditions.
Additional information is included in note 7.
Interest and similar income 2005 2004 m m On secured advances 3,220.2 2,303.4 On other lending 337.0 323.5 On investment securities and deposits 499.5 362.5 4,056.7 2,989.4 The accounting policy under UK GAAP for revenue recognition in 2004 is set out below.
Interest income is recognised in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis, except for income on loans taken into possession which is taken to income when it is received.
Fees receivable from customers to reimburse the Group for costs incurred are taken to the profit and loss account when due.

Share based payment Summary of schemes Northern Rock grants share options to executive officers and employees under the following schemes: Employee Share Option Scheme Employee Sharesave Scheme Equity instruments other than options have been granted under the following schemes: Share Incentive Plan Long Term Incentive Plan Share Matching Scheme Deferred Share Scheme Further details of each scheme are given below.
Share Option Schemes Employee Share Option Scheme The Employee Share Option Scheme is an incentive scheme established in 1998 under which eligible employees may be granted share options.
In accordance with the scheme, options are granted at an exercise price equivalent to market price on the grant date with a vesting period of 3 years.
Upon vesting, options may be exercised up to ten years from the grant date.
An initial grant of options was made in 1998, a second grant was made in 2002 and a further grant was made in 2005.
Employee Sharesave Scheme Qualifying employees may participate in the Employee Sharesave Schemes which are HM Revenue & Customs approved Save As You Earn SAYE option schemes.
Under these schemes, employees may contribute a portion of their monthly salary, up to a specified maximum amount, and at the expiry of a fixed term have the option to use the savings to acquire shares in Northern Rock plc.
The fixed terms outlined in the schemes for option vesting are three, five and seven years.
Options can be exercised up to six months after vesting.
Employees who leave the Company prior to the options fully vesting may be able to exercise their options, for up to six months, if they meet certain specified criteria.
Options are granted to the employees at a discount from the market price.
This was 20% for the first two grants and 10% for subsequent grants.
The vesting period for the options is equivalent to the fixed terms in accordance with the schemes rules.
Four Sharesave schemes are currently in operation resulting from options offered to employees during 1997, 2000, 2003 and 2005.
Employees can save in any number of the schemes up to an overall specified maximum amount.
The following tables summarise the movement in the number of share options between those outstanding at the beginning and end of the year, together with changes in the weighted average exercise price over the same period.
The number of shares authorised for grant under each scheme was equal to the actual number of shares granted in all years presented.

Other Equity Instruments Share Incentive Plan Approved Profit Sharing Scheme The Share Incentive Plan SIP was established in 2003 and is available to all employees who have completed a minimum of six months of service.
Provided that the Group meets certain performance criteria annually as outlined in the SIP, eligible employees are granted rights to shares in Northern Rock plc for an amount not in excess of 5% of their annual salary, subject to a maximum of 3,000, free from any consideration.
The rights to shares vest immediately.
The Company subsequently purchases shares to satisfy the shares vested and transfers them to an independent trustee company.
Shares are transferred to the employees by the trustee company on the fifth anniversary of the grant date.
The SIP was introduced following changes to UK legislation regarding employee share compensation schemes.
Prior to this the Company operated an Approved Profit Sharing Scheme APSS for employees.
The qualifying conditions for and operation of APSS were the same as for SIP except that shares were transferred to the employees by the trustee company on the third anniversary of the grant date rather than the fifth anniversary.
Compensation expense relating to these schemes was 1.8m 2004 1.8m.
Long Term Incentive Plan Executive Directors and certain other senior executives are granted rights to shares under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.

Share based payment continued The fair value of shares granted during the year was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The significant inputs into the model were share prices of 7.68, 7.40 and 6.15 at the grant date in 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively, exercise price of nil, standard deviation of expected share price returns of 25.3%, 29.0% and 33.5% respectively, option life of 3 years, and the annual risk free interest rate of 4.5%, 4.6% and 3.8% respectively.
Correlation of the Companys share price movement with the comparator companies in the FTSE 100 index or FTSE 350 index as appropriate is calculated by reference to the share price of the Company compared to the individual FTSE 100 or 350 companies on a daily basis over the three year period ending on the date before the grant date for each scheme.
The volatility is based on a statistical analysis of daily share prices over the three year period ending on the date before the grant date for each scheme.
Compensation expense relating to this scheme in 2005 was 2.3m 2004 2.3m.
Share Matching Schemes The Company operates two Share Matching Schemes which entitle certain employees to use their annual bonus under the short term cash bonus scheme to purchase shares in Northern Rock plc.

Rights to these shares vest over 3 years from the grant date.
The Company has purchased or will purchase shares on behalf of the employees for the amounts allocated by them from their annual bonuses together with shares equivalent to the related rights granted and has transferred them to an independent trustee.
The shares will be transferred to the employees at the end of the vesting period.
Compensation expense relating to this scheme in 2005 was 3.1m 2004 2.4m.
Details of the rights held by Executive Directors are included within the Directors Remuneration Report on page 26.
The second scheme Share Matching Scheme 2 was introduced during 2001 and applies to other senior management.
Under the scheme, employees are entitled to use their annual bonus under the short term cash bonus scheme to purchase shares in Northern Rock plc.

These derivatives include hedges of certain foreign currency assets and wholesale funding recorded at amortised cost and certain instruments included within non shareholders funds.
They also include forward currency contracts and previously effective hedges which have been fide-designated.
The fair value movements of future cashflows excluding interest flows on such derivatives are separately identified within Net hedge ineffectiveness and other unrealised fair value gains and losses, together with the translation gains and losses on underlying instruments arising from the revaluation from foreign currency into sterling.
The deemed interest flows on such derivatives are included within interest income or expense, as appropriate.
Net hedge ineffectiveness excluding interest flows on fair value hedges represents the difference between changes in the fair value of future cashflows excluding interest flows of the hedging derivatives and the changes in the fair value of future cashflows excluding interest flows of the underlying hedged items.

The accounting policy used for derivatives under UK GAAP in 2004 is set out below: Derivatives comprise, mainly, currency and interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, foreign exchange forwards and financial futures and options.
All transactions are undertaken for hedging purposes.
Transactions are initially recorded at cost and are accounted for on an accruals basis in accordance with the item or items being hedged.
Consequently, profits and losses on the hedges are recognised on a similar accounting basis as the profits or losses on the underlying item or items being hedged.
They are therefore recognised in the financial statements as adjustments to the profit or loss of the item or items being hedged.
To the extent necessary to achieve a consistent timing of income recognition on the item or items being hedged, deferred gains or losses are included in the balance sheet under the headings accruals and deferred income and prepayments and accrued income.
Profits and losses on early termination of contracts that modify the characteristics of designated items are deferred and amortised over the remaining lives of the hedged items.
Income and expenses on hedges are recognised as adjustments to interest receivable and interest payable.
When a derivative no longer represents a hedge, because either the underlying asset, liability or position has been extinguished or derecognised, it is restated to market value.
Any profit or loss is accounted for in interest income or expense.
It is then either redesignated as a hedge of a different asset, liability or position, is disposed of, or the position is otherwise closed, and accounted for accordingly.
Where a derivative is no longer a hedge because it ceases to be effective, it is restated to market value and any profit or loss arising is deferred and amortised into interest income or expense over the remaining life of the item previously being hedged.

At 31 December 2004 the potential credit exposure after allowing for collateral received was 269.1m.
In addition to the derivatives disclosed above relating to 31 December 2004, there are a number of derivatives that have been entered into by the securitisation Special Purpose Entities see note 19.
These consist of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps all with a term of over 5 years.
The underlying principal amounts at 31 December 2004 were 1,636.1m and 14,810.2m.
Positive book values amounted to nil and 270.6m and negative book values amounted to nil and 1,368.5m.
Positive fair values were 42.7m and 275.4m and negative fair values were 0.3m and 1,367.1m.

The gains and losses do not therefore represent absolute gains or losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from on balance sheet instruments.
Securitisation The Groups results include the results and assets and liabilities of securitisation Special Purpose Entities SPEs on a line by line basis.
Under UK GAAP the SPEs were incorporated into the financial statements using linked presentation.
Following the introduction of IFRS and a change in UK companies legislation, these SPEs are now treated as legal subsidiaries and consolidated on a line by line basis.
Securitised advances are subject to non-recourse finance arrangements.
These loans have been purchased at par by the SPEs from Northern Rock plc, and have been funded through the issue of mortgage-backed bonds.
The balances of assets subject to securitisation notes in issue at 31 December 2005 are as follows: 75 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 19.

This balance is restricted in use to the repayment of the debt securities issued by the SPEs and other legal obligations.
On 15 November 2005, Northern Rock entered into a financial guarantee contract with Whinstone Limited, a special purpose entity, in respect of 423.0m of the first loss reserve funds held by the Granite securitisation entities repayable to Northern Rock only after repayment of all other liabilities.
Whinstone Limited simultaneously issued credit linked notes to the value of 423.0m which are included within debt securities in issue at year end exchange rates where issued in currencies other than sterling.
In addition to the transactions above, Northern Rock assigned a portfolio of unsecured loans valued at 749.7m to Flint Receivables Trustees Limited on 8 December 2003.
1 Limited purchased an interest amounting to 595.0m in the trust on the same date, funded by the issue of asset backed notes.
The noteholders have a proportionate interest in each balance in the portfolio, and at 31 December 2005 this interest amounted to 595.0m 2004 595.0m.
The funding giving rise to the noteholders interest is included within debt securities in issue.
Northern Rock retains substantially all the risks and rewards associated with these loans and therefore these transactions do not qualify for derecognition under IAS 39.

Debt securities under UK GAAP The information below is based on UK GAAP.
The accounting policy used for debt securities, and for equity shares and other variable yield securities see note 23 under UK GAAP in 2004 is set out below: Debt securities and equity shares securities are held with the intention of use on a continuing basis and are stated at cost, adjusted to exclude accrued interest at the date of purchase, less provision for any permanent diminution in value.
A similar adjustment for accrued interest is made on realisation.
Where the adjusted purchase price differs from the nominal value, the premium or discount is amortised or released on an effective yield basis over the period to maturity.
Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements are retained on the balance sheet where the Group retains the risks and rewards of ownership.
Funds received under such agreements are included within deposits by banks or customer accounts.
Securities purchased under a commitment to resell are treated as collateralised lending transactions where the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership, and the purchase price is included within either loans and advances to banks or loans and advances to customers.
The difference between sale and repurchase prices for such transactions is reflected in the profit and loss account over the lives of the transactions, within interest receivable or interest payable as appropriate.

83 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 33.
Tier one notes The tier one notes were issued for a value of 200m on 21 August 2002 and are undated.
They carry a coupon of 7.053% payable annually in arrears on 21 September each year.
At each payment date Northern Rock will decide whether to declare or defer the coupon.
If Northern Rock decides to defer the coupon, this can then only be satisfied upon the date on which the issue is redeemed.
No interest will accrue on any deferred coupon.
If Northern Rock defers the coupon, it may not pay a dividend on any share or pay any coupon on the reserve capital instruments, nor redeem or repurchase any of its share capital or reserve capital instruments until it next makes a coupon payment for the tier one notes.
Deferred coupons can only be satisfied through the issue of Ordinary Shares.
Northern Rock has a call option after 25 years, which it can only exercise with the consent of the Financial Services Authority.
If the issue is not called, the coupon resets to yield 1.835% above 6-month LIBOR.
The full amount of tier one notes is permitted for inclusion within Tier 1 for regulatory capital purposes.
Reserve capital instruments The reserve capital instruments were issued for a value of 200m on 21 September 2000 and are undated.
A further 100m was issued in May 2001.
They carry a coupon of 8.399% payable annually in arrears on 21 September each year.
If Northern Rock decides to declare the coupon, the holder will receive a cash payment equivalent to the coupon which, at Northern Rocks option, will be achieved either by the payment of cash directly, or by the issue of Ordinary Shares in Northern Rock which, when sold by a trustee in the market, will produce an amount equal to the cash payment.
If Northern Rock elects to defer the coupon, it may not declare or pay a dividend on any share until the deferred coupons are satisfied.
Deferred coupons and any interest accruing thereon can only be satisfied through the issue of Ordinary Shares.
Northern Rock has a call option after 15 years, which it can only exercise with the consent of the Financial Services Authority.
If the issue is not called, the coupon resets to yield 4.725% above the prevailing 5-year benchmark Gilt rate.
The maximum amount of reserve capital instruments permitted to be included in Tier 1 for regulatory capital purposes is 15% of overall Tier 1 capital, as defined by the Financial Services Authority.
Any excess is allocated to Upper Tier 2 capital.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 32, reserve capital instruments have been reclassified as non shareholders equity with effect from 1 January 2005.

Financial risk management Strategy in using financial instruments The Board has authorised the use of derivative instruments for the purpose of supporting the strategic and operational business activities of the Group and reducing the risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
All use of derivative instruments within the Group is to hedge risk exposure, and the Group takes no trading positions in derivatives.
The objective, when using any derivative instrument, is to ensure that the risk to reward profile of any transaction is optimised.
The intention is to only use derivatives to create economically effective hedges.
However, because of the specific requirements of IAS 39 to obtain hedge accounting, not all economic hedges are designated as accounting hedges, either because natural accounting offsets are expected or because obtaining hedge accounting would be especially onerous.
a Fair value hedges The Group designates a number of derivatives as fair values hedges.
In particular the Group has three approaches establishing relationships for: i Hedging the interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk of non-prepayable, foreign currency denominated fixed rate assets or liabilities on a one-for-one basis with fixed floating or floating fixed cross currency interest rate swaps.
ii Hedging of interest rate risk of a single currency portfolio of sterling, US Dollar and Euro non-prepayable fixed rate assets liabilities on a one-for-one basis with vanilla fixed floating or floating fixed interest rate swaps.
iii Hedging the interest rate risk of a portfolio of prepayable fixed rate assets with interest rate derivatives.
This solution is used to establish a macro fair value hedge for derivatives hedging fixed rate mortgages.
The Group believes this solution is the most appropriate as it is consistent with its policy for hedging fixed rate mortgages on an economic basis.
The total fair value of derivatives included within fair value hedges at 31 December 2005 was 163.3m.
b Cash flow hedges At present the Group does not designate any derivatives as cash flow hedges.
c Net investment hedges At present the Group does not designate any derivatives as net investment hedges.

Financial risk management continued Risk management Risk management is a fundamental part of Northern Rocks strategy, which focuses on profitable growth with a low risk profile.
The Groups risk management strategy is to manage risk exposures through comprehensive and integrated risk management processes within each section of the business as part of a framework of delegated responsibility and structured reporting.
The Board of Directors has full responsibility for approving and reviewing the main risks undertaken by the Group.
In order to manage and control its risks, the Group has implemented a comprehensive set of policies and procedures.
It has put in place appropriate systems to identify risk, and then to assess, measure, monitor and report those risks.
A series of policies and procedures exist to define the Groups levels of risk tolerance, containing risk limits and lines of authority and responsibility.
These form the basis for risk management structures throughout the business with clear terms of reference.
Furthermore, the Group has established strong systems of internal control that comply fully with the requirements of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the Financial Services Authority and the London Stock Exchange.
In accordance with the policies and procedures, the Board of Directors has established a Risk Committee consisting of four Non-Executive Directors and the Executive Directors.
The Risk Committee is responsible for the supervision of the Groups risk management processes.
It has delegated responsibility for the daily management and review of balance sheet risk profile and review of operational risk to Management Board ALCO, consisting of executive management from all the main business functions.
Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of business opportunities foregone, reputational damage or financial losses, resulting from inadequacies or failures in internal processes, people or systems, or from external events.
Management Board directors and senior line managers are primarily responsible for ensuring effective operational risk management exists within their areas in particular, the setting of tolerances, monitoring and reporting of operational risks.
Where appropriate, Northern Rock establishes suitable cost-effective processes to mitigate or transfer operational risk exposures.
Operational risks are controlled and managed on a decentralised basis, with responsibility and authority to mitigate these risks delegated to the relevant line management.
Northern Rocks support functions provide corporate policies, processes and reporting mechanisms as appropriate to the front line functions for the range of operational risks faced.
Credit risk Credit risk is the exposure to loss if another party fails to meet its financial obligations to the Company, including failing to perform them in a timely manner.
It arises from both on and off balance sheet items.
Within the Group Treasury function, the overall policy is to minimise credit risk through the use of operational credit limits, credit authorisation and credit control and review.
Credit limits authorised by Executive Management are established for specified counterparties.
These limits are based on a number of factors including external and internal ratings and capital of Northern Rock plc.
Group limits have been incorporated to ensure that Northern Rock plc does not exceed its exposure to either a single counterparty or group of closely-related counterparties.
Country limits have been incorporated to ensure that Northern Rock plc does not exceed its exposure in a geographical region.
Master netting agreements are in place with all derivative counterparties.
In addition most of the exposures created by derivatives are mitigated through the use of collateral agreements negotiated with derivative counterparties.
Other techniques including margining, credit breaks, compounding, termination and credit derivatives are used periodically to mitigate the credit risk associated with particular transactions or group of transactions.
Retail credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of operational limits, credit authorisation procedures, credit risk scorecards, credit control and review processes, to achieve a planned credit risk profile relative to the associated economic rewards.
Credit score systems are used as the primary basis for evaluating the risk reward profile of the retail credit risk stance as they are able to differentiate the risk of secured and unsecured loans, both at individual transaction and portfolio levels.
Behavioural scoring is used to monitor the performance of the residential secured and unsecured loan books.
The Credit director monitors credit risk limits on the residential secured and unsecured lending books.
The Credit Risk Monitoring Group monitors exposures on these books.
Maximum credit risk exposure at 31 December 2005 approximates to the carrying value for all assets apart from loans and advances to customers, where the carrying value includes an adjustment in respect of hedged interest rate risk.
The credit risk exposure in respect of these loans is therefore 163.9m lower than the carrying value.
Cash collateral held against credit risk at 31 December 2005 amounted to 274.4m.
Interest rate risk The Group offers numerous banking, mortgage and savings products with varying interest rate features and maturities which create potential interest rate risk exposures.
Interest rate risk arises as a result of timing differences on the re-pricing of assets and liabilities, unexpected changes in the slope and shape of yield curves and changes in correlation of interest rates between different financial instruments often referred to as basis risk.
In addition to interest rate risk positions managed within controlled risk limits within the Group, structural interest rate risk arises in the Group's consolidated balance sheet as a result of fixed rate, variable rate and non interest bearing assets and liabilities.
The Group closely monitors interest rate movements, the interest rate and re-pricing maturity structure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities and the level of non-interest bearing assets and liabilities.
Interest rate sensitivity refers to the relationship between interest rates and net interest income resulting from the periodic re-pricing of assets and liabilities.
Northern Rock also offers fixed rate residential mortgages and savings products on which the interest rate paid by or to the customer is fixed for an agreed period of time at the start of the contract.
Northern Rock matches the expected maturity profiles of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities through the use of derivatives.
The risk of prepayment is additionally reduced by imposing penalty charges if the customers terminate their contracts early.
The Group uses a number of measures to monitor and control interest rate risk and sensitivity.
One such measure evaluates the difference in principal value between assets and liabilities repricing in various gap periods.
Risk weights are assigned to each gap period which reflect potential losses for a given change in rates, and based on these a capital allocation is calculated for each period.
The risk is controlled through setting maximum overall capital allocations, and individual capital allocations for each gap period.
A second control used measures earnings at risk from unmatched positions in fixed rate lending.
The Group imposes a limit on the value of such earnings that may be at risk, based upon various scenarios of adverse interest rate changes.
The sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates is measured by comparing forecast net interest income over a 12 month period under two interest rate scenarios, a 1% parallel increase and decrease in all yield curves.
Forecasts are based on measuring the sensitivity of net interest income for all on-balance sheet and derivative instruments while maintaining a consistent balance sheet size and structure throughout the simulation period.
Forecasts include the effect on net interest income of those instruments which have embedded optionality.
Forecasts also include other simplifying assumptions, such as no management action in response to a change in interest rates.
An immediate hypothetical 1% parallel increase and decrease in all yield curves on 31 December 2005 would result in a decrease of 32.4m 2004 33.0m and an increase of 28.4m 2004 27.0m, respectively, in planned net interest income for the twelve months to 31 December 2006.

Financial risk management continued The following table gives an analysis of the re-pricing periods of assets and liabilities on the Group balance sheet at 31 December.
Items are allocated to time bands in the table below by reference to the earlier of the next contractual interest rate re-pricing date and the residual maturity date.
In the 2005 table the carrying amounts of derivative financial instruments are included in other assets and other liabilities under the heading non interest bearing funds.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the mismatch in the cashflows generated from current and expected assets, liabilities and derivatives.
The Board has policies to ensure that the Group is able to meet retail withdrawals, repay wholesale borrowings as they fall due and to meet current lending requirements.
This is achieved by managing a diversified portfolio of high quality liquid assets and a balanced maturity profile of liquid assets, wholesale and retail funds.
The table below analyses the Groups assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at balance sheet date to contractual maturity date.
Financial risk management continued Currency risk Currency risk arises as a result of the Group having assets, liabilities and derivative items that are denominated in currencies other than sterling as a result of normal banking activities, including wholesale funding.
In addition to raising funds through sterling money markets, capital markets and domestic retail savings market, the Group raises funds through issuing nonsterling denominated commercial paper, certificates of deposit, medium-term debt securities including securitised notes and covered bonds and retail funds.
The Groups policy is to fully mitigate any exchange rate exposures by using cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, or to match exposures with assets denominated in the same currency.
The table below gives values of assets and liabilities at sterling carrying values denominated in different currencies at the balance sheet date.

Valuation methods for calculations of fair values in this table are set out below: Cash and balances with central banks Fair value approximates to carrying value because they have minimal credit losses and are either short term in nature or re-price frequently.
Loans and advances to banks Fair value was estimated by using discounted cash flows applying either market rates where practicable or rates offered by other financial institutions for loans with similar characteristics.
The fair value of floating rate placements, fixed rate placements with less than six months to maturity and overnight deposits is their carrying amount.
Loans and advances to customers The Group provides loans of varying rates and maturities to customers.
The fair value of loans with variable interest rates is considered to approximate to carrying value.
For loans with fixed interest rates, fair value was estimated by discounting cash flows using market rates or rates normally offered by the Group.
Deposits by banks and customer accounts Fair values of deposit liabilities repayable on demand or with variable interest rates are considered to approximate to carrying value.
The fair value of fixed interest deposits with less than six months to maturity is their carrying amount.
The fair value of all other deposit liabilities was estimated using discounted cash flows, applying either market rates or rates currently offered by the Group for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities and tier one notes Fair values are based on quoted prices where available, or by using discounted cash flows, applying market rates.

Results for 2004 and 2005 have been prepared using International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as approved by the International Accounting Standards Board that, under European Regulations, are effective or available for early adoption at the Groups first reporting date under IFRS, 31 December 2005.
Certain of these IFRS are only effective from 1 January 2005, and therefore have not been used to restate the 2004 statutory based results.
The 2004 statutory results presented therefore reflect only those standards which permit or require retrospective adoption, reflecting the voluntary exemptions of IFRS1 see note 1v and notes 43 to 46 to the accounts.
If the results under UK GAAP for 2001 to 2003 were to be restated under IFRS, the main adjustments required would be those detailed in notes 44 and 45.
As a result of some IFRS not being required to be implemented until 1 January 2005, to aid comparability of the 2005 results with those of 2004, 2004 results have also been prepared on a proforma basis, incorporating the impact of IFRS where it is possible to determine what the impact would have been if the accounting changes had been effective in 2004.
The proforma results shown for 2004 include the impacts of changes to accounting rules relating to effective interest rate and the reclassification of certain financial instruments from debt to equity, but exclude the effects of hedge accounting under IFRS which differs from that applied under UK GAAP.
The 2005 statutory results include the full effects of the introduction of fair value and hedge accounting following the adoption of IAS 32 and 39 with effect from 1 January 2005.
An underlying set of results for 2005 has also been presented which reflect managements view of the underlying results excluding the effects of fair value volatility and hedge ineffectiveness in order to provide a clearer representation of the underlying performance of the Group.
Further explanation of the proforma and underlying results is provided in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 35 to 45.
Non-recurring costs represent 2002 non-recurring costs incurred in relation to the acquisition of the banking subsidiaries of Legal & General 2003 non-recurring costs incurred in relation to the closure of certain branches 2.
Total assets for 2001 to 2003 represent assets under management, which comprised total balance sheet assets plus non-recourse finance.
There is no difference between total assets and assets under management in 2004 or 2005 3.
Before surplus on sale of credit card portfolio 5.
Post-tax returns are calculated by reference to profit attributable to equity shareholders 2005 statutory and underlying ratios are calculated with reference to proforma profit, asset and equity figures for 2004 where applicable.
Profit growth ratios for 2004 have not been calculated as 2003 results have not been restated under IFRS.
