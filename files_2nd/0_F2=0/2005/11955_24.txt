Germany has a lower tax rate than the UK whilst the US tax rate is higher compared to the UK.
As is common in the motor retail industry, the group also incurs a significant level of other expenses which are not tax deductible mainly depreciation on showrooms and other non deductible capital expenditure.
As a result, it is expected that the effective rate of tax on the groups trading profits will continue to be higher than the standard rate of UK corporation tax.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets There are unutilised tax losses within the group of 13.0m 2004 : 9.6m for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised pending clarity of the availability of intra-EU losses.
