Prior year adjustment Financial Reporting Standard 21 FRS 21 'Events after the Balance Sheet Date' has been adopted for the first time in the year ended 31 December 2005.
Under FRS 21, proposed dividends do not meet the denition of a liability until such time as they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Therefore, we no longer recognise a liability in any period for dividends that have been proposed but will not be approved until after the balance sheet date.
This applies for external dividends as well as intra-group dividends paid to the parent company.
The effect for the company of implementing FRS 21 has been to increase retained profits by 385 million in the current period 2004: decrease of 103 million, decrease dividends creditors due within one year by 385 million 2004: decrease by 367 million, and increase inter-group creditors due within one year by nil 2004: increase of 470 million.
