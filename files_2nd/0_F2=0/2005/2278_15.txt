Discontinued operations At the end of 2003 following more than 2 years of very poor performance the Group decided to exit the electroplating business.
Activity was conducted at 17 sites in 3 countries.
The business was sold piecemeal in 14 transactions with the final transactions being completed in 2005.
With effect from 1 November 2004 the Groups PVD assets were transferred to SSCP Coating Srl which operates under the IonBond brand.
This followed a strategic review by the Group which concluded that the development of the PVD business could be best achieved within the IonBond network.
The Group initially acquired a 15% interest in SSCP Coating Srl in November 2004 and increased its holding to 20% in January 2005 at a total cost of 7.2m.
The results of the discontinued operations, which have been included in the consolidated income statement, were as follows: 2005 2004 m m Revenue 1.5 30.8 Expenses 1.5 40.6 profit before tax.

The effect of discontinued operations on segment results is disclosed in note 2.
As a result of a continued review of the Groups network 5 sites of former heat treatment facilities are held for sale, with a book value of 1.2m.
It is expected that all of the sites will be sold within the next 12 months for an amount in excess of book value and hence no impairment losses have been recognised in 2005.
Non-current assets held for sale comprise property, plant and equipment.

The recoverable amounts of the Business Units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the Business Units.
The growth rates up to 2010 are based on managment forecasts.
Beyond 2010 a growth rate of 2.1% is assumed, being the 50 year average growth in UK GDP.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on management forecasts.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash ows thereafter based on an estimated growth rate of 2.1 per cent.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash ows from all Business Units is 8%.
Goodwill written off in the year relates to a reduction in activity in a North American heat treatment plant 4.0m and disposal of another such plant 1.8m.

Bank overdrafts and loans continued Currency exposures The Groups objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of borrowings and to retain some potential for currency-related appreciation while partially hedging against currency depreciation.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures: in other words, those transactional or non-structural exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
The amounts shown take into account the effect of any forward contracts and other derivatives entered into to manage these currency exposures.
The exposures as at 31 December 2004 were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets US $ Euro SEK Total m m m m Functional currency of Group operation: Sterling 7.4 0.4 0.1 7.9 Euro 2.6.. 2.6 Swiss Franc.

Bank overdrafts and loans continued Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2004.
Book value Fair value m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Financial assets 142.1 142.1 Long-term borrowings 222.4 223.4 Short-term financial liabilities and current portion of long-term borrowings 8.2 8.2 The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts and US Dollar denominated long-term xed rate debt with a carrying amount of 41.8m have been calculated by discounting cash ows at prevailing interest rates.
All the other fair values shown above have been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which the instruments involved are traded.
Gains and losses on hedges The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies when those sales or purchases are transacted.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged position matures.
The unrecognised gains and losses were not material in 2004.
Borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2004, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, as follows: m Expiring in one year or less 17.4 Expiring in more than two years 15.7 Total 33.1 20.
Derivative financial instruments Currency derivatives The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge material future transactions and cash ows.
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
The unrecognised gains and losses were not material either in 2005 or 2004.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts 2004: nil.
At the balance sheet date, 216.6m of foreign currency denominated debt was designated as a hedging instrument for the purpose of hedging the translation of its foreign operations.
Interest rate swaps At the balance sheet date the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.

Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2005 2004 m m Deferred tax liabilities 79.9 72.1 Deferred tax assets 22.7 18.9 57.2 53.2 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 42.8 million 2004: 32.7 million available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 37.5 million 2004: 20.7 million of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 5.3 million 2004: 12.0 million of such losses.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 2.5 million that will expire from 2022 onwards.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 269.4 million 2004: 223.4 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignicant.

The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates to their carrying amount.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors rights over the leased assets.

The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identied, either as part of acquisition due diligence, or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required.
This provision is reviewed annually.
Cash outows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within five years.
The Group has restated the presentation of certain liabilities from long-term payables to provisions and accordingly the comparative information at 1 January 2005 has been restated.
This has reduced long-term payables at 31 December 2004 by 6.7 million and increased long-term provisions by the same amount.
In the opinion of the Directors, this is a more appropriate presentation of these liabilities.
