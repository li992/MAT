Each advance drawn down under the $30 million revolving credit facility is repaid on the last business day of each fixed term interest period typically three to six months.

The interest rate for each advance drawn under the revolving facility is fixed on the date of the advance for the agreed interest period at US dollar LIBOR plus 1.75%.
