Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest risk profile of the Group's financial liabilities at 31 March 2005, after taking account of the interest rate cap used to manage the interest profile was: 2005 2004 Book Floating Rate Book Floating Rate Value Financial Value Financial Total Liabilities Total Liabilities Currency m m m m Sterling term loan 9.0 9.0 10.0 10.0 Sterling bank overdraft 0.2 0.2 9.0 9.0 10.2 10.2 The interest rate on the term loan is based on a floating rate linked to the London Inter Bank Offer Rate LIBOR.
A separate interest rate cap exists to reduce exposure to fluctuations in the LIBOR rate, ensuring that the interest exposure is capped at 6.0%.
The loan has been disclosed as a floating rate financial liability as the interest rate cap has not been breached.
The interest rate on the overdraft is based on a floating rate linked to the Bank of England rate.
All the Group's creditors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the above table either due to the exclusion of short term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability, such as tax balances.

51 Business Post Group plc Notes to the Financial Statements Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group's financial assets and liabilities at 31 March 2005 and 2004.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm's length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Set out below is a summary of the methods and assumptions used for each category of financial instrument.
2005 2004 Book Value Fair Value Book Value Fair Value m m m m Primary financial instrument held or issued to finance the Group's operations: Short term borrowings 1.0 1.0 1.2 1.2 Long term borrowings 8.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 Cash at bank and in hand 3.4 3.4 4.6 4.6 Interest earning long term debtors 6.0 6.0 5.2 5.2 Derivative financial instrument held to manage the interest rate profile: Interest rate cap 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 An interest rate cap agreement, expiring on 31 July 2008, with interest capped at 6%, was taken out during 2004 to minimise exposure to increases in the floating rate of interest on the term loan note 17.
Derivative financial instrument held to manage fuel volatility profile: A fuel forward contract which hedged against fluctuations in the purchase price of diesel was entered into on 1 April 2004, expired on 31 March 2005.
Summary of methods and assumptions Fair value is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance Interest rate cap sheet date.
Short-term deposits and borrowings The fair value of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long term borrowings The fair value of the bank loan approximates to the value reported in the balance sheet since it carries a floating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals less than one year.
"Hedges As explained in the Financial Review section of the Report and Accounts, entitled ""Exposure to Financial Risk"" the Group's policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk - using interest rate hedges Fuel fluctuation - using specific price hedges There are no unrecognised gains or losses arising from the above hedges which have not been charged to the profit and loss account during the year."
