Plan assets The weighted average asset allocations at the year end were as follows: Group Group Company Company Asset category Plan assets at Plan assets at Plan assets at Plan assets at 31st December 31st December 31st December 31st December 2005 2004 2005 2004 %%%% Equities 57 55 61 60 Bonds 22 22 19 19 Gilts 21 22 19 19 Other 0112 Total 100 100 100 100 To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Company considered the level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily Government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio and an allowance made for expected expenses.
This gave an assumed rate of 5.83% net of expenses at 31st December 2005.
The actual return on plan assets in the year ended 31st December 2005 was 20.5m 2004 10.1m.
