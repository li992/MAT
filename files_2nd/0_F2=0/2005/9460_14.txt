Accounting policies The following are the principal accounting policies of the company which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year, with the exception of the changes in accounting policies discussed below.
Basis of accounting The company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards.
Changes in accounting policies The company has adopted the following Financial Reporting Standards FRS in these financial statements: FRS 17 Retirement benefits FRS 20 Share-based Payment FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet FRS 22 Earnings per share FRS 23 The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and Presentation FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement FRS 28 Corresponding amounts The adoption of each of these standards represents a change in accounting policy for the company, although only the adoption of FRS 20, 21, 25 and 26 resulted in an amendment to the companys balance sheet or profit and loss account for either the current or prior year.
The accounting policies adopted in the current year have been applied to all periods presented except for those relating to the measurement, disclosure and presentation of financial instruments, all matters dealt with in FRS 25 and FRS 26.
The company has taken an exemption to apply FRS 25 and FRS 26 prospectively from 1 January 2005.
Details of the impact of the changes in accounting policies are given in note II.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries in the companys balance sheet are held at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Financial instruments The following policies for financial instruments have been applied in the preparation of the company's financial statements.
For those policies that have changed on adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26 on 1 January 2005, policies both before and after adoption are given.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand includes short-term deposits with an original maturity period of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are an integral part of the companys cash management are included in cash at bank and in hand where they have a legal right of set-off against positive cash balances, otherwise bank overdrafts are classified as borrowings.
Debtors Debtors are stated at amounts receivable less any provision for recoverability.
A trade or other receivable is derecognised from the balance sheet when the company enters into a financing transaction which transfers to a third party all significant rights or other access to benefits relating to that asset, and all significant exposures to the risks inherent in that asset.
Borrowings 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004 Borrowings were recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
The finance costs of debt were allocated to financial periods and charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the borrowings at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Accrued finance costs were included in accruals rather than in the carrying amount of the borrowing to the extent that they were due to be paid in cash within one year.
Borrowings 1 January 2005 onwards Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated either at amortised cost or, if designated as such, at fair value through profit or loss.
For borrowings stated at amortised cost, any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation Corporation tax is payable on taxable profits at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised to take account of timing differences between the treatment of transactions for financial reporting purposes and their treatment for tax purposes.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 Company financial statements P91 I.
Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The functional currency of the company is pounds sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the company at the rates prevailing at the dates of the individual transactions.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses arising are charged or credited to the income statement within net operating costs.
Employee benefits Retirement benefits The company participates in retirement benefit plans of a defined contribution nature.
The cost of defined contribution plans is charged to the income statement on the basis of contributions payable by the company during the year.
Share-based payment The cost of share-based employee compensation arrangements, whereby employees receive remuneration in the form of shares or share options, is recognised as an employee benefit expense in the profit and loss account.
The total expense to be apportioned over the vesting period of the benefit is determined by reference to the fair value at the grant date of the shares or share options awarded and the number that are expected to vest.
The assumptions underlying the number of awards expected to vest are subsequently adjusted to reflect conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date.
At the vesting date of an award, the cumulative expense is adjusted to take account of the awards that actually vest.
Other employee benefits A liability for other employee benefits, such as holiday, is recognised for the amount the company may be required to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date.
Employee share ownership trusts Employee share ownership plan ESOP trusts, which purchase and hold ordinary shares of the company in connection with certain employee share schemes, are included in the company financial statements.
Any consideration paid or received by ESOP trusts for the purchase or sale of the companys own shares is shown as a movement in shareholders equity.
Dividends Dividends to the companys shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders equity in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Effect of changes in accounting policies FRS 20 Share-based Payment The company operates a variety of share-based employee incentive arrangements that include the grant of rights to shares or share options, further details of which are provided in note XIII.
FRS 20 requires that an expense is recognised in the profit and loss account based on the fair value of a share award or share option on the date of grant.
The expense is spread over the period for which services are received from employees, which is assumed to be the performance period of the award.
The fair value of share options is measured using an option-pricing model.
The Black-Scholes model has been used to determine the fair value of options granted under SAYE schemes.
A Monte Carlo simulation model has been used for executive share options.
Previously under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract UITF 17 Employee share schemes, a charge was recorded only when an award had intrinsic value on the date of grant i. e. the market value of the companys shares on the date of grant exceeded the exercise price of the award.
A charge was not recorded for share options schemes as the exercise price of share options was set at the prevailing market price on the grant date.
A charge was recorded for the employee and executive equity partnership plans under which rights to shares were granted at no cost to employees, subject to meeting performance conditions.
FRS 20 requires a liability to be recorded for employer social security costs on gains from the exercise of share options.
The liability is measured based on the fair value of non-tax approved share options outstanding at each balance sheet date.
Previously, under UITF 25 National Insurance contributions on share option gains, a liability was recognised based on the intrinsic value of share options at the balance sheet date.
The impact of adopting FRS 20 was to increase the share-based payment expense in the profit and loss account and increase liabilities in the balance sheet.
The effect on the profit and loss account for the year ended 31 December 2005 was to recognise an additional expense of 0.8 million 2004: 0.5 million.
The effect on the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 was to increase liabilities in the balance sheet by 0.2 million and increase related deferred tax assets by 0.1 million.
P92 Company financial statements LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 II.
Effect of changes in accounting policies continued FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date Distributions to equity holders are not recognised in the profit and loss account under FRS 21, they are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders equity.
Previously, dividends were recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account.
A liability is recorded for a final dividend when the dividend is approved by the companys shareholders, and for an interim dividend when the dividend is paid.
Previously, an accrual was made for dividends that were proposed by directors after the balance sheet date but prior to the date of the signing of the financial statements and a corresponding expense was recognised.
The impact on the balance sheet of adopting FRS 21 was to remove the accrual of 25.8 million for the 2004 proposed final dividend previously recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004.
The effect of the changes in accounting policies on adoption on FRS 20 and FRS 21 on the profit and loss account and balance sheet is summarised below: 2005 2004 m m Profit and loss account Net operating costs 0.8 0.5 Decrease in profit for the year 0.8 0.5 2004 m Balance sheet Debtors 0.1 Creditors amounts falling due within one year 25.6 Increase in net assets 25.7 FRS 25 and FRS 26 Financial instruments The company has a commitment to issue new ordinary shares on conversion of the convertible bonds issued by LogicaCMG Jersey Limited, another group company see note 22 of the consolidated financial statements.
The impact of adopting FRS 25 and FRS 26 was to recognise a financial liability for the call option over the companys ordinary shares.
The fair value of the call option was measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the following assumptions used at 31 December 2005 and 1 January 2005: 31 December 1 January 2005 2005 Share price on measurement date 1.77 1.93 Exercise price 3.24 3.73 Expected volatility 56% 59% Expected life years 2.7 3.7 Risk free rate 2.9% 2.8% Dividend yield 2.9% 2.1% Expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility of the companys share price.
The period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 was excluded as management believe it represented a period of high share price volatility which is unlikely to be repeated in the future.
The effect on the balance sheet was to increase financial liabilities, and reduce reserves, at 1 January 2005 by 26.2 million, together with a reduction in the corporation tax debtor of 2.2 million and a related increase in deferred tax assets of 2.2 million.
The effect on the profit and loss account for the year ended 31 December 2005 was to increase interest payable and other similar charges by 7.1 million.
The company has taken advantage of the exemptions available in FRS 13 para 3 b and FRS 25 para 3 c b not to disclose any information relating to financial instruments as the companys financial statements are included in publicly available consolidated financial statements.
Profit attributable to the company As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the company.
The profit for the financial year for the company was 86.7 million 2004 restated: 88.1 million.

V. Dividends The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005 of 3.2 pence per share, which would reduce shareholders funds by 36.2 million.
The proposed dividend is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2006 and has not been recognised as a liability in these financial statements.
The proposed final dividend has been set at a level that reflects the bonus element of the rights issue that took place in November 2005.
The amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders were as follows: Restated Restated 2005 2004 2005 2004 p share p share m m Interim dividend, relating to 2005 2004 2.11 2.02 17.7 16.9 Final dividend, relating to 2004 2003 3.08 2.99 25.8 25.0 5.19 5.01 43.5 41.9 Dividends per share have been restated for the bonus element of the rights issue.

Share-based payment Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements The company operates four equity-settled share-based payment arrangements: the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, the Sharesave scheme, the Executive Equity Partnership Plan ExEPP and the Employee Equity Partnership Plan EmEPP.
A summary of the main terms of the arrangements is given below, with particular reference to the terms of those grants for which a share-based payment expense has been recognised.
Executive Share Option Scheme Option grants under the ESOS are made to senior executives and managers across the company, as well as to staff with high potential or to recognise significant achievements.
Options will normally be exercisable between three and ten years following grant, provided that a performance condition, specified at the date of grant, has been satisfied.
Typically, growth in the groups earnings per share over the relevant performance period is required to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 21 per cent for the performance condition to be met.
ESOS option grants prior to 2005 have a maximum seven year exercise period, however, option grants in 2005 have a four year exercise period.
Retesting of performance conditions may be carried out twice for 2003 option grants, once for 2004 option grants and no retesting is permitted on grants made in 2005.
The exercise price of ESOS options is generally at least equal to the mid-market price of the companys shares on the date of grant, although the pricing mechanism varies slightly for grants to French employees.
Sharesave Scheme The company operates a savings-related share-option scheme under which employees enter into a savings contract with a financial institution to pay a fixed monthly sum for either a three or, for grants before 4 October 2002, five year period.
Share options are granted, at an exercise price at least equal to the mid-market price of the companys shares on the date of grant, such that the aggregate exercise price payable is equal to the expected proceeds on maturity of the savings contract.
Share options may be exercised within six months of the vesting date.
There are no performance conditions attached to sharesave scheme options.
P98 Company financial statements LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 XIII.
Share-based payment continued Equity Partnership Plans The company operates an equity partnership plan for senior executives, the ExEPP, and an equity partnership plan open to all employees in certain countries, the EmEPP, the terms of which are similar.
Under the equity partnership plans, employees make an investment in the companys shares, subject to financial limits, which must be maintained over a three year vesting period.
Awards of a matching number of shares are made at nil cost to employees and are exercisable for up to seven years after the vesting date, after which the award will lapse.
Vesting will occur for those participants employed at the vesting date, subject to a performance condition being met.
The performance conditions vary by scheme and grant date.
Typically, growth in the groups earnings per share must exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by between 3 per cent and 7 per cent per annum, dependant on the scheme and grant date, in each year in the performance period for the award to vest in full.
The Remuneration Committee may, at its discretion, allow matching awards under the EmEPP to vest pro rata if performance conditions are met in only one or two years out of the three year performance period.
A reconciliation of the movement in the number of share options and share awards held by employees and directors of the company is shown below: 2005 Share options Share awards Weighted average exercise Number of price Number of shares shares Outstanding at 1 January 2005 4,316,726 3.86 54,285 Granted 1,200,000 1.81 Exercised 8 Forfeited 4,286 2.26 Expired 2,690 6.27 Outstanding at 9 October 2005 5,509,750 3.41 54,277 Impact of rights issue 758,693 0.41 7,474 Outstanding at 9 October 2005 6,268,443 3.00 61,751 Expired 610 5.51 Outstanding at 31 December 2005 6,267,833 3.00 61,751 Exercisable at 31 December 2005 1,130,466 3.11 15,362 2004 Share options Share awards Weighted average exercise Number of price Number of shares shares Outstanding at 1 January 2004 4,322,583 3.86 13,582 Granted 705 2.67 40,774 Expired 6,562 2.99 71 Outstanding at 31 December 2004 4,316,726 3.86 54,285 Exercisable at 31 December 2004 993,641 3.54 13,503 The number of share options outstanding on 9 October 2005 and their respective exercise prices were adjusted to take account of the bonus element of the rights issue during 2005.
The exercise price of share options outstanding was repriced by applying an adjustment factor of 0.87896.
In addition, the number of share options outstanding was increased for each share option holder, in proportion to their holding, by the reciprocal factor of 1.13770.
The adjustment factor of 1.13770 was also applied to the number of shares awards outstanding under the Equity Partnership Plans on the same date.
Where the adjustment to the number of share options and awards did not give rise to a whole number, the number of share options and awards were rounded down to the nearest whole number on an  basis.
The adjustments to the exercise price of share options and the number of share options and share awards did not have a material impact on the aggregate fair value of share options and share awards outstanding.

The balance are exercised after 10 years, providing the options are in the money.
The fair value of ESOS options was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the fair value of Sharesave scheme options was measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value of share awards under the Equity Partnership Plans was measured at the market share price at the date of grant reduced for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period, for which award holders have no entitlement.
Expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility of the companys share price over a period commensurate with the expected life of the share option.
Share awards under the Equity Partnership Plans are assumed to be exercised on the vesting date.
Sharesave options are assumed to be exercised three months after the vesting date, the mid-point of the contractual exercise period.
At the date of grant, it is assumed that performance conditions will be met in full.
Adjustments are made subsequently, where necessary, to reflect updated assessments of whether performance conditions will be met and the final determination on the vesting date.
The share-based payment expense also takes account of expected forfeiture from the balance sheet date to the end of the vesting period following cessation of employment.
A weighted average forfeiture rate of 10 per cent per annum was assumed for calculating the share-based payment expense for the year ended 31 December 2005 2004: 5 per cent.
The company recognised a total expense in respect of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements of 0.7 million in the year ended 31 December 2005 2004: 0.5 million.

The liability for cash-settled share-based social security payments at 31 December 2005 was 0.3 million 2004: 0.2 million.
