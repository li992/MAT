Exceptional Items 000 000 Exceptional items: recognised within operating profit loss Costs relating to settlement of regulatory issues 38,519 Release provision for Uplift Plan to eligible investors in Aberdeen Progressive Growth Unit Trust 2,600 39,200 Expenses in relation to cost reduction and rationalisation programme 6,829 Costs of aborted sale, subsequent rationalisation and other costs 760 2,600 85,308 In 2005, following a re-assessment of the potential liability, in light of improved market conditions, 2,600,000 was released from the provision for the costs of the Uplift Plan offered to eligible investors in Aberdeen Progressive Growth Unit Trust.
In 2004 exceptional items arose for the following reasons: Certain subsidiaries had been involved in investigations instigated by the Financial Services Authority and the Jersey Financial Services Commission which had been in progress since 2002.
The Group had incurred considerable costs in the provision of information to the investigators and in taking legal advice on its defence against any allegations made.
As announced on 24 December 2004, the Group, in common with other firms involved in these investigations, agreed to make a voluntary contribution to a central fund to achieve resolution of this issue, which otherwise could have continued for some time.
The voluntary contribution of 35,000,000 and 3,519,000 of costs relating to the Groups involvement in these investigations, were treated as exceptional costs.
The provision for the cost of the Uplift Plan offered to eligible investors in Aberdeen Progressive Unit Trust of 39,200,000 represented the estimated cost to the Group, discounted to net present value, in accordance with UK GAAP.
Expenses in relation to the cost reduction and rationalisation programme represented redundancy, office closure and one-off outsourcing costs incurred following the acquisition of Edinburgh Fund Managers Group plc in October 2003.
Exceptional items: recognised within interest payable and similar charges An exceptional non-cash interest charge of 3,000,000 is recorded in respect of the unwinding of the discount on the provision made in 2004 note 7.
Costs of 1,670,000 relating to bond expenses written off during the year and repayment premium costs incurred have been treated as exceptional.
The amount written off, net of taxation, was 1,169,000.
Gains on disposal of investments 000 000 Gain on disposal of significant investments 12,484 Loss gain on disposal of subsidiaries 3,616 1,940 Exceptional gains 8,868 1,940 Gain on disposal of other investments 1,163 Total gains 10,031 1,940 The Group disposed of its investment in the ordinary shares of Lombard International Assurance SA Lombard, a Luxembourg registered life company, on 11 January 2005 to Friends Provident plc.
The Groups holding represented approximately 15% of the equity of Lombard, the original cost of which was 1,163,000.
The gain on disposal recognised to date, net of expenses, is 12,484,000.
Further consideration will be received in April 2006 and April 2007, dependent on Lombard achieving or exceeding certain performance targets for both new business profits and growth in embedded value for the two financial years to 31 December 2006.
The further consideration will be paid in cash or Friends Provident ordinary shares, at Friends Providents option.
No tax arose on the disposal of this asset as it was held in a jurisdiction in which no tax was charged on the capital gain.
46 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC The loss on disposal of subsidiaries of 3,616,000 represents the loss realised on disposal of the Groups Isle of Man and Guernsey life assurance subsidiaries.
This loss is reduced by 2,796,000 of contingent deferred proceeds received in the current year in respect of disposals completed in previous years.
The above items are considered to be exceptional items as defined by FRS 3.
The Group also received 1,163,000 of deferred proceeds in respect of the sale of Asset Value Investors Limited which was sold in 2004.
These proceeds form an element of a wider transaction, the substance of which was to retain an interest in an ongoing revenue stream until 30 September 2006, and are therefore not considered to be exceptional.
2005 2004 Gain on disposal of management contracts 000 000 Proceeds of disposal 507 Less: related costs of disposal 86 Profit on disposal of management contracts 421 The gain on disposal of management contracts in 2004 relates to the sale of the management rights of a Dublin registered unit trust contract.

Payments to eligible investors are being made over the period to October 2006.
In accordance with the provisions of FRS 12 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, provision for the potential cost was made on the basis of the best estimate of the cost to the Group discounted to net present value.
The charge shown above represents the unwinding of the discount to 30 September 2005.

The tax benefit of these lower rates is one of timing only, to the extent that these overseas profits are subsequently remitted to the UK.
Deferred tax assets arising in the UK, principally due to tax losses, amounting to 15,557,000 2004 - 11,553,000 have not been recognised due to the lack of certainty as to the utilisation of these assets.
Deferred tax assets amounting to 283,000 2004 - 624,000 have not been recognised in certain overseas subsidiaries due to the lack of certainty as to the utilisation of these assets.

The figures originally reported were 2.0p per share for each of the interim and second interim payments in 2004 and 2.2p per share for the 2005 interim payment.
The theoretical ex-rights price TERP of the ordinary shares was 99.9p, calculated on the basis of the closing market price of 1.5525 on 31 August 2005 and the subscription price of 63p under the rights issue.
Earnings per share and dividend per share figures for 2004 and the first half of 2005 have therefore been restated in accordance with accounting standards, using a factor of 1.554054, i. e. the market price of 155.25p on 31 August 2005 divided by the TERP of 99.9p.

Contingent liabilities On 28 June 2005, proceedings were issued against Aberdeen Asset Management PLC and Aberdeen Asset Managers Jersey Limited together the Aberdeen Parties and a non-Aberdeen party, in the High Court in London by Real Estate Opportunities Limited REO.
In 2003, the board of REO announced, with regard to the Aberdeen parties, that REO had terminated its management contract with immediate effect and indicated that it held the Aberdeen Parties liable for damages in respect of losses incurred on REOs income portfolio.
The Aberdeen Parties do not accept the validity of REOs termination without notice.
The Aberdeen Parties believe that the claim is without merit and will vigorously defend the proceedings and counterclaim for their accrued fees and the fees relating to the 12 months notice period provided for in the management contract and accordingly no provision is considered necessary.

An element of the purchase price in respect of the equities and multiasset business.

The current estimate of the deferred amount payable is 35 million but the actual amount payable remains subject to adjustment until 30 June 2006.
Based on this estimate the total goodwill arising on the transaction amounted to 204.4 million.
