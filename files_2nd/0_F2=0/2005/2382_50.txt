They are classified as repayable within one year, as required under IFRS, as the bondholders typically have the option to tender these bonds for repayment on interest reset dates.
Any bonds that are tendered are usually remarketed and BP has not experienced any significant repurchases.
BP considers these bonds to represent long-term funding when assessing the maturity profile of its finance debt and they are reflected as such in the borrowings repayment schedule below.
Other similar loans linked to long-term gas supply contracts of $992 million 2004 $280 million and 2003 nil that mature over 10 years have been reported in the same way.
At 31 December 2005, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, including committed facilities of $4,500 million expiring in 2006 $4,500 million expiring in 2005 and $3,700 million expiring in 2004.
These facilities are with a number of international banks and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates.
The group expects to renew the facilities on an annual basis.
Certain of these facilities support the groups commercial paper programme.
At 31 December 2005, the groups share of third-party finance debt of jointly controlled entities and associates was $3,266 million 2004 $2,821 million and 2003 $2,151 million and $970 million 2004 $1,048 million and 2003 $922 million respectively.
These amounts are not reflected in the groups debt on the balance sheet.
Under UK GAAP, where finance debt is swapped into another currency, the finance debt is accounted in the swap currency and not in the original currency of denomination.
Total finance debt in 2004 and 2003 included an asset of $835 million and $745 million respectively for the carrying value of currency swaps and forward contracts.
FAIR VALUES OF FINANCE DEBT For 2005, the estimated fair value of finance debt is shown in the table below together with the carrying amount as reflected in the balance sheet.
Both the fair value and the carrying amount include the effects of currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward contracts.
Long-term borrowings in the table below include debt that matures in the year from 31 December 2005, whereas in the balance sheet the amount would be reported under current liabilities.
Long-term borrowings also include US Industrial Revenue Municipal Bonds classified on the balance sheet as current liabilities.
The carrying value of the groups short-term borrowings, comprising mainly commercial paper, bank loans and overdrafts, approximates their fair value.
The fair value of the groups long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations is estimated using quoted prices or, where these are not available, discounted cash flow analyses based on the groups current incremental borrowing rates for similar types and maturities of borrowing.
The weighted average interest rate on finance debt is 5%.

Aside from debt issued in the US municipal bond markets, interest rates on floating rate debt denominated in US dollars are linked principally to London Inter-Bank Offer Rate LIBOR, while rates on debt in other currencies are based on local market equivalents.
The group monitors interest rate risk using a process of sensitivity analysis.
Assuming no changes to the finance debt and hedges described above, it is estimated that a change of 1% in the general level of interest rates on 1 January 2006 would change 2006 profit before tax by approximately $180 million.
The group uses finance leases to acquire property, plant and equipment.
These leases have terms of renewal but no purchase options and escalation clauses.
Renewals are at the option of the lessee.
During the year, the group terminated its finance leases on the petrochemicals manufacturing plant at Grangemouth, Scotland.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases are set out below.
