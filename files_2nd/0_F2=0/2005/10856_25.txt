Notes to the Accounts 1 CORPORATE INFORMATION The consolidated accounts of National Express Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2005 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 9 March 2006 and the balance sheets were signed on the boards behalf by PM White and AC Walker.
National Express Group PLC is a limited company incorporated in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Operating Review and the Financial Review that accompany these accounts.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Statement of compliance These accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committees IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union EU, and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group is required to comply with international accounting requirements under IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Information except in extremely rare circumstances where management concludes that compliance would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective to present fairly its accounts.
On this basis, the Group has departed from the requirements of IAS 19, Employee Benefits and has accounted for its constructive but not legal obligations for the Railways Pension Scheme RPS under the terms of its UK rail franchise agreements.
Details of the background and rationale for this departure are provided in note 36, including the impact on the Groups reported financial performance and position of adopting this accounting treatment as required by IAS 1.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
Basis of preparation As a company registered and listed in an EU country, National Express Group PLC has been required to adopt IFRS with effect from 1 January 2005.
The results for the year ended 31 December 2005 represent the Groups first annual report and accounts prepared in accordance with its accounting policies under IFRS.
Previously the Group reported under UK generally accepted accounting policies UK GAAP.
UK GAAP to IFRS reconciliations of equity for 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004, and of profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 are summarised in note 40.
As noted above, the Group has taken the extremely rare decision to depart from the requirement of IAS 19 Retirement Benefits so as to present fairly its financial performance, position and cash flows in respect of its obligation for the RPS.
The details of this departure and impact on the Groups accounts are set out in note 36.
A summary of the Groups accounting policies applied in preparing the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005 are set out below.
The most significant accounting policy changes arising on the transition to IFRS, along with the policies applied on the transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 are set out in note 40.
The preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets including goodwill and measurement of defined benefit pension obligations.
The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves estimation of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The Group determines whether indefinite life intangible assets are impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated.
This requires estimation of future cash flows and choosing a suitable discount rate see note 14.
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality rates, the expected return on assets and the choice of a suitable discount rate see note 36.
The consolidated accounts are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand 0.1m except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts comprise the accounts of National Express Group PLC and all its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
Adjustments are made to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in full.
On acquisition of a business, the acquisition method of accounting is adopted, and the Group income statement includes the results of subsidiaries and businesses purchased during the year from the date control is assumed.
Purchase consideration is allocated to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
On the sale of a business, the Group income statement includes the results of that business to the date of disposal.
45 Notes to the Accounts 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Basis of consolidation continued Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately from parent shareholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
Interests in joint ventures The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures which take the form of agreements to share control of other entities.
The Group recognises its interest in the entitys assets and liabilities using the equity method of accounting.
The Group balance sheet includes the appropriate share of these joint ventures net assets and the income statement an appropriate share of their results after tax.
Accounts of jointly controlled entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group and where necessary adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.
Adjustments are also made in the Groups accounts to eliminate the Groups share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its jointly controlled entities.
The Group ceases to use the equity method from the date it no longer has joint control over, or significant influence in, the joint venture.
Interests in associates Companies, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures, in which the Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting rights and over which it exerts significant influence are treated as associates.
The Group accounts include the appropriate share of these associates results and reserves based on their latest accounts under the equity method.
Revenue recognition Rendering of services Revenue comprises income from road passenger transport, train passenger services, airport operations and related activities in the UK, North America and Europe.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales tax.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as a proportion of total services to be provided.
UK Trains revenue includes amounts attributed to the train operating companies TOCs, based principally on agreed models of route usage, by Railway Settlement Plan Limited which administers the income allocation system within the UK rail industry, in respect of passenger receipts.
In addition, franchise agreement receipts from the Strategic Rail Authority SRA, the Department for Transport Rail Division DfT Rail and local Passenger Transport Executives PTEs are treated as revenue.
Franchise agreement payments to the SRA DfT Rail are recognised in operating costs.
UK Coach revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales.
UK Bus and European Coach & Bus Alsa revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales and revenue generated from services provided on behalf of local transport authorities, which is recognised as the services are provided.
The attributable share of season ticket or travelcard income is deferred within liabilities and released to the income statement over the life of the relevant season ticket or travelcard.
North American Bus revenue from local authorities and similar contracts is recognised as the services are provided.
Rental income Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Interest income Revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method.
Government grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in non-current liabilities as deferred income and are credited to the income statement over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned.
Other grants are credited to the income statement as the related expenditure is expensed.
Segmental reporting Each of the Groups business and geographical segments provide services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of the other business segments.
Due to the nature of the Groups operations the distinct business segments align directly with distinct geographical segments which are operating in separate economic environments.
The Groups segments comprise: UK Buses: UK Coaches: UK Trains: North American Bus: European Coach & Bus Alsa : and Central functions.
These segments are described in more detail in the Operating Review and the Financial Review accompanying these accounts.
Operations in our North America Public Transit segment and our Australia Bus segment were discontinued in 2005 and 2004 respectively.
The assets of the operations are disclosed in disposal group assets classified as held for sale and liabilities disclosed in liabilities directly associated with disposal group assets classified as held for sale reflecting the fact that the carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale and not through continuing use.
46 Notes to the Accounts 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Leases Leases of property, plant and equipment where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment.
Finance leases are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Incentives received under operating leases and initial direct costs in negotiating the lease are amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of lease.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred in accordance with the benchmark accounting treatment under IAS 23, Borrowing Costs.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are material items of income or expenditure which due to their nature and infrequency require separate identification on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the year, in comparison to prior years.
Exceptional items include, but are not restricted to, reorganisation, redundancy and start-up costs for significant contracts.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
Land and buildings comprise mainly vehicle depots and garages, and offices.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 30 to 50 years Long leasehold property improvements 15 to 40 years Public service vehicles 8 to 15 years Plant and equipment, fixtures and fittings 3 to 15 years The carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement in the period of derecognition.
Investment property Any of the Groups properties that are surplus to requirements are classified as investment properties, being held for long-term investment to earn rental income.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, and subsequently remeasured to fair value, reflecting market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair values of investment properties are included in the income statement as they arise.
47 Notes to the Accounts 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and when acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, the historic cost model is applied to intangible assets.
Where amortisation is charged on finite life assets, this expense is taken to the income statement through operating expenses.
Finite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer contracts over the life of the contract between 1 and 5 years Right to operate TOC franchises over the life of the franchise between 1 and 7 years Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and the useful lives of finite assets are examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, made on a prospective basis.
Finite life assets are reviewed for impairment where indicators of impairment exist.
The Groups indefinite life intangible assets include customer relationships and goodwill.
Customer relationship intangible assets are recognised only on contracts which are presumed to automatically be renewed, based on historical experience of the market in which the contract operates.
Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is stated at historic cost less any accumulated impairment in value.
If an acquisition gives rise to negative goodwill this is credited directly to the consolidated income statement.
In accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, goodwill is not amortised.
All goodwill is subject to an annual test of impairment and an impairment charge recognised as required.
The net book value of goodwill that was capitalised in the restated balance sheets at both 1 January 2004 the date of transition to IFRS and 31 December 2004 has been tested for impairment.
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions.
Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended within one year of the acquisition if required, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, in order to refine adjustments to reflect further evidence gained post acquisition.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and all or part of that unit is disposed the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on the disposal of the operation.
Impairment of non-current assets Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, financial assets and other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, except for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill which are reviewed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
A review is made at each reporting date of any previous impairment losses to assess whether they no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and any previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to assess the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased, subject to a limit of the assets net book value, had no previous impairment loss been recognised.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
Future amortisation is then adjusted to allocate the assets revised carrying amount over its remaining useful economic life.
Financial assets The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates the designation at each year end.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value.
As explained in note 40 the Group followed the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 to adopt IAS 32, Financial instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 January 2005.
Prior to 1 January 2005 the Group held investments at historic cost less any provision for impairment.
48 Notes to the Accounts 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Financial assets continued Held to maturity investments Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments are classified here when the Group has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
These financial assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Loans and receivables Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified in any of the other categories.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Fair values Where there is no active market for the Groups financial assets, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flow analyses.
Otherwise assets are carried at amortised cost.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
Doubtful debts are provided for when collection of the full amount is no longer probable, whilst bad debts are written off when identified.
Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs associated with securing new rail franchises are expensed as incurred except where it is virtually certain that a franchise will be awarded, in which case they are recognised as an asset and are expensed to the income statement over the life of the franchise.
Costs associated with the commencement of all new contracts other than rail franchises are expensed as incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short-term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception and bank overdrafts.
In the consolidated balance sheet cash includes cash and cash equivalents excluding bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
All are carried on the balance sheet at cost.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost being the net fair value of the consideration received.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when reimbursement is virtually certain.
The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses the Group purchases insurance cover from a selection of proven and financially strong insurers.
The insurance provision is based on estimated exposures at the year end principally for claims arising in the UK and North America prior to the year end date, subject to the overall stop loss within the Groups insurance arrangements.
The majority of provisions will be utilised within six years, and the provision has been discounted to take account of the expected timing of future cash settlements.
49 Notes to the Accounts 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group has a number of pension schemes, both of a defined benefit and defined contribution nature.
Full details are provided in note 36 including the departure from IAS 19 required for the Groups RPS obligations as outlined in the Statement of Compliance.
The liability in respect of defined benefit schemes comprises the total for each scheme of the present value of the relevant defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
The trustees complete a full actuarial valuation triennially, separately for each plan, but the obligation is updated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method for financial reporting purposes.
The present value of the obligation is determined by the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity equivalent to the terms of the related liability.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are recognised in staff pension costs within operating costs in the income statement.
Past service costs are included in operating costs where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The expected return on assets of funded defined benefit schemes and the interest on pension scheme liabilities comprise the finance element of the pension cost and are also included in operating costs.
In accordance with the amendment to IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to pension plans are charged or credited to the statement of recognised income or expense in the period in which they arise.
Our TOCs participate in the RPS, a defined benefit scheme which covers the whole of the UK Rail industry.
This is partitioned into sections and the Group is responsible for the funding of these sections whilst it operates the relevant franchise.
In contrast to the pension schemes operated by most businesses, the RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% employer and 40% employee.
A liability is recognised in line with other defined benefit schemes in the Group, although this is offset by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability represents the deficit that the Group expects to fund during the franchise term.
This represents a departure from IAS 19 so as to present fairly the Groups financial performance, position and cash flow in respect of its obligations for the RPS.
The charges in respect of defined contribution schemes are recognised when they are due.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Share-based payments The Group applied the requirements of IFRS 2, Share-based Payment with effect from 1 January 2004.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant including market based performance conditions.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using the stochastic model.
Non-market based performance related vesting conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value: instead those non-market conditions are taken into account in calculating the current best estimate of the number of shares that will vest.
At each balance sheet date, before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, and the movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Share capital, share premium and dividends Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where the Company purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any transaction costs, is deducted from total shareholders equity as Own shares until they are cancelled or reissued.
Where employee share trusts purchase the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any transaction costs, is deducted from total shareholders equity as Own shares until they are issued.
Any consideration subsequently received on sale or re-issue is included in shareholders equity.
Dividends are recorded as a liability in the period in which the liability to pay shareholders arises.
Current tax and deferred tax Current tax is provided on taxable profits earned according to the local rates applicable where the profits are earned.
Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, in respect of all material temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, except on the initial recognition of non-deductible goodwill and in respect of investment in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
50 Notes to the Accounts 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Current tax and deferred tax continued Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not in that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax is recognised directly in equity if the underlying transaction giving rise to the temporary difference is recognised directly in equity.
Foreign currencies The trading results of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into sterling, the presentation currency of the Group and functional currency of the parent, using average rates of exchange for the year as a reasonable approximation to actual exchange rates at the dates of transactions.
The balance sheets of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange differences arising are taken directly to the translation reserve in equity.
On disposal of a foreign currency denominated subsidiary, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the translation reserve since 1 January 2004 under the transitional rules of IFRS 1 relating to that entity are recognised in the income statement.
All other translation differences are taken to the income statement, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group net investments in foreign enterprises.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments The Group followed the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 and the accounting policy after 1 January 2005 is as follows: The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward exchange contracts, fuel price swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency, fuel price and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported balance sheet.
The fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, interest rate and fuel price swaps is calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end.
In relation to cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the income statement.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the income statement in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency forward currency contracts are used to hedge our net investment in foreign currency denominated operations and to the extent they are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in equity against foreign exchange exposure in the related assets.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, gains or losses are taken directly to the income statement in the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that date any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, or transferred to the income statement if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.
The accounting policy applied prior to 1 January 2005 is as follows: The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate exposures and fuel swaps to hedge fuel price exposures.
The Group considers that these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting when certain criteria are met.
The Groups criteria for these swaps are that the instrument must be related to an asset, liability or future obligation and it must change the character of the interest rate or fuel price by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
These swaps are not revalued to fair value or included in the Group balance sheet at the period end.
New standards adopted early The Group has implemented the following standards earlier than required and restated the prior year comparatives in line with them: IAS 19 Amendment EU adopted Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations 51 Notes to the Accounts 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued New standards and interpretations not applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these accounts: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 1 January 2006 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 39 Fair Value Option 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Amendments to IAS 39 Transition and Initial Recognition of 1 January 2006 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Day 1 profits IAS 39 Cash Flow Hedge Accounting 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Financial Guarantee Contracts 1 January 2006 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease 1 January 2006 Upon adoption of IFRS 7 the Group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail although there will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
Apart from this the Directors do not anticipate the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups accounts in the period of initial application.
3 EXCHANGE RATES The most significant exchange rates to the pound for the Group are as follows: 2005 2005 2004 2004 Closing rate Average rate Closing rate Average rate US dollar 1.72 1.82 1.92 1.84 Canadian dollar 2.00 2.20 2.31 2.38 Euro 1.45 1.47 n a n a Australian dollar 2.35 2.39 2.45 2.48 The 2005 average rate for Euros reflects the average rate since the Alsa acquisition.
If the results for the year to 31 December 2004 were retranslated at the average exchange rates for the year to 31 December 2005, North America would have achieved normalised operating profit of 29.9m on revenue of 215.5m, compared to normalised operating profit of 29.6m on revenue of 213.2m as reported note 5.
Normalised results are defined as the statutory results before the following as appropriate: profit or loss on the sale of businesses and charges for goodwill impairment, intangible amortisation, property, plant and equipment impairments, profit or loss on disposal of non-current assets, exceptional items and tax relief on qualifying exceptional items.

b Share schemes i Executive Share Option Plan The Company operates tax approved and unapproved executive share option schemes open to Group employees in senior management positions and executive directors.
Options granted by this Plan have a maximum term of between seven and ten years.
The options vest after three years subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria based on the achievement of a target growth in earnings per share.
If the performance criteria are not met when initially tested, in some instances they may be reassessed during the term of the option.
From 2005 executive share option grants have been replaced by awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan, as described in iii.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
ii Savings Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave scheme The National Express Group approved Sharesave scheme enables eligible UK employees, including executive directors, to acquire shares in the Company through monthly savings over a three year period, at the end of which they also receive a tax free bonus.
The savings and bonus may be used to purchase shares at the option price set at the beginning of the savings contract.
The options mature three years after the grant date and may be exercised for a period of up to six months after this date.
The latest scheme matured on 1 December 2005.
iii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was introduced in 2005 on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee to replace the annual award of executive share options to executive directors and the executive committee.
Under the LTIP a Performance Award to acquire a specified number of shares for free may be made to the employee.
In addition a Matching Award may be made, as described in iv.
Performance conditions are attached to the vesting of Performance and Matching Awards based on the achievement of target growth in earnings per share and on the relative total shareholder return TSR of the Company against a comparator group of companies.
If the performance conditions are met Performance and Matching Awards vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and remain exercisable for a period of up to six months following the vesting date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives at present.
iv Share Matching Plan the Plan The Share Matching Plan was introduced in 2005 as part of the new Long Term Incentive Plan arrangements described in iii.
Under the Plan a Matching Award to acquire a specified number of shares for free may be made if the employee pledges a number of shares as investment shares which are then matched by the Company on either a 1:1 or 2:1 gross basis.
The Matching Awards vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and remain exercisable for a period of up to six months following the vesting date.
v Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan The Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan is a discretionary scheme which forms part of the bonus arrangements for certain senior employees.
Under the scheme part of any bonus may be received in cash whilst the remainder is used to make an award of nil cost options which vest three years after the award date.
The options must be exercised within three months of vesting.
vi West Midlands Travel Ltd WMT Long Service Option Scheme The WMT Long Service Option Scheme utilises a fixed amount of shares set aside for this purpose following the acquisition of WMT in 1995 and is open to all WMT employees who have been in service for more than 25 years.
The options are exercisable between three and ten years following the grant date.

Included in the charge for share based payment transactions is 2.1m 2004: nil which relates to share options granted under the TWM SIP which vested immediately.
No charge has been included in respect of options granted in 2004 under the TWM SIP in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 2 as these options had vested as of 1 January 2005.
For the following disclosure, share options with a nil exercise price have been disclosed separately to avoid distorting the weighted average exercise prices.
The number of share options in existence during the year was as follows: 2005 2004 Weighted Weighted Number average Number average of share exercise of share exercise options price p options price p Options without a nil exercise price: 1 At 1 January 7,594,301 587 8,238,485 568 Granted during the year 49,534 883 1,104,346 682 Lapsed during the year 979,569 658 1,111,156 612 Exercised during the year 1,856,558 471 637,374 470 1 Outstanding at 31 December 4,807,708 620 7,594,301 587 Exercisable at 31 December 1,632,374 786 2,218,870 807 Options without a nil exercise price: At 1 January 11,002 nil Granted during the year 711,271 nil 11,002 nil Lapsed during the year 5,974 nil Outstanding at 31 December 716,299 nil 11,002 nil Exercisable at 31 December Total outstanding at 31 December 5,524,007 7,605,303 Total exercisable at 31 December 1,632,374 2,218,870 1 Included within this balance are options over 2,360,125 2004: 4,786,081 shares that have not been recognised in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 as the options were granted before 7 November 2002 and have not been subsequently modified.
59 Notes to the Accounts 8 SHARE BASED PAYMENTS continued The options outstanding at 31 December 2005 had exercise prices that were between 398p and 1224p 2004: between 398p and 1224p excluding options with a nil exercise price.
Options were exercised regularly throughout the year and the weighted average share price at exercise was 863p 2004: 702p.
The fair value of share options granted during the year under the TWM SIP was measured using the market price at the grant date.
The weighted average fair value of the remaining share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, with the following assumptions and inputs: Share options without Share options with nil exercise price nil exercise price 2005 2004 2005 2004 Risk free interest rate 4.3%-4.8% 4.7%-5.1% 4.8% 4.8% Expected volatility 27.6%-28.0% 28.0% 25.0%-27.0% 29.0% Expected option life in years 8 years 8 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 3.4% 3.7%-3.9% 3.3%-3.7% 3.9% Weighted average share price 871p-888p 685p-716p 838p-906p 679p Weighted average exercise price 875p-888p 681p-716p 0p 0p Weighted average fair value of options granted 175p-183p 139p-149p 561p-821p 606p Experience to date has shown that approximately 15% 2004: 15% of options are exercised early, principally due to redundancies.
This has been incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price.
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historic volatility over the last eight years, adjusted for one-off events that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward.
The expected dividend yield represents the dividends declared in the 12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price in the month preceding the date of the grant.
For share options granted during the year under the LTIP, the TSR targets have been reflected in the calculation of the fair value of the options above.

The Group has determined that undistributed profits of its overseas subsidiaries will not be distributed in the near future.
In any case the temporary difference associated with group investments is nil 2004: nil as a result of insufficient funds being available.
e Unrecognised tax losses There is no recognition of the deferred tax asset in relation to the excess overseas tax losses on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence to determine that they are recoverable.
Overseas deferred tax assets that the Group has not recognised in the accounts amount to 37.6m 2004: 36.4m, of which 0.8m will expire between 2012 and 2020.
In addition, there are capital losses of 30.2m 2004: 2.4m which have not been recognised, recoverability of which is dependent on capital gains arising.
The majority of the increase to the deferred tax on capital losses in the year relates to the disposal of the North American Public Transit operations of 27.9m.

Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity shareholders of 2.8m 2004: profit of 62.2m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by employees share ownership trusts and those held as treasury shares which are both treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year is adjusted to include the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The reconciliation of weighted average number of ordinary shares is detailed as follows: 2005 2004 Basic weighted average shares 136,591,474 136,166,921 Adjustment for dilutive potential ordinary shares 2,017,744 2,039,292 Diluted weighted average shares 138,609,218 138,206,213 The normalised basic and normalised diluted earnings per share have been calculated in addition to the basic and diluted earnings per shares required by IAS 33, Earnings per Share since, in the opinion of the Directors, they reflect the underlying performance of the businesss operations more appropriately.

This finite life goodwill is subject to an annual impairment charge to reflect the finite nature of the cash flows related to this goodwill.
With respect to the recoverable amount of the UK Trains goodwill, the discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10.7% 2004: 10.7% and cash flows sourced from management plans through to the end of the franchise.
66 Notes to the Accounts 14 INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued Indefinite life intangible assets including goodwill have been allocated to individual cash generating units for annual impairment testing on the basis of the Groups business operations.
The carrying value of indefinite life intangible assets by cash generating unit is as follows: 2005 2004 m m UK Bus 13.2 UK Trains 19.2 52.5 UK Coach 5.6 5.7 North American Bus US School Bus 161.6 141.2 US Public Transit 92.9 Canadian School Bus 74.2 48.9 European Coach & Bus Alsa 425.5 699.3 341.2 The useful economic lives of contractual relationships in Canada are deemed to be indefinite due to the accepted market presumption that these contracts will be renewed indefinitely whilst the customer contract and rail franchise intangible assets are to be amortised over the finite duration of the contract or franchise as appropriate.
All amortisation charges in the year have been charged to operating costs.
The impairment charge in 2005 of 60.0m relates to our North American Public Transit operations that were sold on 1 September 2005 see note 11.
The impairment charge in 2004 of 10.6m relates entirely to Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd, and is included in the loss for that year from discontinued operations in relation to our Australian Bus operations see note 11.
The recoverable amount of indefinite life intangible assets has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three year period.
Growth has then been extrapolated forward from the end of the forecasts.
The assumptions used for the other cash generating units are as follows: Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond Discount rate applied to three year period of cash flow projections management plan 2005 2004 2005 2004 UK Bus 10.7% 5.0% North America US School Bus 10.8% 10.8% 2.0% 3.0% Canadian School Bus 12.1% 12.1% 2.0% 3.0% The discount rates represent the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital appropriate for the cash flow generated.
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the assumptions over gross margin, discount rates, price inflation, and growth rate.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each unit and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill arising on the Alsa acquisition, which completed on 1 December 2005, will be tested for impairment for the first time at 31 December 2006.
At 31 December 2005, the acquisition model used to support the acquisition was still appropriate for supporting the carrying value.
The carrying value of the intangible assets acquired in the Alsa acquisition will be finalised in the year ending 31 December 2006.
Any adjustment to the carrying value of the intangible assets will lead to a corresponding adjustment in goodwill.

In the opinion of the Directors, the Group is not in a position to exercise significant influence over the THL, URS and Alsa available for sale investments under the definitions in IAS 28, Investments in associates.
Although the Group holds more than 20% of the ordinary shares of LCR, it does not have a presence on the board and is not in a position to exert significant influence over this investment.
The Group is not in a position to exercise significant influence over PCL as its funding is entirely provided by the majority shareholder.
At 31 December 2005, the Directors are unable to revalue the unquoted equity instruments that form the investment in THL as a reliable valuation cannot be prepared due to the wide range of estimates available for the valuation.
Therefore the investment is measured at cost.

In particular, due to the proximity of the combination to the year end the Group has been unable to complete a detailed valuation of the intangible and tangible assets acquired with the business.
Accordingly, the surplus of consideration over fair value of the share of net assets 73 Notes to the Accounts 20 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSALS continued a Acquisition of Alsa continued acquired has been allocated to goodwill at 31 December 2005.
The Group expects to identify intangible assets, including brands, customer relationships and customer contracts, and will complete a property valuation.
Independent valuers have been retained by the Group to complete this exercise and the results will be reflected in the Groups next accounts.
The value of goodwill will be adjusted by a corresponding amount for the value of intangible assets identified and the difference between the market and book values of the property assets.
Management believes that goodwill remaining after this exercise will comprise value to the Group for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted and will represent future growth opportunities.
On 15 December 2005 the Group paid 12.7m of cash consideration to acquire the 10.2% minority interest of Enatcar, a subsidiary of Alsa.
This payment represented fair value and consequently had no impact on the goodwill recognised above.
Due to the date of acquisition, the profit accrued in 2005 was not material to the Group.
From the date of acquisition, Alsa has contributed 2.6m to the normalised operating profit of the Group.
As a privately owned group Alsa did not prepare consolidated financial information.
Using the December 2005 results as being indicative of the profit for the full year, if the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the normalised operating profit for the Group would have been 184.1m and revenue from continuing operations would have been 2,416.2m.
b Other acquisitions The Group acquired the entire share capital of TGM Buses Limited and TGM Middlesex Limited, representing the London bus operations of Tellings Golden Miller PLC TGM on 17 June 2005.
In Canada the Group acquired the entire share capital of Aboutown School Transit Inc. a school bus operator on 15 July 2005 and the entire share capital of Northstar Passenger Services LP and Walsh Transportation LP, representing the school bus operations of Contrans Income Fund a Canadian freight haulage company on 1 August 2005.
The Group also acquired the entire share capital of Jones School Bus Service Inc. on 10 November 2005, a school bus operator in the United States.

The adjustments represent: a the recognition of customer contracts acquired with the TGM business 4.5m, Aboutown 0.6m, Northstar 1.5m and Jones 6.3m : b customer relationships acquired with Aboutown 2.8m and Northstar 10.5m which reflects the presumption of indefinite renewal in relation to school bus contracts in Canada.
The customer contracts will be amortised over the life of the contracts, whilst customer relationships will not be amortised, but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis: c an increase in the value of property, plant and equipment at Jones following a review of the vehicle fleet: and d an increase in payables of 1.6m at TGM, 0.3m at Jones and 0.2m at Northstar.
74 Notes to the Accounts 20 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSALS continued b Other acquisitions continued Consideration was 21.3m for TGM including 0.3m acquisition costs, 4.1m for Aboutown, 26.2m for Northstar including 0.3m deferred consideration and 0.7m acquisition costs, and 15.5m for Jones including 1.6m deferred consideration and 0.2m acquisition costs.
From their respective dates of acquisition TGM, Aboutown, Northstar and Jones have contributed 0.8m, 0.2m, 0.7m and 0.2m respectively to normalised operating profit and a 0.1m loss, 0.1m loss, 0.2m profit and 0.2m loss to the net loss of the Group.
If these four combinations had taken place at the beginning of the year the normalised operating profit for the Group would have been 156.9m, loss for the Group would have been 1.7m, and revenue from continuing operations would have been 2,245.0m.
Included in the goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be separately identified and measured due to their nature.
This includes control over the acquired businesses and increased scale in our London Bus and Canadian school bus operations.
Management believes that goodwill represents value to the Group for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted.
The majority of the value was assessed to comprise of synergy benefits expected to be achieved by merging the businesses acquired into the Groups UK Bus and North American operations.
During the year ended 31 December 2004, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Connex Bus UK Limited now called Travel London Limited, a bus operator in the UK, the entire share capital of 1114448 Ontario Limited, the holding company of Student Express Limited, a school bus operator in Canada, and certain assets of M&O Bus Lines Handicab Limited, another school bus operator in Canada.

The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities which, if contravened, would result in its loans becoming immediately repayable.
These covenants specify maximum net debt to EBITDA, and minimum EBITDA to interest and EBITDA plus fixed charges to interest payable and fixed charges ratios.
82 Notes to the Accounts 31 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES Financial risk factors and management The Groups multi-national operations and significant debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most material of which are the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and changes in fuel prices.
The Group has in place a risk management program that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the group by using foreign currency financial instruments, including debt, fuel price and interest rate swaps.
The Board of Directors have delegated to a sub-committee, the Treasury committee, the responsibility for implementing the risk management policies laid down by the Board.
The policies are implemented by the central Treasury department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The Treasury department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
The Group does not hold any financial instruments that would be classified as held for trading under IAS 39.
Foreign currency The Group has major operations in the US, Canada and Spain.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risks primarily with respect to US dollars, Canadian dollars and the Euro in translation of net assets and on earnings denominated in foreign currency.
The Group finances overseas investments mainly through the use of foreign currency borrowings to hedge the net asset investment.
The Group has also entered into some forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure of its overseas subsidiaries.
These have the effect of increasing dollar or euro denominated debt and reducing sterling debt.
The forward exchange contract terms run for periods up to one year.
The Group has a policy of hedging between 50% and 100% foreign currency denominated net assets.
At 31 December 2005 61% of the Groups exposure to US Dollar assets were hedged, 94% of the exposure to Canadian Dollar assets, 99% of the exposure to Australian Dollar assets and 96% of the exposure to Euro assets.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures, and with the exception of fuel purchases we believe these exposures are immaterial.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
It is the Groups policy to maintain an appropriate balance between fixed and floating interest rates on borrowings in order to provide certainty as to the level of our interest expense in the short term and to reduce the year on year impact of interest rate fluctuations over the medium term.
Interest on the Groups debt is based on LIBOR or EURIBOR and, to achieve the above objectives, we have entered into a series of interest rate swaps that have the effect of converting floating debt to fixed debt.
The net effect of these transactions was that as at 31 December 2005 the Group was hedged against interest rate movements on 287.6m of gross debt for an average of 4.1 years.
Based on the year end debt, each 1% increase in interest rates would cost the Group approximately 2.8m.
Commodity prices The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of fuel usage.
It is our policy to hedge this exposure in order to provide certainty as to the level of costs in the short term and to reduced the year on year impact of price fluctuations over the medium term.
This is achieved by entering into fuel swaps and purchase contracts which are expected to be highly effective.
As at 31 December 2005 the Group had hedged approximately 95% of its 2006 expected usage, 18% of its 2007 expected usage and 14% of its 2008 usage.
Credit risk The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group is the gross carrying value of each of its financial assets as disclosed in note 32, and trade receivables as disclosed in note 23.
This risk is mitigated by a number of factors.
The majority of the Groups receivables are with public or quasipublic bodies, both national the SRA DfT Rail and Network Rail in the UK and local school boards and city councils in North America, municipal authorities in Spain, Portugal and Morocco, Transport for London and Centro in the UK.
The Group does not consider these counterparties to be a significant credit risk.
Outside of this the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
Financial instrument counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Treasury committee and such approval is limited to financial institutions with an A rating or better.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit, which is reassessed annually by the Treasury committee.
Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure the group has sufficient available funds to meet current and forecast financial requirements as cost effectively as possible.
As at 31 December 2005 the Group had committed credit facilities of 841m of which 63.7m were undrawn.
The Groups loan facilities expire in October 2006 and November 2009, and the lease facilities at various times in line with their terms.

In accordance with IAS 39, the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for.
The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, fuel price and interest rate swaps has been determined by the third party financial institution with whom the Group holds the instrument, in line with the market value of similar financial instruments.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by maturity of the Groups financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk.
1 year 1- 2 years 2- 3 years 3- 4 years 4- 5 years 5 years Total As at 31 December 2005 m m m m m m m Fixed rate Other debt receivable 1.0 1.0 Bank loans 150.1 58.1 208.2 Finance leases 13.6 10.2 8.3 8.5 8.9 29.9 79.4 Interest rate swaps 4.1 8.3 12.4 Floating rate Cash assets 145.5 145.5 Bank overdrafts 5.5 5.5 Loan notes 0.8 0.8 Bank loans 34.4 351.9 386.3 Finance leases 10.0 12.7 2.5 2.0 1.0 1.5 29.7 84 Notes to the Accounts 32 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Hedging activities Interest hedges The Group has a number of interest rate swaps in place to hedge both the cash flow and fair value risk in relation to interest rate.
a Cash flow hedges with a total principal of US$200m that were entered into in September 2000 fixed at 6.9% and 6.8545% for US$100m each until September 2010.
Of this amount US$100m meets the criteria for hedge accounting and US$100m does not.
b Fair value hedges with a principal of US$100m were entered into in March 2004.
These had the effect of fixing the accrued loss of US$18.3m on US$100m cash flow hedges fixed at 6.9% entered into in September 2000, but do not qualify for hedge accounting under the rules of IAS 39.
The net effect of the two 6.9% hedges is immaterial in the income statement.
c An interest rate swap with a principal of US$200m fixed at 6.25%, but including an embedded option that means the interest payment will revert to LIBOR should LIBOR exceed 7% was in place at 1 January 2005.
This interest rate swap was settled in January 2005 and did not meet the definition of a cash flow hedge under IAS 39.
This resulted in a 0.1m credit being recognised in the income statement.
d Cash flow hedges with a principal of 200m that were entered into in December 2005 fixed at 2.84% until December 2007.
The reset dates of all swaps remaining in place at 31 December 2005 coincide with the material conditions of the underlying loans.
The benchmark rate for floating rate financial liabilities is the relevant interbank borrowing rate.
During the year 3.5m has been transferred from the hedging reserve to the income statement in respect of interest rate swaps.
Hedge of net investments in foreign entities Included in bank loans are borrowings of US$280m 162.7m, CAN$70m 35.0m and 545m 374.9m which have been designated as a hedge of net investments in the foreign currency denominated net assets of the Group and is being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk.
In addition the Group has synthetic debt in the form of foreign currency forward contracts in place split between US$nil, CAN$156.7m 78.3m, AUD$80m 34.1m and 160m 110.1m to complete the post-tax hedge of the net investment in foreign entities.
The portion of the gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contracts that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and, to this extent, offsets any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
Fuel price hedges The Group has a number of fuel price swaps in place to hedge the different types of fuel used in each division.
Ultra low sulphur diesel and gasoil as used in the UK Bus, UK Coach, UK Trains and European Coach & Bus Alsa divisions is hedged by swaps in the same type of fuel.
Diesel used in the North American division is hedged by heating oil swaps which have been determined to be effective hedges of the fuel used with a strong correlation in price movements between the two products.
During the year 12.9m has been transferred from the hedging reserve, of which 4.9m was recognised in the hedging reserve at 1 January 2005 and the remainder was generated during the year due to the movement in market fuel prices.
Fuel price swaps can be analysed as follows: 31 December 1 January 31 December 1 January 2005 2005 2005 2005 Volume Volume m m Million litres Million litres Sterling denominated fuel swaps UK Bus, UK Coach and UK Trains 0.6 3.0 118.5 66.0 US Dollar denominated fuel swaps North American Bus 5.7 1.9 42.2 41.6 Euro denominated fuel swaps European Coach & Bus Alsa 0.4 42.0 Fuel price swaps included in current assets 6.7 4.9 202.7 107.6 Sterling denominated fuel swaps UK Bus, UK Coach and UK Trains 0.6 59.0 US Dollar denominated fuel swaps North American Bus 1.4 37.8 Fuel price swaps included in non-current assets 0.6 1.4 59.0 37.8 Total fuel price swaps 7.3 6.3 261.7 145.4 85 Notes to the Accounts 32 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Fuel price hedges continued Foreign currency Interest forward rate swaps contracts Fuel swaps Total 2005 m m m m Liability asset at 1 January 27.5 14.9 6.3 6.3 Closed out during year 11.9 11.9 Cash paid received in relation to hedging instruments taken to income statement 3.5 12.9 9.4 Revaluation 1.3 0.1 13.3 14.5 Exchange differences 1.6 24.1 0.6 25.1 Liability asset at 31 December 12.4 9.3 7.3 14.4 2004 Disclosures The following comparatives are disclosed in compliance with FRS 13, Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures as applied by the Group under UK GAAP for 2004.

a Interest rate risk and currency profile of financial liabilities After taking into account interest rate swaps, the interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 was as follows: Weighted Financial Weighted Weighted average period Borrowings Borrowings liabilities on average average until maturity at at which no fixed period for for financial floating fixed Total interest is interest which liabilities on which rates rates borrowings paid Total rate rate is fixed no interest is paid 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 m m m m m % Years Years Sterling 44.9 11.2 56.1 17.7 73.8 5.1 2.8 1.5 US dollars 51.1 173.9 225.0 2.1 227.1 6.9 4.8 3.5 Australian dollars 2.7 2.7 0.3 3.0 7.6 1.2 1.5 Canadian dollars 1.0 1.0 1.0 97.0 187.8 284.8 20.1 304.9 6.8 4.6 1.9 Included within the US dollar fixed rate financial liabilities is an interest rate swap for 104.2m US$200m, fixed at 6.25% until 8 January 2009, which will revert to a floating rate should the US dollar six month LIBOR exceed 7%.
The benchmark rate for floating rate financial liabilities is the LIBOR of the relevant currency.
This swap was terminated in January 2005.
Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid comprise other creditors of 3.1m falling due after more than one year, provisions falling due after more than one year of 6.2m, and interests in provisions of associates of 10.8m.

36 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS a Summary of pension benefits and assumptions The UK Bus and UK Coach divisions operate both funded defined benefit schemes and a defined contribution scheme.
The majority of employees of the UK Train companies are members of the appropriate shared-cost section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.
The assets of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Contributions to the schemes are determined by independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Subsidiaries in North America contribute to a number of defined contribution plans.
The Group also provides certain additional post-employment benefits to employees in North America and Spain, which are disclosed in section iii in the Other category.
The total pension cost for the year was 27.5m 2004: 31.6m, of which 2.5m 2004: 3.4m relates to the defined contribution schemes.
The defined benefit pension liability included in the balance sheet is as follows: 2005 2004 m m UK Bus 37.8 36.2 UK Coach 14.9 11.0 UK Train 34.2 17.9 Other 1.9 0.6 Total 88.8 65.7 The valuations conducted for financial reporting purposes are based on the triennial actuarial valuations.
A summary of the latest triennial actuarial valuations, and assumptions made, is as follows: UK Bus UK Coach UK Trains Travel West Tayside Midlands 31 March 31 March 5 April 31 December Date of actuarial valuation 2002 2004 2004 2004 Actuarial method used Projected unit Attained age Projected unit Projected unit Rate of investment returns per annum 5.4% 5.6%-6.6% 5.2%-6.0% 4.8%-6.8% Increase in earnings per annum 4.1% 4.3% 4.7% 4.3% Scheme assets taken at market value 36.2m 300.7m 25.3m 638.9m Funding level 107% 88% 65% 86%-95% Amounts included in the income statement, statement of recognised income and expense and the balance sheet are calculated using the projected unit method.
The range of funding levels for UK Trains reflects the range of funding levels in the various sections of the RPS.
The plans do not provide medical benefits.
90 Notes to the Accounts 36 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS continued a Summary of pension benefits and assumptions continued The most recent triennial valuations are then updated by independent professionally qualified actuaries for financial reporting purposes, in accordance with IAS 19.
For the RPS, mortality assumptions are based on the recent experience of the Scheme with an allowance for future improvements in mortality.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The expected rate of return on assets is determined based on the market prices prevailing on that date.
b Accounting for the Railways Pension Scheme The majority of employees of the UK Train companies are members of the appropriate section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.
The RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% employer and 40% employee.
To date, the Group has experienced three changes of UK Train franchise ownership where the current owner has funded the scheme during the franchise term and the pension deficit at franchise exit has transferred to the new owner, without cash settlement.
However, although the Groups past experience has proven otherwise, our legal advice has opined that in certain situations, some of the liability for the deficit on the relevant sections of the RPS could theoretically crystallise for funding by an individual TOC at the end of the franchise.
By entering into the franchise contract, the TOC becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the rules of the RPS must fund its share of the pension liability in accordance with the schedule of contributions agreed with the Scheme trustees and actuaries and for which there is no funding cap set out in the franchise contract.
We understand that franchise contracts entered into in the future will clarify that RPS pension deficits and surpluses will not be the responsibility of the outgoing franchisee following exit.
To comply with IAS 19, the Group is required to account for its legal obligation under the formal terms of the RPS and its constructive obligation that arises under the terms of each franchise agreement.
In determining the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the Groups accounts present fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows, management has consulted with TOC industry peers and has concluded that the Groups constructive but not its legal RPS defined benefit obligations should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.
This accounting policy, which in all other respects is consistent with that set out in this note for the Groups other defined benefit schemes, means that the Groups accounts reflect that element of the deficits anticipated to be settled by the Group during the franchise term and will prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new owner at franchise exit.
In calculating the Groups constructive obligations in respect of the RPS, the Group has calculated the total pension deficits in each of the RPS sections in accordance with IAS 19 and the assumptions set out above.
These deficits are reduced by a franchise adjustment which is that portion of the deficit projected to exist at the end of the franchise and for which the Group will not be required to fund.
The franchise adjustment, which has been calculated by the Groups actuaries, is offset against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the financial performance, position and cash flows of the Groups obligations.
91 Notes to the Accounts 36 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS continued b Accounting for the Railways Pension Scheme continued The franchise adjustment increased from 67.6m at 31 December 2004 to 71.0m at 31 December 2005.
The increase is caused by the interest on the franchise adjustment 3.6m offset by net actuarial movements in scheme liabilities of 0.2m.
In the prior year, the franchise adjustment increased by 5.2m from 62.4m at 1 January 2004 to 67.6m at 31 December 2004.
The increase was caused by unwinding the discounting 3.3m and net actuarial movements in scheme liabilities 28.1m, offset by franchise exits net of franchise wins extensions 26.2m.
If the Group had accounted for its legal obligation in respect of the RPS instead of the constructive obligation, the following adjustments would have been made to the financial information: 2005 2004 m m Balance Sheet Defined benefit pension deficit 71.0 67.6 Deferred tax asset 20.1 19.5 Intangible asset 3.4 2.3 47.5 45.8 Statement of recognised income and expense Actuarial gains losses 0.2 28.1 Tax on actuarial gains and losses 0.3 9.0 0.5 19.1 Income Statement Financing cost unwind of discount 3.6 3.3 Curtailment gain on franchise exit 28.6 Intangible asset amortisation 1.1 0.8 Deferred tax credit charge 0.3 8.7 2.2 17.4 c Financial results for pension benefits The amounts charged to the Group income statement and Group statement of recognised income and expense for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2004 are set out in the following tables.

The Groups date of transition to IFRS is 1 January 2004 and all comparative information in the accounts is restated to reflect the Groups adoption of IFRS, except where otherwise required or permitted under IFRS 1.
IFRS 1 requires an entity to comply with each IFRS effective at the reporting date for its first IFRS accounts.
As a general principle, IFRS 1 requires the standards effective at the reporting date to be applied retrospectively.
However, retrospective application is prohibited in some areas, particularly where retrospective application would require judgements by management about past conditions after the outcome of the particular transaction is already known.
A number of optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRSs are granted where the cost of compliance is deemed to exceed the benefits to users of the accounts.
The Group has taken the following exemptions: IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, have been adopted from 1 January 2005, with no restatement of comparative information.
Business combinations prior to 1 January 2004 have not been restated to comply with IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
Cumulative translation differences on foreign currency denominated operations are deemed to be nil at 1 January 2004.
Any gains and losses recognised in the income statement on subsequent disposals of foreign operations will therefore exclude translation differences arising prior to the transition date.
Share-based payment charges will only be recognised for those awards granted after 7 November 2002 which have not vested as of 1 January 2005.
Where applicable, the options selected by management are set out in more detail in the explanatory notes below.
IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment IFRS 2 requires the Group to recognise an expense for employees and directors share options and other share based incentives by using an optionpricing model.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 in respect of equity settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 January 2005.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and IAS 38 Intangible Assets IFRS 3 has been applied to the accounting for business combinations from 1 January 2004, as permitted by IFRS 1.
The adoption of IFRS 3 and IAS 36 has resulted in the cessation of annual goodwill amortisation and the adoption of annual impairment reviews at the cash generating unit level from 1 January 2004.
Intangible assets are now recognised upon acquisition at the individual asset category level.
They have either a finite or indefinite life, and therefore are amortised or reviewed annually for impairment as appropriate.
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations The Group previously presented the operating results of operations discontinued during the year separately from the exceptional profit or loss on disposal.
The adoption of IFRS 5 means that the Groups interest in discontinued operations is presented after continuing operations and represents the post-tax results of operations after interest and the post-tax gain or loss on disposal.
Any assets or liabilities remaining in the balance sheet at the period end relating to discontinued operations will be presented separately from the assets and liabilities of continuing operations.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits The Group previously recognised pension costs on a systematic basis so that the costs of providing retirement benefits to employees were evenly matched, so far as was possible, to the service lives of the employees concerned.
Any surplus or deficit of the actuarial value of assets over the actuarial value of liabilities of the pension scheme was spread over the average remaining service lives of employees.
In addition disclosures were made in accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 17, Retirement Benefits.
The effect of adopting IAS 19 has been to recognise a pension liability to reflect the Groups obligations to fund its defined benefit pension plans.
Additionally the adoption of the standard has resulted in various changes in the income statement and the creation of offsetting intangible assets for some of the deficits existing in certain of the Groups TOCs that existed when those contracts were commenced.
Details of the accounting for the Railways Pension Scheme are given in section ii of note 36.
101 Notes to the Accounts 40 RECONCILIATION OF NET ASSETS, PROFIT AND CASH FLOW UNDER UK GAAP TO IFRS continued a First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 and has not restated its results for the year ended 31 December 2004 for the effect of IAS 32 or IAS 39.
The main adjustments that would be required to make the prior period results comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39 would involve including the Groups derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet, and accounting for changes in fair value in accordance with the hedging rules of IAS 39 through the income statement.
The adoption of IAS 39 has resulted in additional financial instruments being recognised on the Groups balance sheet from 1 January 2005, principally derivative instruments used by the Group to hedge financial risks.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value, and the hedging rules of the standard have been applied so that movements have been taken directly to the income statement or to equity depending on the nature of the hedging relationship and its effectiveness.
The stricter designation documentation requirements and effectiveness testing needed to qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS compared to UK GAAP means that, in certain circumstances, transactions undertaken as hedges under UK GAAP do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS.
However, the Groups strategy is unchanged in respect of the hedging of the net investment position of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, certain fuel usage and interest rate variances that the Group has previously hedged.
The Group has adopted the full version of IAS 39 as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
For the Group, compliance with the full version of IAS 39 will also achieve compliance with the European Commission endorsed version of IAS 39.
IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date Under IAS 10 the liability in respect of dividend payments is recognised when the dividend is approved.
On this basis dividends approved after the balance sheet date are not recorded as a liability at that balance sheet date.
IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment In previous years certain land and buildings were carried at fair value, based on valuations by external independent valuers, less subsequent depreciation for buildings.
The last valuation was at 31 December 1995.
The Group will not revalue properties in the future and will use the depreciated cost method under IAS 16.
Under the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1 the Group has elected to deem the fair value of these revalued assets to be equivalent to cost and will adopt the cost model for depreciation in the future.
IAS 17 Leases Since June 2005 the Group has identified a number of long-leasehold properties that require reclassification to non-current prepayments under IAS 17.
This reclassification has no impact on net assets and no impact on the income statement.
IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates The Group will continue to translate the results of foreign currency denominated operations at average exchange rates and the balance sheets at period end exchange rates.
Under IAS 21 the Group will be required to separately identify translation differences for each foreign currency denominated operation.
Any translation differences arising under IFRS will be separately recorded in equity, net of any foreign exchange movements on related hedging instruments.
On disposal of a foreign currency denominated operation, the cumulative translation differences for that operation are transferred to the consolidated income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
This was not the case under previous accounting policies.
The Group will take advantage of the election under IFRS 1 not to record cumulative translation differences arising before the transition date and all subsequent disposals shall exclude any translation differences prior to 1 January 2004.

See note 11 for additional disclosures of the results from discontinued operations.
b Operating costs have been reduced by 205.8m comprising 204.9m of costs from discontinued operations reclassified in the income statement see note 11 for details and a 1.5m credit following the adoption of IAS 19 in respect of defined benefit pension schemes.
Off-setting these reductions is a 0.6m charge recognised in respect of share-based payments.
c Goodwill amortisation is reduced by 28.9m by the IFRS 3 requirement not to amortise goodwill with a presumed indefinite life 18.3m and by the reallocation of the goodwill impairment on discontinued operations 10.6m under IFRS 5 see note 11. d The property, plant and equipment impairment charge of 6.1m, 0.2m of the charge for exceptional items, 0.8m profit on disposal of noncurrent assets, 8.9m profit on the sale of discontinued operations and 0.4m of net finance costs are reclassified to results from discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 see note 11. e Intangible asset amortisation of 2.4m is charged on the intangible asset 1.9m created upon the recognition of the UK Trains pension scheme deficit under IAS 19 see note 36 and on the customer contract and relationship assets 0.5m acquired with certain Canadian school bus acquisitions in 2004. f The change in accounting policies does not alter the current tax charge for 2004.
The charge for deferred tax increased by 0.5m.
The deferred tax impact of IFRS 3 has given rise to a 1.3m charge on goodwill on certain US acquisitions which remains deductible for tax purposes.
Additionally the continuing group charge has increased by 1.5m as credits have been reallocated to discontinued operations see note 11.
Offsetting this, the deferred tax impact of the change in the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes under IAS 19 has given rise to a 2.3m tax credit.

Offsetting this, an additional charge of 0.1m has been recognised for share-based payments under IFRS 2. c UK Coach benefited from a 0.9m reduction in pension charges following the adoption of IAS 19. d North American Bus incurred additional charges of 0.2m, recognised in respect of holiday pay under IAS 19 0.1m and share-based payments under IFRS 2 0.1m.
e The result for Central Functions was unchanged as the 0.3m charge recognised in respect of share-based payments was offset by a 0.3m reduction in pension charges under IAS 19. f The 9.6m normalised operating profit for discontinued operations, the 6.1m property, plant and equipment impairment charge and 0.2m of the charge for exceptional items are reclassified in the income statement in accordance with IFRS 5. g Goodwill amortisation is reduced by 28.9m by the IFRS 3 requirement not to amortise goodwill with a presumed indefinite life 18.3m and by the reallocation of the goodwill impairment on discontinued operations 10.6m under IFRS 5 see note 11. h Intangible asset amortisation of 2.4m is charged on the intangible asset 1.9m created upon the recognition of the UK Trains pension scheme deficit under IAS 19 see note 36 and on the customer contract and relationship assets 0.5m acquired with certain Canadian school bus acquisitions in 2004.

Goodwill is increased by 14.3m 1 January 2004: nil on transition to IFRS.
The presumption of indefinite life for goodwill under IFRS 3 reduces the amortisation charge for 2004 and therefore increases the book value at 31 December 2004 by 17.8m.
Offsetting this, 3.5m has been reclassified to intangible assets representing customer contracts and contractual relationships recognised on the acquisition of certain Canadian school bus operations in 2004.
Intangible assets increase by 14.1m 1 January 2004: 1.0m as a number of intangible assets have been created and amortised during 2004.
An 11.1m 1 January 2004: 1.0m intangible asset related to the recognition of the defined benefit pension scheme deficit under IAS 19 has been recognised in addition to 3.0m 1 January 2004: nil, representing customer contracts and contractual relationships acquired in 2004 transferred from goodwill.
b Property, plant and equipment is reduced by 46.8m at 31 December 2004 1 January 2004: 32.5m for three reasons.
Long leasehold property with a net book value of 21.4m 1 January 2004: 23.4m is reallocated from property, plant and equipment to non-current other receivables under IAS 17.
Property, plant and equipment in the Groups discontinued operations of 25.4m 1 January 2004: nil is transferred to disposal group assets under IFRS 5.
Finally, 9.1m of property is reclassified as investment properties at 1 January 2004 under IAS 40.
The property in question was disposed of during 2004. c The investment in associates of 0.3m 1 January 2004: 0.3m is reclassified from investments to amounts due to associates.
d Other receivables increase by 30.5m 1 January 2004: 26.9m because of 14.0m 1 January 2004: 8.7m reallocated from current assets to non-current assets under IAS 1 and 21.4m 1 January 2004: 23.4m reallocated from property, plant and equipment under IAS 17.
This is offset by a 4.9m 1 January 2004: 5.2m reduction in pension prepayments at UK Bus and UK Coach following the transition to IAS 19. e IAS 12 only permits deferred tax balances to be netted off if they occur in the same tax jurisdiction.
This has resulted in a deferred tax asset of 18.3m 1 January 2004: 12.0m and a deferred tax liability of 4.5m 1 January 2004: 2.7m.
The adoption of IAS 19 has created a deferred tax asset of 18.0m 1 January 2004: 15.9m in relation to both pensions and holiday pay adjustments.
The effect of IFRS 3 on goodwill amortisation has created a 1.3m deferred tax liability 1 January 2004: nil and IFRS 2 has given rise to a 1.0m 1 January 2004: 0.2m asset.
f A number of adjustments are required under IFRS 5 to reclassify assets and liabilities to the disposal group categories in the balance sheet.
