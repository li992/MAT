Finance and operating leases Where the Company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is the shorter.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included in creditors.
Rentals are apportioned on a sum of digits basis, between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases and the rental charges are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
