Tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided at the anticipated tax rates on timing differences arising from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Group has adopted the policy of discounting deferred tax balances as permitted by FRS 19.
The discount rates used reflect the posttax yields to maturity that can be obtained on government bonds with similar maturity dates and currencies to those of the deferred tax assets or liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
K. Leases Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the leases and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

Ernst & Young are assisting Freshfields in the investigation, reporting to the Chairman of the Compass Group PLC Audit Committee.
On 3 November, the Group announced that the investigation raised serious concerns as to whether, within ESS, there has been in connection with IHC and the UN, improper conduct and a failure to comply with the Groups statement of business principles which apply to all staff, whatever their seniority.
As a result, 3 employees have been dismissed.
The investigation is ongoing and, as yet, no final conclusions have been reached.
The Group will continue to co-operate voluntarily and fully as appropriate with the UN and US authorities, including the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
UN contracts account for less than 0.5% of the Groups turnover and profits.
No provision has been made in these financial statements in respect of these matters and it is not currently possible to quantify any potential liability which may arise.
The directors currently have no reason to believe that any potential liability that may arise would be material to the financial position of the Group.
The Group, through a number of its subsidiary undertakings, is from time to time party to various other legal proceedings or claims arising from its normal business.
Provision is made as appropriate.
None of these proceedings is regarded as material litigation.
