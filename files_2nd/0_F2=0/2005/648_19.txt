Pension costs Defined contribution pension schemes The Company operates the McAlpine 2003 Pension Plan which is a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all qualifying employees.

The most recent full actuarial valuation of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations was carried out at 31 December 2002 by Mercer Human Resource Consulting and was updated to 31 December 2005.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service costs and past service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method.
In calculating the liabilities the following assumptions have been used: At At 31 12 05 31 12 04 %pa %pa Discount rate 4.9 5.4 Salary growth 3.5 3.6 RPI 2.5 2.6 Expected return on scheme assets 6.0 6.3 Increases to pensions in payment 2.5 2.6 Deferred pensions are revalued to retirement age in line with the RPI assumptions unless otherwise prescribed by statutory requirements or the rules of the schemes.
Amounts recognised in income in respect of the Plan are as follows: 2005 2004 m m Current service cost 0.1 Interest cost 15.4 15.7 Expected return on scheme assets 13.4 13.0 Past service cost 0.1 2.1 2.8 Of the charge for the year, current and past service cost have been included in administrative expenses and interest costs net of expected returns on scheme assets have been included in finance costs.

Reserves Share Other EBT Profit and premium reserves reserve loss account m m m m At 31 December 2004 as previously reported 87.4 188.6 88.0 Impact on opening reserves of adopting new standards Prior year adjustment FRS 20 Share-based Payment: reclassification of reserves 1.4 1.4 prior year adjustment 0.7 Prior year adjustment FRS 17 Retirement Benefits 67.3 Prior year adjustment FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date 7.0 At 31 December 2004 as restated 87.4 188.6 1.4 28.4 Profit for the year 10.3 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year 12.4 2.1 Share-based payment 0.2 1.0 Actuarial gain on pension scheme 24.9 Movement on deferred tax relating to pension liability 7.5 Shares issued 1.8 At 31 December 2005 89.2 188.6 1.2 44.7 Prior year adjustments These have arisen as a result of the Company adopting new standards that have become applicable in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005, as follows: The Company has adopted FRS 20 Share-based Payment which requires the fair value of the liability for the cash settled elements of share-based payments to be accrued on the balance sheet.
The effect of this was to increase trade and other payables by 1.0m and to reduce net assets by 0.7m.
The Company has also adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benefits in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme.
The balance sheet impact of this standard was to recognise a pension liability of 63.9m in the Companys balance sheet as at 1 January 2005 in place of the 32.3m SSAP 24 net prepayment.
Net of the deferred tax associated with both these balances, the impact was to reduce net assets by 67.3m.
The effect of adopting FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date has been to remove at 1 January 2005, the provision in respect of the final proposed dividend for 2004 of 7.0m, because at the balance sheet date it was still subject to approval and would therefore not have been an adjusting event.
The results for the year ended 31 December 2004 have been restated for the above changes where relevant, and the impact has been to decrease the previously reported retained profit by 68.6m in respect of the FRS 17 adjustment and to increase it by 6.4m in respect of FRS 21.
