15 Financial Instruments i Management of Risk As an investment trust, the Groups investment objective is to seek capital growth from a portfolio of securities drawn from markets both within the UK and worldwide.
The holding of these financial instruments to meet this objective results in certain risks.
The Groups financial instruments comprise: 1.
Securities in unquoted and quoted companies, and partnership interests which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objective set out in the Investment Managers Review on pages 14 to 17.
A loan facility, the purpose of which is to finance tender offers, other share buy-backs and on-market purchases of shares, the financing of new investment and refinancing existing debt.
Investments are held with a view to identifying suitable opportunities for realisation.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review and the preceding year.
Market Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements, mitigated by stock selection.
The Group does not use derivatives.
The Board meets on a number of occasions during each year to consider the realisation programme of the investment portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular sectors.
Electra Partners has responsibility for monitoring the realisation programme of the portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through retained profits including both realised and unrealised capital profits.
In addition, financing is obtained through loan facilities.
During the year, long-term multi-currency loan facilities were in existence.
The initial drawdown under the loan facilities was in US Dollars and Euros.
The loans have a floating rate of interest.
The cash balances held on deposit mitigate in part the interest rate risk.
The resultant proceeds will be held as cash or short-term securities and used towards the repayment of the facility.
Interest rate risk profiles for financial assets and liabilities are shown in part iii of this Note.
These profiles exclude short term debtors and creditors.
Liquidity Risk The Groups assets comprise listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities.
There have been disposals in the period of both listed and unlisted investments, which have been used to repay loan facilities.
As a result the Groups liquidity has increased marginally during the year.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the revolving loan facility.
The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out in part iv of this Note.
50 Electra Investment Trust PLC Accounts Accounts Notes to the Accounts Foreign Currency Risk The Groups total return and net assets are affected by currency translation movements as a significant proportion of the investments held in the year are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
Revenue received in currencies other than sterling is converted into sterling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate.
The treatment of foreign currency transactions has been described in greater detail in the accounting policies note on page 43.
The foreign investments held are principally in the USA, Continental Europe, Latin America and the Far East.
During the year, the Group held loans denominated in US Dollars, Euros and Sterling, which partially offset exchange risks suffered during the current and previous years on foreign fixed asset investments.
Foreign currency exposures are analysed in part ii of this Note.
ii Foreign Currency Exposures A portion of the financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group are denominated in currencies other than sterling, which will have an impact on the net assets and return of the Group as at 30 September 2005.

The Company has undertaken to make further investments through various limited partnership funds in the UK and Continental Europe amounting to 66,636,000 2004: 1,893,000.
At 30 September 2005 the Company had uncalled commitments of 3,257,000 to a limited partnership fund managed by Electra Partners 2004: 3,742,000.
As a limited partner in a number of limited partnership funds, the Company has entered into agreements with subsidiaries of Electra Partners for the management of the Companys portfolio of investments.
In consideration for this the limited partnership funds pay a priority profit share to their general partners.
The management agreements are rolling contracts which now allow for termination by either party at the conclusion of a one year notice period.
A Group undertaking is the subject of HM Revenue & Customs enquiry in relation to certain prior year transactions.
Whilst the matters under enquiry could result in a material adjustment to the Groups overall taxation charge, it is the Directors belief that the taxation consequences of the transactions would not be material to the Groups net asset value and have been fairly stated in the Groups financial statements.
