The Groups financial assets and liabilities are as disclosed below.
The Groups financial assets comprise cash at bank, trade receivables and other receivables.
The Groups financial liabilities comprise bank and other borrowings, finance lease obligations, land payables, licenced land agreements, trade payables and other payables.
Derivative financial instruments The funding activities of the Group expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group utilises both interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to hedge the exposure to variability in cash ows associated with liabilities arising from highly probable forecast transactions.
These are entered into exclusively in relation to the US Dollar denominated senior loan notes, which are retranslated to their fair value at each period end.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ows are recognised directly in equity.
Amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.

74 Persimmon Plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the financial statements 10549 R&A 2005 Back 20 3 06 11:57 Page 75 26 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES In the normal course of business the Group has given counter indemnities in respect of performance bonds and financial guarantees.
The Group makes payments when entering into licence agreements for the right to build and sell houses on land owned by third parties.
Upon legal completion, the house purchaser makes a land payment to the third party and the balance of the sales proceeds is paid to the Group.
In some instances the Group has guaranteed certain land payments at appropriate dates, the payment of which is contingent upon the build programme not progressing according to plan.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of subsidiary undertakings the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
27 OPERATING LEASES At 31 December total outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases were as follows: 2005 2004 Group m m Expiring within one year 1.0 1.0 Expiring in the second to fifth years inclusive 4.8 6.0 Expiring after five years 18.9 19.5 24.7 26.5 Company Expiring within one year 0.1 0.3 Expiring in the second to fifth years inclusive 0.4 0.3 Expiring after five years 0.1 0.5 0.7 28 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Retirement benefit obligation At 31 December 2005 the Group had two employee pension schemes.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with IAS 19 Revised.
All pension scheme costs are recognised in the income statement and are reported as operating expenses.
Expected costs in relation to current employees are charged to the relevant operating business.
All other pension scheme costs are borne by the Company.
Persimmon Group Stakeholder Scheme The Persimmon Group Stakeholder Scheme is available to new salaried employees.
The Group matches employees own contributions to their individual Stakeholder plans, up to 7% of pensionable salary.
Group contributions to this scheme of 0.7m 2004: 0.4m are expensed through the income statement as incurred.
Persimmon Plc Pension & Life Assurance Scheme The Persimmon Plc Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme is a dened benefit scheme which was closed to new members on 30 September 2001.
The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2005 by a professionally qualied actuary and adopted the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method the current service cost, as a percentage of Scheme members pensionable pay, will increase as the active members of the Scheme approach retirement.
Standard 1992 mortality tables, appropriately adjusted, have been used as a basis to calculate the future liability.
From 1 July 2005, employer contributions into the Scheme were increased with the aim of repairing the past service deficit over a ten year period.
In addition, the Group introduced a salary sacrifice arrangement to further support the funding of the Scheme.

In accordance with IFRS 2, only costs relating to options issued after 7 November 2002 and not vested at 1 January 2004 have been charged to the income statement.
The Group also operates a long-term incentive plan LTIP, which results in share-based payment.
Vesting of the LTIP options is dependent upon return on capital employed and total shareholder return of the Group against a number of relevant comparator companies, as detailed on page 38.
These conditions have been factored into the option valuation applied.
Share options are issued to senior management, including the executive Directors, and also regional management of the operating business and divisions.
Vesting of share option awards is dependent on growth in earnings per share.
The Group also provides a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme open to all employees, which can be exercised three years after the date of grant, subject to compliance with HMRC restrictions.
Share options have been valued by an external third party using the binomial option-pricing model, based on publicly available market data at the time of grant, which the Directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.
