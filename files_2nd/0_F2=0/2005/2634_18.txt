Notes to the Group financial statements 1 GENERAl INFORmATION Burren Energy plc is a company incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and in the Review of Operations and the Financial Review on pages 10 to 17.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars for the first time because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IAS 21 revised The effects of changes in Foreign Exchange Rates IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease IFRIC 5 Right to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when IFRS 7 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POlICIES a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, for the first time.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 32.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historic cost basis except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial information of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill, any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group records any fair value uplift on piecemeal acquisition of a subsidiary within the relevant fixed asset caption, with the related balance being transferred to a revaluation reserve.
Where depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges are increased following such a fair value uplift, an amount equal to the increase is transferred annually from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings as a movement in equity.
c Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
40 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POlICIES continued d Oil and gas assets: exploration and evaluation The Group applies the full cost method of accounting for Exploration and Evaluation E&E costs, having regard to the requirements of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources, which it adopted early, from the date of transition to IFRS.
Under the full cost method of accounting, costs of exploring for and evaluating oil and gas properties are accumulated and capitalised by reference to appropriate cost pools.
Such cost pools are based on geographic areas and are not larger than a segment.
The Group currently has four cost pools: the Caspian, West Africa, the Middle East and India.
E&E costs are initially capitalised within Intangible assets other than goodwill.
Such E&E costs may include costs of licence acquisition, technical services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploration drilling and testing, but do not include costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area, which are expensed directly to the income statement as they are incurred.
Tangible assets acquired for use in E&E activities are classified as property, plant and equipment.
However, to the extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset.
Intangible E&E assets related to each exploration licence prospect are not depreciated and are carried forward until the existence or otherwise of commercial reserves has been determined.
The Groups definition of commercial reserves for such purpose is proven and probable reserves on an entitlement basis.
If commercial reserves have been discovered, the related E&E assets are assessed for impairment on a cost pool basis as set out below and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets is then reclassified as development and production assets within property, plant and equipment.
Intangible E&E assets that relate to E&E activities that are determined not to have resulted in the discovery of commercial reserves remain capitalised as intangible E&E assets at cost less accumulated amortisation, subject to meeting a pool-wide impairment test as set out below.
Such E&E assets are amortised on a unit of production basis over the life of the commercial reserves of the pool to which they relate.
E&E assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount.
Such indicators include the point at which a determination is made as to whether or not commercial reserves exist.
Where the E&E assets concerned fall within the scope of an established full cost pool, the E&E assets are tested for impairment together with all development and production assets associated with that cost pool, as a single cash generating unit.
The aggregate carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the pool, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves.
Where the E&E assets to be tested fall outside the scope of any established cost pool, there will generally be no commercial reserves and the E&E assets concerned will generally be written off in full.
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement as additional depreciation and separately disclosed.
e Oil and gas assets: development and production Development and production assets are accumulated on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets as outlined above.
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production method by reference to the ratio of production in the period to the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account estimated future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The aggregate carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the cash generating unit, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves.
The cash generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
f Decommissioning Where a material liability for the removal of production facilities and site restoration at the end of the productive life of a field exists, a provision for decommissioning is recognised.
The amount recognised is the present value of estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements.
A tangible fixed asset of an amount equivalent to the provision is also created and depreciated on a unit of production basis.
Changes in estimates are recognised prospectively, with corresponding adjustments to the provision and the associated fixed asset.
41 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POlICIES continued g Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line basis over their useful lives as follows: Plant and equipment 4 years Office furniture 4 years Barges and tugs 20 years h Oil and gas overlift and underlift Underlifts of entitlement to crude oil production are recorded as a debtor and measured at the lower of production cost, including depreciation, and market value, whereas overlifts are recorded as a creditor and measured at market value.
i Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
j Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts invoiced exclusive of sales related taxes for the Groups share of oil sales or charter revenue in the year.
Oil sales revenue is recognised when the oil has been lifted and title has passed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
k Shipping repairs and renewals Ships are dry-docked periodically and the costs are expensed as incurred.
Other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
l Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than US dollars foreign currencies are recorded in US dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into US dollars at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group may enter into forward contracts and options see below for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups subsidiaries which do not use US dollars as their functional currency are translated into US dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups profit and loss reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 cumulative foreign exchange translation differences for all subsidiaries which do not use US dollars as a functional currency have been set to zero.
m leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
42 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POlICIES continued n Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas profits tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
o Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised at fair value on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Bank borrowings and loan notes Interest-bearing bank borrowings and loan notes are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company and Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to fluctuations in the price of crude oil.
From time to time, the Group uses forward crude oil sales contracts, swaps and options to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles and limits on the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised within cost of sales in the income statement as they arise.
p Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating fair value.
Fair value is measured by use of a binomial model where there are conditions attached to the vesting and exercising of equity instruments.
The expected life used in the model is adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
43 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 3 CRITICAl ACCOUNTING jUDGEmENTS AND kEy SOURCES OF ESTImATION UNCERTAINTy Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below.
a Recoverability of exploration and evaluation costs Under the full cost method of accounting for exploration and evaluation E&E costs, such costs are capitalised as intangible assets by reference to appropriate cost pools, and are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable value.
This assessment involves judgement as to i the likely future commerciality of the asset and when such commerciality should be determined, and ii future revenues and costs pertaining to any wider cost pool with which the asset in question is associated, and the discount rate to be applied to such revenues and costs for the purpose of deriving a recoverable value.
Note 13 discloses the carrying amounts of the Groups E&E assets.
key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
b Decommissioning The Group has potential decommissioning obligations in respect of its producing interests in Turkmenistan and the Republic of Congo.
The extent to which a provision is required in respect of these potential obligations depends, inter alia, on the legal requirements at the time of decommissioning, the cost and timing of any necessary decommissioning works, and the discount rate to be applied to such costs.
In addition, in certain jurisdictions the local authorities assume liability for such costs if they elect to continue production activities at the end of the licence or Production Sharing Agreement PSA period, which in turn depends on the level of commercial reserves remaining at the time of expiry.
Based on these factors, the Directors do not believe that there is a material decommissioning liability at 31 December 2005 or 31 December 2004. c Reserves Development and production assets within Property, Plant and Equipment are depreciated on a unit of production basis at a rate calculated by reference to proven and probable entitlement reserves commercial reserves and incorporating the estimated future cost of developing and extracting those reserves.
Commercial reserves are determined using estimates of oil in place, recovery factors and future oil prices, the latter having an impact on the proportion of the gross reserves which are attributable to the host government under the terms of the PSA.
Future development costs are estimated using assumptions as to numbers of wells required to produce the commercial reserves, the cost of such wells and associated production facilities, and other capital and operating costs.
The current long-term Brent oil price assumption used in the estimation of commercial reserves is US$40.00.
The impact upon commercial reserves and the aggregate depletion charge for the year of a US$5.00 variation in the long term Brent oil price assumption is shown in the table below.
The carrying amount of development and production assets at 31 December 2005 is shown in note 14.
Commercial Depletion reserves charge Long term Brent Price million barrels US$ million US$35 106.4 65.1 US$40 104.2 65.5 US$45 102.6 66.0 The level of estimated commercial reserves is also a key determinant in assessing whether the carrying value of any of the Groups development and production assets has been impaired.

Accordingly, the applicable tax rate used above is the average statutory rate of tax, weighted in proportion to accounting profits, applicable across the Group.
The Groups tax liability in the Republic of Congo is settled out of its share of oil under the terms of PSA and, as such, is not reflected in the tax charge for the year.
During 2004 the statutory tax rate in Turkmenistan was reduced from 25% to 20%.
The deferred tax provision at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 is made up solely from accelerated tax depreciation and the movement in both years has been charged to the income statement.
A deferred tax asset of US$20.9 million at 31 December 2005 in the UK 2004: US$3.2 million, principally relating to carried forward tax losses, deferred share scheme deductions and foreign tax credits, has not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence of suitable UK taxable profits in the foreseeable future to enable the asset to be recovered.
UK tax losses do not have an expiration date.
Deferred tax assets of US$0.7 million at 31 December 2005 in Cyprus 2004: US$0.4 million and US$1.4 million at 31 December 2005 2004: US$0.9 million in Russia relating to tax losses, have not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence of suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future to enable the assets to be recovered.
Cypriot tax losses do not have an expiration date, however, Russian tax losses expire after 10 years.
There are no material unrecognised temporary differences associated with the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries.

On an historical cost basis, the carrying value of the Groups development and production assets West Africa would have been US$137,541,000 2004: US$111,417,000.
The Group has pledged all its development and production assets in Turkmenistan and Congo, which account for substantially all of the development and production assets in the above table, as security for a medium-term loan facility granted to the Group.
15 ACqUISITION OF ASSOCIATE On 14 February 2005, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Unocal Bharat Limited UBL, a company incorporated in Bermuda, for cash consideration of US$26,010,000.
The principal asset of UBL is a 26% interest in Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Limited HOEC, a publicly quoted Indian oil and gas exploration and production company.

Hardy Oil and Gas Limited Hardy, a company incorporated in the Isle of Man, has instigated legal action asserting that the acquisition of UBL by Burren infringed upon its rights, principally those of pre-emption, under a shareholder agreement signed in 1997 amongst the major shareholders of HOEC at that time.
The Group is disputing that Hardy is party to the shareholder agreement and that the acquisition of UBL infringed upon the terms of that agreement.
In the opinion of the Directors, it is not probable that the outcome of these actions will result in any material adverse change to the reported financial position of the Group.

The average credit period given on sales of crude oil is 30 days from bill of lading.
No interest is charged on the receivables.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of crude of US$103,000 2004: US$222,000.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade debtors and other debtors approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade debtors and other debtors.
Trade debtors are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is considered by management to be limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has a significant concentration of credit risk within its trade debtors since its Turkmenistan production and its Congo production are each all sold to a single purchaser.
However in each case the purchaser is part of a major global oil group, and therefore the credit risk is considered by management to be acceptable.

Accordingly, an amount of US$23,333,333 2004: US$11,666,666 in respect of the resulting deferred payment has been included in trade creditors and accruals, and capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates their fair value.
19 DERIvATIvE FINANCIAl INSTRUmENTS The Financial Review contains a summary of the objectives and policies for holding or issuing oil price derivative instruments and similar contracts and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the period.
At 31 December 2005, there were no open derivative positions.
At 31 December 2004, the Group had hedged 1,000,000 barrels of crude oil via a cap and collar agreement with a maximum Dated Brent price of US$30.15 bbl and a minimum of US$28.00 bbl.
The fair value of such open derivative positions, based on third party forward prices, amounted to a liability of US$nil 2004: US$10,528,000.
These derivative contracts were not designated as accounting hedges and accordingly the movement in fair values, amounting to a gain of US$10,528,000, has been taken to the income statement during the year.
Together with realised losses of US$24,288,000 2004: US$25,903,000 this resulted in a total loss on oil price derivatives contracts of US$13,760,000 2004: US$30,964,000.
20 lONG TERm BORROWINGS 2005 2004 US$000 US$000 Secured loan due in more than two years but less than five years 1,500 During the year the Group fully repaid the US$1,500,000 secured loan 12.5% 2007 from Sunfloat Shipping Ltd a related party, details of which are provided in note 31.
On 11 August 2005 the Group entered into a facility agreement with Natexis Banques Populaires Natexis for a US dollar revolving borrowing base loan facility of up to US$150 million for a term of four years.
The amount of the facility currently available is US$80 million.
Amounts drawn bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin and the facility is secured via a charge over the Groups shares in i Burren Resources Petroleum Limited, which holds the Groups interests in Turkmenistan, and ii Burren Energy Congo Limited, which holds the Groups interests in Congo.
No amounts were drawn under this loan facility at the year-end.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of the Groups borrowings approximates the fair value.

All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
All lease obligations are denominated in US dollars.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
The Directors consider that the fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.
22 OBlIGATIONS UNDER OPERATING lEASES At the balance sheet date the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases which fall due as follows: 2005 2004 land and Plant and Land and Plant and buildings machinery buildings machinery US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Operating leases which expire: Within one year 1,687 1,687 In over five years 2,760 3,474 2,760 1,687 3,474 1,687 2005 2004 land and Plant and Land and Plant and buildings machinery buildings machinery US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised in income statement 552 1,687 579 1,687 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office properties and for the bareboat charter of its ships.

29 ShARE BASED PAymENTS AND OThER INCENTIvE SChEmE ARRANGEmENTS A summary of the Groups employee incentive schemes is set out below.
The schemes accounted for under IFRS 2 are as follows: Performance Share Plan the PSP One set of awards comprising an option to acquire shares in the Company for nil payment was made on 12 November 2003 in respect of an aggregate of 481,922 ordinary shares.
Vesting of these awards was dependent on a number of share price performance targets being met in the three year period following the Companys flotation in December 2003.
All such performance conditions have been met and the shares will vest on 12 November 2006.
Burren Energy Annual Profit Sharing Scheme the APSS Under the APSS, 5% of the Groups operating profit on ordinary activities after interest, financing charges, taxation and the payment of this sum, but before the deduction of any exceptional items as disclosed in the Groups accounts, is paid to its employees as an annual bonus.
Any amount payable in excess of 50% of annual base salary with respect to Executive Directors and Senior Managers and 100% of base annual salary for all other staff, are made as a right to acquire shares in the Company, the exercise of which is deferred for a period of three years a Deferred APSS Award.
No payment is required upon exercise of any Deferred APSS Award.
No payment is required from the option holder upon exercise.
The number of shares in the Company subject to a Deferred bonus will normally be calculated using the Companys average share price over the last 30 days of the financial year to which the Deferred bonus relates.
The Deferred bonus will normally be able to be exercised in the six months commencing from the third anniversary of the end of the financial year to which the deferred bonus relates.
The share based elements of the above schemes are substantially similar, involving the award of equity settled share options at a nil exercise price, and accordingly the information for the schemes has been aggregated.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year in respect of these two schemes are as follows: 2005 2004 Number of Number of share options share options Outstanding at beginning of period 608,459 481,922 Granted during the period 265,185 126,537 Outstanding at the end of the period 873,644 608,459 Exercisable at the end of the period 54 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005 29 ShARE BASED PAymENTS AND OThER INCENTIvE SChEmE ARRANGEmENTS continued No share options were exercised during the year in respect of the above schemes.
Options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.71 years 2004: 2.37 years.
As all of the share options have a nil exercise price the fair value at the date of grant was assumed to be equal to the share price on that day.
For share options granted in the year, the weighted average fair value of the options at measurement date was US$8.88 per share 2004: US$2.39 per share based on the Groups share price on the date of grant.
During 2005, a charge of US$1,261,000 2004: US$476,000 was recorded in respect of equity settled share payments accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
Under IFRS 2, charges in relation to equity settled share based payments are credited to a Shares to be Issued Reserve, therefore no liabilities have been recorded in respect of these schemes.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and long-Term Incentive Plan 2003 lTIP The share options in these schemes were all either granted prior to 7 November 2002 or had vested by 1 January 2005 and therefore do not fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
Accordingly, the only charges arising in 2004 and 2005 in relation to these schemes relates to National Insurance Contributions NICs, based on the Companys share price at the balance sheet date see below.
Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, awards may be taken in the form of shares or cash consideration at the discretion of the employee.
The award is dependent on meeting performance criteria as set out and determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The amounts in place at 31 December 2005 relate to awards in respect of the performance year ended 31 March 2003, which have fully vested.
Summary of charges to the income statement The total charge in relation to the Groups share based payment arrangements was as follows: 2005 2004 US$000 US$000 APSS cash element 3,632 1,736 deferred bonus 886 101 PSP 375 375 NICs on ESOS 1,611 2,129 NICs on LTIP 927 1,177 Total 7,431 5,518 Included in charges for incentive schemes is $US3,632,000 2004: $US1,736,000 relating to the cash element of the APSS which does not fall within the scope of IFRS 2 and is charged to the profit and loss account in the year of award.

a Intangible assets other than goodwill Under UK GAAP, intangible fixed assets represented pre-licence acquisition costs and exploration and evaluation E&E costs of individual licence interests held outside the depreciable cost pools pending determination of commerciality.
Under IFRS, intangible assets have been adjusted to write off cumulative pre-licence acquisition costs of US$507,000 and to include E&E costs of US$2,836,000 that under UK GAAP had been capitalised in a full cost pool within tangible fixed assets, resulting in a net increase of US$2,329,000.
b Property, plant and equipment Under UK GAAP, tangible fixed assets comprised: Oil and gas properties for which the existence or otherwise of commercial reserves had been established, recorded by reference to broad, geographic cost pools.
This caption also included certain exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred within the cost pools.
Other fixed assets, including non oil and gas specific plant and equipment, office furniture, barges and tugs.
Under IFRS, all amounts previously classified as tangible fixed assets have been recorded as Property, Plant and Equipment except for exploration and evaluation expenditure of US$2,836,000 in relation to non-producing fields for which the existence of commercial reserves has not yet been determined reclassified to intangible assets.
Additional accumulated depreciation of US$284,000 has also been charged under IFRS, as described in note b to the reconciliation of profit for 2004.
This has resulted in a net decrease at 31 December 2003 of US$3,120,000.
57 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 32 ExPlANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS continued c Trade and other payables The decrease of US$4,171,000 results from the fide-recognition of an accrual under UK GAAP for the deferred share element of the 2003 APSS award which, under IFRS, will be accrued over the 36 month vesting period beginning 1 January 2004 and the reclassification of an accrual for existing share schemes to a shares to be issued reserve in line with IFRS.
d Unrealised gains and losses on oil price derivative contracts The liability of US$5,467,000 recognised under IFRS represents the mark-to-market liability unrealised loss of the Brent collar contracts that were open at year end based on market quotations.
e Shares to be issued The difference between the measurement and accounting treatment of share incentive scheme awards is described in note d to the reconciliation of profit for 2004.
Under both UK GAAP and IFRS charges made to income in respect of share incentive scheme awards are credited to a Shares to be Issued reserve.
The US$3,888,000 addition to this reserve reflects the cumulative increase in share incentive scheme charges prior to transition date and reclassification as discussed in note c above.
f Profit and loss account The above adjustments result in a US$5,975,000 reduction in retained earnings.

Consolidated income statement a Oil price derivative contracts Under UK GAAP realised losses on oil price derivative contracts were netted off against turnover.
Under IFRS hedge accounting treatment for the outstanding contracts is not achievable owing to the absence of documentation demonstrating the effectiveness of the contract from the outset.
Realised losses on these contracts, amounting to US$25,903,000, have therefore been included in cost of sales and revenue has been increased by an equivalent amount.
Under UK GAAP unrealised gains and losses on oil price derivative contracts relating to expected future sales of crude were only accounted for when the related physical transaction occurred.
However under IFRS such contracts are marked to market and the fair value recognised in the balance sheet.
The resultant movement in fair values is recognised in the profit and loss account: this amounted to a loss of US$5,061,000.
Together with realised losses of US$25,903,000 this resulted in a total loss on oil price derivatives contracts of US$30,964,000.
b Depreciation Under UK GAAP costs carried within each regional cost pool, which may contain a number of individual fields, were depreciated on a unit of production basis by reference to that cost pool.
Under IFRS costs are still depreciated on a unit of production basis but by reference to specific fields.
The accounting change has increased depreciation by US$569,000 for the year ended 31 December 2004. c Pre-licence costs Under UK GAAP all costs incurred prior to having obtained the licence rights were included within intangible fixed assets.
Under IFRS such expenditure has to be written off in full in the year in which it occurs.
Cost of sales has therefore increased by US$12,000.
60 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005 32 ExPlANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS continued d Charge in respect of share incentive schemes The Group operates a number of share incentive schemes.
Under UK GAAP deferred share awards were valued at their intrinsic value at the balance sheet date having no regard to potential future share price movements and charged to the income statement in the financial year to which the award related.
IFRS requires deferred share awards granted by the Company to employees to be valued at fair value at the grant date.
Such fair value should be based on a model appropriate to value the inherent optionality of the incentive schemes including but not limited to potential future share price movements, and charged to the income statement pro rata over the vesting period of the related awards.
The transitional provisions of IFRS 2 allow that share incentive options granted before 7 November 2002 or which vested before 1 January 2005 are exempt from restatement.
On this basis restatements have only been required for the following two schemes: Performance Share Plan The cost in relation to this plan, which consists of share options granted before the Initial Public Offering IPO, and vesting over a three year period, was fully charged to the income statement in 2004 under UK GAAP as the related performance criteria had been met in full.
Under IFRS this charge is spread over the vesting period.
This has resulted in a credit to the income statement of US$772,000.
Annual Profit Share Scheme APSS This scheme includes both a cash and a deferred share element, with shares issued under the latter vesting over a three year period.
The cost of both elements of this scheme was fully charged to the income statement in 2004 under UK GAAP.
However under IFRS the deferred share element of this charge is spread over the vesting period.
This has resulted in a credit to the income statement of US$2,038,000.
This accounting change has therefore reduced the charge in respect of share incentive schemes by US$2,810,000.
e Dividends declared Under UK GAAP proposed dividends were recognised in the financial year in respect of which they relate, even if such dividends were declared subsequent to the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS they are recognised in the period in which they are formally declared.
The change in timing of recognising proposed dividends increased reported retained earnings of the Group as at 31 December 2004 by US$7,550,000, being the 2004 dividend proposed in 2005. f Taxation There was no impact on current or deferred tax charges for the year ended 31 December 2004.
This was because the adjustments either increased the size of a deferred tax asset that has not been treated as recoverable or because they arose in a jurisdiction with a zero percentage tax rate.
Consolidated balance sheet g Intangible assets other than goodwill For the reasons described in note a to the reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004, intangible assets have been adjusted to write off cumulative prelicence acquisition costs of US$519,000 and to include E&E costs of US$5,104,000 that under UK GAAP had been capitalised in a full cost pool within tangible fixed assets, giving a net increase in intangible assets of US$4,585,000.
h Property, plant and equipment For the reasons described in note b to the reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004, all amounts previously classified as tangible fixed assets have been recorded as property, plant and equipment except for exploration and evaluation expenditure of US$5,104,000 in relation to non-producing fields for which the existence of commercial reserves has not yet been determined reclassified to intangible assets.
Additional cumulative depreciation of US$853,000 has also been charged under IFRS, for the reasons described in b above.
Following reclassification of casing and tubing on hand US$3,189,265 has also been transferred from fixed assets to stock.
i Trade and other payables The decrease of US$7,550,000 results from the proposed dividend being recognised under IFRS in the period in which it was formally declared, being 2005, instead of in 2004. j Unrealised gains and losses on oil price derivative contracts The liability of US$10,528,000 recognised under IFRS represents the mark-to-market liability unrealised loss of the Brent collar contracts that were open at year end based on market quotations.
Of this US$ 5,467,000 was recognised in the restated balance sheet at the transition date.
The difference of US$5,061,000 has been charged to the 2004 income statement.
k Shares to be issued The difference between the measurement and accounting treatment of share incentive scheme awards is described in note d above.
Under both UK GAAP and IFRS charges made to income in respect of share incentive scheme awards are credited to a Shares to be issued reserve.
The US$3,093,000 reduction in this reserve reflects the cumulative reduction in share incentive scheme charges to income, of which US$2,810,000 was credited to the 2004 income statement.
61 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 32 ExPlANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS continued l Profit and loss account The above adjustments result in a US$1,257,000 reduction in retained earnings.
Consolidated cash flow statement m Reclassifications from UK GAAP The UK GAAP denominated figures are shown after reclassifying certain standard headings under UK GAAP being taxation, returns on investments and servicing of finance and capital expenditure to their equivalents under IFRS.
n Reclassification of pre-licence expenditure Pre-licence costs were shown within Capital expenditure under UK GAAP.
Since such costs are being expensed under IFRS, they have been classified within operating cash flows under IFRS.
o Reclassification of fixed asset expenditure Purchases of tangible fixed assets under UK GAAP have been reclassified to purchases of intangible assets and purchases of property, plant and equipment under IFRS.
p Reclassification of casing and tubing Casing and tubing on hand of US$3,189,265 has been reclassified from fixed assets to stock.
Accordingly, payments made in respect of such assets have been reclassified from investing to operating cash flows.
q Reclassification of exploration commitments Deposits made in relation to exploration commitments of US$7,000,000 have been reclassified from operating to investing cash flows.
