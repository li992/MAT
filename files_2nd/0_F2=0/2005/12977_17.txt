The Rank Group Plc 57 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 4 Exceptional items 2005 2004 Note m m Exceptional items relating to continuing operations Provision for onerous leases on vacant properties 12.1 Financing charge 3.6 Loss on disposal of business 4.1 Impairment charge 37.4 Taxation 6 24.3 10.3 Exceptional items relating to discontinued operations Deluxe Media Services 136.5 127.0 Deluxe Film 150.4 Taxation 6 20.8 1.9 Total exceptional items 257.5 156.3 The Group defines exceptional items as those items which by their size or nature would distort the comparability of the Groups result from year to year, including restructuring costs and profit or loss on disposal of tangible assets or businesses.
2005 exceptional items In light of the reduced opportunities presented by the 2005 Gambling Act, the Group reviewed its onerous lease provision against vacant properties.
As a result of this review and other events occurring in the year the Group recognised an onerous lease charge of 12.1m within continuing operations.
During the year, the Group incurred exceptional nancing costs of 3.6m as a result of the closure of an outstanding issue with the tax authorities.
The Group disposed of the Deluxe Film business on 27 January 2006.
At 31 December 2005, the Group wrote down the carrying value of the Deluxe Film business to net sales proceeds less future cash costs to sell including the Groups s75 pension obligation.
In addition, the Group incurred transaction costs relating to the disposal which are also included within exceptional items.
The total pre-tax exceptional charge incurred was 150.4m.
The Group has reported a pre-tax 136.5m exceptional charge which includes the revision to the expected net realisable value of the Deluxe Media Services business 80.2m, European restructuring costs 27.5m and US bad debt costs and restructuring costs 28.8m.
The adjustment to the held for sale carrying value of Deluxe Media Services recognises that the value expected to be received for the business is likely to be substantially lower than previously stated.
2004 exceptional items In 2004, a 4.1m exceptional loss was recognised principally on the disposal of the Rank Leisure Machine Services business at the start of 2004.
In 2004 in Mecca an impairment charge of 6.4m was recognised in respect of certain clubs where the cashow associated with those clubs was less than the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.
During 2004 Hard Rock performed a detailed review and decided to relocate the agship New York Cafe and to close the Vault, a rock and roll museum in Orlando.
In addition, impairment reviews were performed on a number of underperforming units and some discontinued merchandise was written off.
This resulted in an exceptional charge of 31.0m of which 23.3m related to impairment of xed assets, 4.8m to onerous lease provisions and 2.9m to the write-off of discontinued merchandise.
In May 2004, Deluxe Media Services was informed by a major studio that it would be transferring its business to another supplier on a staged basis over the period to July 2005.
This contract related primarily to European DVD manufacturing and distribution.
As a result an exceptional charge of 23.1m, comprising an impairment charge of 18.0m, onerous lease provisions of 3.8m, and other costs of 1.3m, have been recorded.
Deluxe Media Services also incurred an exceptional charge in 2004 of 4.0m for the closure of VHS manufacturing facilities in Germany, Italy and Portugal.
In 2004, the Group decided to separate Deluxe Media Services from the rest of the Group and wrote down the carrying value of the business to expected proceeds.
As a result, Deluxe Media Service was classied as a business held for sale and a 99.9m charge was recognised consisting of 4.1m for other costs and impairments totalling 95.8m.

7 Discontinued operations The Deluxe Media Services and the Deluxe Film businesses meet the IFRS criteria required to be classied as discontinued operations.
As a result, Deluxe Media Services and Deluxe Film revenue is excluded from the income statement and the results of the businesses, including any associated exceptional costs, are recorded in a single line on a post tax basis.
Deluxe Film was sold on 27 January 2006 resulting in the crystallisation of the provision for loss on disposal.
While the sale of Deluxe Media Services has not yet been completed the business met the criteria to be classied as an operation held for sale at both 31 December 2004 and 2005.
A breakdown of the results of discontinued operations is shown below.

The Group has one class of dilutive potential Ordinary shares namely those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year.
In 2004, the share conversion relating to the Groups 167.7m convertible bond was also dilutive.
Options are dilutive at the profit from continuing operations level and so, in accordance with IAS 33, have been treated as dilutive for the purpose of diluted earnings per share.
The diluted loss per share is lower than basic loss per share because of the effect of losses on discontinued operations.

Management believes that adjusted earnings reects the underlying performance of the business and assists in providing a view of the fundamental strength of the Group.
Adjusted net earnings attributable to equity shareholders is derived as follows: 2005 2004 m m Net loss attributable to equity shareholders 209.7 15.0 Discontinued operations net of taxation 254.1 74.3 Exceptional items before tax on continuing operations 15.7 41.5 Foreign currency loss gain on inter-company balances 16.0 5.9 Interest on convertible bond 3.0 Taxation on adjusted items 16.2 19.1 Adjusted net earnings attributable to equity shareholders 62.9 75.8 The Rank Group Plc 63 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 11 Intangible assets Casino and other gaming Goodwill licences Other Total Group m m m m Cost At 1 January 2004 136.1 111.0 48.4 295.5 Acquisitions through business combinations 26.4 3.6 11.1 41.1 Purchase of minority interest 3.8 3.8 Fair value adjustments 2.7 2.7 Classied as held for sale 30.8 25.4 56.2 Exchange adjustments 4.1 4.1 At 31 December 2004 134.1 114.6 34.1 282.8 Acquisitions through business combinations 5.7 0.5 6.2 Additions internally generated 6.4 6.4 Disposals 0.6 0.6 Fair value adjustments 2.5 0.3 1.0 1.8 Classied as held for sale 91.4 15.3 106.7 Exchange adjustments 7.9 0.6 2.5 9.8 At 31 December 2005 53.8 114.2 28.1 196.1 Aggregate amortisation and impairment At 1 January 2004 12.2 30.1 42.3 Charge for the period 10.1 10.1 Impairment losses 30.8 3.7 34.5 Classied as held for sale 30.8 25.4 56.2 Exchange adjustments 0.2 0.2 At 31 December 2004 12.0 18.5 30.5 Charge for the period 5.6 5.6 Impairment losses 79.2 0.4 79.6 Disposals 0.6 0.6 Classied as held for sale 91.4 7.7 99.1 Exchange adjustments 0.2 1.7 1.9 At 31 December 2005 17.9 17.9 Net book value at 31 December 2004 122.1 114.6 15.6 252.3 Net book value at 31 December 2005 53.8 114.2 10.2 178.2 Other assets comprise brands, other licences, computer software and development technology and customer lists.

The Group classies goodwill and casino and other gaming licences as indefinite life assets.
Goodwill a Blue Square The Group has goodwill with a carrying value of 53.8m in respect of the acquisition of Blue Square 2004 54.4m.
As at 31 December 2005 management does not believe that the carrying value of the Blue Square goodwill was impaired as the value in use exceeded the carrying value of goodwill by 12.1m.
The whole of Blue Square, excluding the Blue Square betting shop which is a separate cash generating unit, is treated as a single cash generating unit and is tested for impairment on that basis.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board for the next financial year along with projections for the following four years from the Groups Strategic Plan which was also approved by the Board.
No growth is applied to cash ows beyond year five.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash ow projections is 10.4% 2004 12.0%.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The calculation of value in use for Blue Square is most sensitive to the following assumptions: settled stakes: gross win margins: and discount rates Settled stakes are based on monies placed by customers for the sportsbook and gaming businesses.
Management take into account the product mix, major sporting events and industry developments when determining settled stakes.
Gross win margins are based on values achieved in the past and amended for any anticipated changes in the budget period.
Discount rates reect managements estimate of the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Management believes that the Groups weighted average cost of capital is an appropriate measure as there is no funding directly attributable to that group of assets.
The Rank Group Plc 66 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 13 Impairment review continued Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of Blue Square, there are possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Settled stakes may be affected by inter alia a decrease in customers, a decrease in marketing spend, a change in technology, competition or regulatory changes Gross win margins may be affected by the results of sporting events, odds setting or in changes in legislation to the gaming industry Gross win is calculated by applying the win margin to stakes placed.
If gross win were to decrease by 1.4m each year the value in use would equal the carrying value of the cash generating unit.
b Deluxe Film As at 31 December 2005 Deluxe Film has been treated as held for sale as detailed in note 7.
The Deluxe Film business has been written down to net recoverable value.
As at 31 December 2004 the Group had goodwill with a carrying value of 67.7m in respect of acquisitions made by Deluxe Film.
Management did not believe that the carrying value of this goodwill was impaired as the value in use exceeded the carrying value of goodwill.
In 2004 the whole of Deluxe Film was treated as a single cash generating unit and tested for impairment on that basis.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill was determined based on a value in use calculation using cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board for the next financial year along with projections for the following four years from the Groups Strategic Plan which was also approved by the Board.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash ow projections was 12.0%.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The calculation of value in use for Deluxe Film is most sensitive to the following assumptions: lm footage: contract pricing: labour and lm stock costs: and discount rates.
Revenues were based on the expected footage processed under each studio contract and won in the marketplace uncontracted footage.
Management will take into account the release schedule for the coming year, historic patterns and industry developments when determining revenues.
Costs were based on historic levels adjusted for expected price rises and wage increases.
Management believes that the Groups weighted average cost of capital is an appropriate measure as there is not funding directly attributable to that group of assets.
Casino and other gaming licences a Grosvenor The inherent value of casino licences is deemed to be an intrinsic part of value of the operation of casinos as a whole and is not therefore split out from total casino assets in an impairment review.
The cost of casino licences as at 31 December 2005 was 94.3m 2004 94.3m and management does not believe that there is any impairment.
Each Grosvenor casino has been treated as a separate cash generating unit, and tested for impairment on that basis.
The recoverable amount of each Grosvenor casino including the licence has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board for the next financial year.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash ow projections is 10.4% 2004 12.0%.
In all cases the value in use calculation exceeded the carrying value and there was no impairment.
No reasonably possible change in a key assumption would cause the carrying value of the cash generating units to be equal to their value in use.
b Spanish bingo The inherent value of Spanish bingo is deemed to be an intrinsic part of value of the operations as a whole and is not therefore split out from Spanish bingo assets in an impairment review.
The cost of Spanish bingo licences as at 31 December 2005 was 19.9m 2004 20.3m and management does not believe that there is any impairment.
The Rank Group Plc 67 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 13 Impairment review continued Impairment review of property, plant and equipment As stated in the accounting policies note section K if the carrying value of the Groups property, plant and equipment is higher than the estimated recoverable amount the value of those assets is written down.
2005 Grosvenor In 2005 an impairment charge of 3.2m has been recognised in respect of one casino.
Mecca In 2005 an impairment charge of 0.6m has been recognised in respect of a number of clubs where the cash ows associated with those clubs were less than the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment.
2004 Hard Rock In 2004 at Hard Rock, following a detailed review, it was decided to relocate a number of key cafes starting with New York, to close the Vault, a rock and roll museum in Orlando, and to write down a number of underperforming units.
As a result a charge of 31.0m was incurred of which 2.9m related to inventory, 4.8m related to onerous leases and 23.3m related to property, plant and equipment.
Mecca In 2004 in Mecca an impairment charge of 6.4m was recognised in respect of certain clubs where the cash ows associated with those clubs were less than the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.
This charge was treated as an operating exceptional item.
On transition to IFRS an impairment charge of 28.3m was recognised at 1 January 2004 in respect of certain clubs where the cash ows associated with those clubs were less than the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.
This charge was recognised in opening reserves.
This had not been recognised under UK GAAP as the Mecca business in the UK had been treated as a single Income Generating Unit under FRS 11, Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill.

21 Financial instruments A description of the policies relating to financial instruments is set out in the operating and financial review on page 25 and also in the accounting policies on page 49.
Except where indicated otherwise, the disclosures below relate to both the year ended 2005, for which IAS 32 and IAS 39 have been applied by the Group, and the year ended 31 December 2004, for which UK GAAP was applied to the Groups financial instruments.
a Interest risk management Financial liabilities Gross borrowings of 1,450.1m 2004 894.9m include loan capital and borrowings of 858.0m note 20 2004 711.9m and the effect of currency and interest rate swaps.
After taking account of interest rate and currency rate swaps, the currency and interest rate exposure of gross borrowings as at 31 December 2005 and 2004 was: Floating Gross rate Fixed rate borrowings borrowings borrowings 2005 m m m Sterling 696.5 478.8 217.7 US Canadian dollar 598.5 362.4 236.1 Other currencies net 155.1 152.7 2.4 1,450.1 993.9 456.2 The Rank Group Plc 73 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial instruments continued Floating Gross rate Fixed rate borrowings borrowings borrowings 2004 m m m Sterling 298.1 78.7 219.4 US Canadian dollar 476.5 266.8 209.7 Other currencies net 120.3 119.9 0.4 894.9 465.4 429.5 At 31 December 2005 the xed interest rates vary from 5.4% to 7.1% 2004 5.4% to 7.1% and oating rates are LIBOR 1.9% 2004 LIBOR 1.9%.
The gain deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement during the next three years being the life of the swap.
Sterling borrowings above includes the 154.9m convertible bond.
At 31 December 2005 the convertible bond is accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, whereas at 31 December 2004 the convertible bond is accounted for in accordance with the Groups UK GAAP accounting policies.
The different accounting policies and the effect on the carrying value at 1 January 2005 are set out in note 41.
In addition to the amounts disclosed in the above tables, the following meet the denition of financial liabilities: the Groups provisions of 37.8m 2004 27.7m for vacant leasehold properties note 23 are considered to be oating rate financial liabilities.
This is because in establishing the provisions, the cash ows have been discounted using a discount rate which is re-appraised at each half-yearly reporting date to ensure it reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the liability.
32.9m 2004 9.7m of the balance is denominated in sterling and the remainder in US and Canadian dollars.
Financial assets The financial assets shown below include cash, cash equivalents, available for sale investments and the sterling element of currency rate swaps.

The currencies hedged are US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Australian Dollars and Japanese Yen.
d Fair values The estimated fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2005 and 2004 are set out below.
The fair value of quoted borrowings is based on year-end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair values of other borrowings and the derivative financial instruments are estimated by discounting the future cash ows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year-end.
Short term debtors, creditors and financial instruments held within discontinued operations have been excluded from the following disclosures on the basis that their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation to fair value.
The Rank Group Plc 75 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial instruments continued Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial instruments, excluding those classied under discontinued operations, that are carried in the financial statements: Net carrying Fair Net carrying Fair amount value amount value 2005 2005 2004 2004 m m m m Short term financial liabilities and current portion of long term borrowings 19.6 19.6 19.8 19.8 Long term borrowings 838.4 824.5 692.1 688.3 Cash at bank and liquid investments 117.7 117.7 75.6 75.6 The difference between net carrying amount and estimated fair value reects unrealised gains or losses inherent in the instruments based on valuations at 31 December 2005.
The volatile nature of the markets means that values at any subsequent date could be signicantly different from the values reported above.

At 31 December 2005 the convertible bonds are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, whereas at 31 December 2004 the convertible bonds are accounted for in accordance with the Groups UK GAAP accounting policies.
The different accounting policies and the effect on the carrying value at 1 January 2005 are set out in note 41. e Financial derivative instruments As explained in the operating and financial review on page 25, the Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: interest rate risk, using interest and currency swaps: and currency risk, using forward foreign currency contracts for foreign currency receipts and payments.
Forward foreign currency contracts are also used for currency exposures on future years forecasted sales.
As explained in note 41, the Group has applied IAS 39 to the accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging from 1 January 2005.
Separate disclosures are presented below for derivative financial instruments and hedging for 2005 and 2004.

Participants save a xed amount of up to 250 per month for either three or five years and are then able to use these savings to buy shares in the Company at a price xed at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period.
The SAYE options must ordinarily be exercised within six months of completing the relevant savings period, and are satisfied through the issue of new shares.
In line with market practice, the exercise of these options is not subject to any performance condition.
The Rank Group Plc 83 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 33 Share-based payments continued Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The executive Directors and selected senior executives are granted options to purchase shares in the Company at a price xed at market value at the date of grant.
For options to vest, there must be an average increase in normalised earnings per share EPS above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI over a three year period, as follows: Total exercise price Performance condition up to 1 x base salary RPI 3% per annum up to 2 x base salary RPI 5% per annum up to 3 x base salary RPI 7% per annum The maximum grant permitted under the Scheme is three times base salary.
For options granted before 2005, if the EPS condition is not met at the end of three years, the performance period may be extended for one further year, measuring EPS growth from the original base year.
If this condition is not met at the end of the fourth year, the options will lapse.
For options granted in or after 2005, this retesting provision has been removed and EPS performance is measured only over the three year performance period.
The ESOS options must ordinarily be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant, and are satisfied through the issue of new shares.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The executive Directors and selected senior executives are awarded shares in the Company subject to achieving a total shareholder return TSR target.
To ensure these awards do not vest at a time of overall unsatisfactory financial performance, there must also be an increase in normalised EPS of at least 2% per annum above the growth in RPI over a three year period.
The TSR target measures the Companys growth relative to 19 comparator companies.
100% of the shares vest if the Company achieves upper quartile performance, 30% of the shares vest at median performance, and awards vest on a straight line basis for performance in between.
No shares vest if performance is below median.
The LTIP awards are satisfied through the market purchase of shares.
These options have not been subsequently modied and therefore are not required to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The Rank Group Plc 84 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 33 Share-based payments continued The share options outstanding at the year-end have the following range of exercise prices and expiry dates as follows: Outstanding at Outstanding at 31 December 2005 31 December 2004 Weighted Weighted average Number average Number Exercise remaining of shares Exercise remaining of shares prices contractual under prices contractual under range life option range life option ESOS 187.50p475.76p 6.7 years 12,129,249 176.50p475.76p 7.0 years 12,771,916 ShareSave 3 year 191.00p268.00p 1.4 years 3,033,616 141.00p268.00p 1.4 years 2,808,429 ShareSave 5 year 141.00p268.00p 2.9 years 2,581,567 141.00p268.00p 2.4 years 2,565,805 The estimated fair values for each of the ESOS and ShareSave awards granted were calculated using a Black-Scholes pricing model with the inputs detailed below.
The fair value of the LTIP was calculated using a Monte Carlo model approach, and indicates the proportion of shares likely to vest, taking into account the Total Shareholder Return performance requirements.
For grants made subject to an EPS performance condition, the expense is based on expectations of these conditions being met, which are reassessed at each balance sheet date.
These calculations assume that the EPS performance conditions will be met in full.

The expected life of the LTIP and ShareSave are determined by the performance period and savings terms respectively.
The expected share price volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the four calendar years prior to each grant i. e. the same duration as the expected life of the ESOS and the midpoint of the expected lives for the LTIP and ShareSave.
The expected dividend growth is based on historical dividend payments in the year prior to grant, expressed as a percentage of the weighted average share price for that year.
As such, this is based on historical data and does not necessarily indicate future dividend policy.
The weighted average fair value per share of awards granted during the year was as follows: 2005 2004 ESOS 60.94p 72.99p LTIP 275.50p 323.50p ShareSave 3 year 84.03p 95.53p ShareSave 5 year 82.25p 100.09p The effect of accounting for share-based payments in accordance with IFRS 2 on the Groups profit for the year was 4.2m 2004 3.1m.
National Insurance contributions are payable by the Company in respect of some of the share-based payments.
These contributions are payable on the date of exercise based on the intrinsic value of the share-based payments, and as such are treated as cash-settled awards.
The Group has recorded liabilities at the end of 2005 of 1.0m 2004 0.7m of which 0.4m was in respect of vested grants.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of the 5.7% assumption 2004 6.1%.

During 2005, Deluxe Film met the criteria to be classied as a discontinued operation held for sale.
The comparative 2004 information disclosed in the primary statements and related notes reect this classication.
In addition, the Group adopted IAS 32 and 39 on 1 January 2005.
As a result, revenue from sportsbetting and internet games is now measured using gross win margin rather than stakes placed.
The comparative 2004 information disclosed in the primary statements has also been presented on the same basis.
Net asset reconciliations are disclosed on pages 94 and 95.
The Rank Group Plc 91 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 40 Reconciliation of net assets and loss under UK GAAP to IFRS continued A Discontinued operations The Deluxe Media Services business DMS meets the IFRS criteria required to be classied as a discontinued operation held for sale as at 31 December 2004.
As a result, DMS revenue is excluded from the income statement reducing reported revenue by 385.1m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
In addition, the results of DMS, including any associated impairment, are reported in a single line on a post-tax basis.
DMS results have been restated for IFRS.
The restatement included the reversal of 76.7m of pre-1997 DMS goodwill charged to the income statement under UK GAAP, which was not required under IFRS and all relevant IFRS adjustments detailed below.
The impact of these IFRS adjustments resulted in a lower carrying value of the DMS business under IFRS compared with UK GAAP.
Consequently the provision for loss on disposal is smaller under IFRS by 5.5m.
The net loss for discontinued operations under IFRS for the year ended 31 December 2004 is 118.1m.
In the balance sheet, the assets and liabilities of DMS are presented separately as assets and liabilities held for sale.
B Mecca impairment In accordance with IFRS, testing to ensure that the cashows of Mecca are in excess of the carrying value is performed on a club by club basis.

The effect is to increase pre-exceptional operating by 2.3m for the year ended 31 December 2004 and increase the interest charge by 0.4m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
In addition, an exceptional impairment charge of 6.4m was recorded during 2004.
Tangible xed assets at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 are reduced by 28.3m and 30.7m respectively.
In addition, the onerous lease provision increases by 11.4m and 12.2m respectively.
C Leases i The Group has identied certain leases, which were classied as operating leases under UK GAAP, which under IFRS require reclassication as finance leases including the buildings element of operating leases for land and buildings, in respect of the buildings element of the lease.
As a consequence, operating lease expenses previously reported under UK GAAP were reclassied as depreciation and finance lease interest.
The impact is to increase operating profit by 2.2m and finance lease interest charges by 2.3m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
In addition, the reclassication of operating leases to finance leases resulted in the recognition of buildings with a net book value of 19.3m at 1 January 2004 and 17.7m at 31 December 2004.
At the same time a finance lease liability of 25.6m at 1 January 2004 and 24.2m at 31 December 2004 was also recognised.
ii In accordance with SIC 15, Operating Lease Incentives, operating lease incentives are spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Net of impairments, the impact is to increase xed assets by 4.1m at 1 January 2004 and 7.7m at 31 December 2004.
Finance lease obligations increased by 4.1m and 10.9m and deferred profit by 2.2m and 0.5m at the respective balance sheet dates.
D Intangible assets i In accordance with IAS 38, Intangible Assets, certain assets, classed as tangible assets under UK GAAP, have been reclassied as intangible assets.
The effect is to increase intangible assets at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 by 129.3m and 132.2m respectively and decrease tangible xed assets at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 by 129.3m and 132.2m, respectively.
The useful economic lives of these assets have remained unchanged under IFRS.
There is no impact on net profit for the year.
ii In accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, goodwill is not amortised but reviewed annually for impairment.
A review has been performed and goodwill has not been found to be impaired.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised on a straight line basis over a period of no more than 20 years.
The Group has chosen to take the exemptions available under IFRS 1, First-time adoption of IFRS, and not restated any business combinations entered into before the transition date.
Excluding DMS, the effect is to increase operating profit and intangible xed assets by 5.8m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Net of further impairment charges and before the transfer to assets held for sale, the reversal of goodwill amortisation relating to DMS increases net profit and assets by 0.3m at 31 December 2004. iii In accordance with IAS 38, Intangible Assets, separately identiable intangible assets, acquired as part of a business combination must be recognised on the acquirers balance sheet even if the intangible asset could not be recognised on the acquirees balance sheet.
The intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives.
Under UK GAAP, excess purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired was allocated to goodwill and amortised over the useful economic life of the goodwill.
The effect is to decrease operating profit and intangible xed assets by 0.1m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The Rank Group Plc 92 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 40 Reconciliation of net assets and loss under UK GAAP to IFRS continued E Employee benets i In accordance with IFRS 2, Share Based Payments, the fair value of all the Groups share options plans at grant date should be spread over the vesting period.
The fair value is estimated using common valuation techniques.
Under UK GAAP, the income statement charge was based on the difference between the exercise price and market price at date of grant with no expense being recorded for SAYE schemes.
Excluding DMS, the effect is to decrease operating profit by 1.7m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Net assets as at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 decreased by 0.1m and 0.2m respectively.

The main differences are: Pension assets are valued at bid value under IAS 19, whereas a mid-market valuation is used under FRS 17 Under FRS 17, pension balances are presented net of deferred tax on the face of the balance sheet.
Under IFRS, these balances are grossed up Death in service liabilities are valued under IAS 19, whereas any potential liability is not recognised under FRS 17: and The effect is to reduce net assets at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 by 3.2m and 2.1m respectively.

Operating profit increased for the year ended 31 December 2004 by 0.3m.
I Dividends In accordance with IAS 10, Events after the Balance Sheet Date, proposed final dividend payments cannot be provided in the year-end balance sheet as, at that date, proposed dividend payments do not represent a liability.

The effect is to increase net assets at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 by 55.5m and 61.1m respectively.

If the conversion rights attached to the bonds outstanding at 31 December 2005 were exercised, 44.6m Ordinary shares would fall to be issued.
Available-for-sale financial assets The Group carried listed and unlisted shares at the lower of cost and realisable value.
Under IAS 39 these are classied as available-for-sale and carried at fair value.
Consequently, the carrying value is increased by 2.5m to 50.7m as at 1 January 2005.
Net gain of 2.5m has been taken directly to equity until disposal or impairment of the investment, when the cumulative unrealised gains and losses would be recycled through the income statement.
Recognition of derivatives at fair value Under UK GAAP, gains and losses from derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are not recognised in earnings or as adjustments to carrying amounts until the underlying hedged transaction matures or occurs.
IAS 39 requires all derivatives to be recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
Consequently, derivative contracts with a positive net fair value of 0.1m have been recognised in the Group balance sheet as at 1 January 2005.
Revenue recognition Under UK GAAP, revenue earned from sportsbetting and internet games was recognised as stakes placed.
Under IFRS, this revenue was recognised as gross win margin.
