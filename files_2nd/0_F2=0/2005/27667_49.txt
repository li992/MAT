Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 continued 26 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The Group utilises the following derivative instruments for both hedging and non-hedging purposes: Foreign currency and interest rate futures are contractual obligations to receive or pay a net amount based on changes in currency rates or interest rates or buy or sell foreign currency or a financial instrument on a future date at a specified price established in an organised financial market.
Since futures contracts are collateralised by cash or marketable securities and changes in the futures contract value are settled daily with the exchange, the credit risk is negligible.
Forward rate agreements are individually negotiated interest rate futures that call for a cash settlement at a future date for the difference between a contracted rate of interest and the current market rate, based on a notional principal amount.
Currency and interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another.
Swaps result in an economic exchange of currencies or interest rates or a combination of both i. e. cross-currency interest rate swaps.
Except for certain currency swaps, no exchange of principal takes place.
The Groups credit risk represents the potential cost to replace the swap contracts if counter parties fail to perform their obligation.
This risk is monitored continuously with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the notional amount of the contracts and the liquidity of the market.
To control the level of credit risk taken, the Group assesses counter parties using the same techniques as for its lending activities.
Foreign currency and interest rate options are contractual agreements under which the writer grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, either to buy a call option or sell a put option at or by a set date or during a set period, a specific amount of a foreign currency or a financial instrument at a predetermined price.
In consideration for the assumption of foreign exchange or interest rate risk, the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
Options may be either exchange-traded or negotiated between the Group and a customer OTC.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on purchased options only, and only to the extent of their carrying amount, which is their fair value.
The notional amounts of certain types of financial instruments provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet, but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Groups exposure to credit or price risks.
The derivative instruments become in-the-money or out-of-the-money as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates or foreign exchange rates relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments on hand, the extent to which instruments are in-the-money or out-of-the-money and, therefore, the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.
Old Mutual plc 138 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 26 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued The following tables provide a detailed breakdown of the contractual or notional amounts and the fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments outstanding at year-end.
These instruments allow the Group and its customers to transfer, modify or reduce their credit, equity market, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
The Group undertakes transactions involving derivative financial instruments with other financial institutions.
Management has established limits commensurate with the credit quality of the institutions with whom it deals, and manages the resulting exposures such that a default by any individual counterparty is unlikely to have a materially adverse impact on the Group.
