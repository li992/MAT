Diageo Annual Report 2005 156 Additional information for shareholders Voting rights Voting at any general meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll is duly demanded.
On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present in person at a general meeting, including the duly authorised representative of a corporate holder of Diageos shares which is not itself a shareholder entitled to vote, has one vote regardless of the number of shares held.
On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every share held by that shareholder.
A poll may be demanded by any of the following: the Chairman of the meeting: at least three shareholders entitled to vote and present in person, by proxy or by duly authorised representative at the meeting: any shareholder or shareholders representing in the aggregate not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting and present in person, by proxy or by duly authorised representative: or any shareholder or shareholders holding shares conferring a right to vote at the meeting on which there have been paid-up sums in the aggregate equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right and present in person, by proxy or by duly authorised representative.
Matters are transacted at general meetings of Diageo by the proposing and passing of three kinds of resolutions: an ordinary resolution, which includes resolutions for the election, re-election and removal of directors, the approval of financial statements, the declaration of final dividends, the appointment or re-appointment of auditors, the increase of authorised share capital or the grant of authority to allot shares: a special resolution, which includes resolutions amending Diageos memorandum and articles of association or relating to certain matters concerning Diageos winding up: and an extraordinary resolution, which includes resolutions modifying the rights of any class of Diageos shares at a meeting of the holders of such class.
An ordinary resolution requires the afrmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast at a meeting at which there is a quorum.
Special and extraordinary resolutions require the afrmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the votes cast at a meeting at which there is a quorum.
The necessary quorum for a meeting of Diageo is a minimum of 10 persons entitled to attend and vote on the business to be transacted, each being a shareholder or a proxy for a shareholder or a duly authorised representative of a corporation which is a shareholder.
In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting is entitled to cast the deciding vote in addition to any other vote he may have.
Liquidation rights In the event of the liquidation of Diageo, after payment of all liabilities and deductions in accordance with English law, the balance of assets available for distribution will be distributed among the holders of ordinary shares according to the amounts paid-up on the shares held by them.
A liquidator may, with the sanction of a special resolution of the shareholders and any other sanction required by the Insolvency Act 1986, divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of Diageos assets.
Alternatively, a liquidator may, upon the adoption of a special resolution of the shareholders, place the assets in whole or in part in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of shareholders, but no shareholder is compelled to accept any assets upon which there is a liability.
Pre-emptive rights and new issues of shares While holders of ordinary shares have no pre-emptive rights under the articles of association, the ability of the directors to cause Diageo to issue shares, securities convertible into shares or rights to shares, otherwise than pursuant to an employee share scheme, is restricted.

Disclosure of interests in Diageos shares There are no provisions in the articles of association whereby persons acquiring, holding or disposing of a certain percentage of Diageos shares are required to make disclosure of their ownership percentage, although there are such requirements under the Companies Act.
The basic disclosure requirement under sections 198 to 211 of the Companies Act imposes upon a person interested in the shares of Diageo a statutory obligation to notify Diageo in writing of details set out in the Companies Act where: a he acquires or ceases to have an interest in shares comprising any class of Diageos issued and voting share capital: and b as a result, either he obtains, or ceases to have: i a material interest in 3% or more of the nominal value of any class of Diageos issued voting share capital: or ii an aggregate interest whether material or not in 10% or more of the nominal value of any class of Diageos issued voting share capital, or the percentage of his interest in Diageos issued voting share capital remains above the relevant level and changes by a whole percentage point or more.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 157 Additional information for shareholders Additional information for shareholders continued A material interest means, broadly, any beneficial interest, including those of a spouse or a child or a step-child, those of a company which is accustomed to act in accordance with the relevant persons instructions or in which one third or more of the votes are controlled by such person and certain other interests set out in the Companies Act, other than those of an investment manager or an operator of a unit trust recognised scheme collective investment scheme open-ended investment company.
The Companies Act sets out particular rules of disclosure where two or more parties have entered into an agreement to acquire interests in shares of a public company, and the agreement imposes obligations restrictions on any such party with respect to the use, retention or disposal of their interests in the shares and an acquisition of shares by a party pursuant to the agreement has taken place.
Under the Companies Act, Diageo may, by notice in writing, require a person that Diageo knows or has reasonable cause to believe is or was during the three years preceding the date of notice interested in Diageos shares to indicate whether or not that is correct and, if that person does or did hold an interest in Diageos shares, to provide certain information as set out in the Companies Act.
The Companies Act further deals with the disclosure by persons of interests in shares or debentures of the companies of which they are directors and certain associated companies.
There are additional disclosure obligations under the Rules Governing Substantial Acquisitions of Shares where a person acquires 15% or more of the voting rights of a listed company or when an acquisition increases his holding of shares or rights over shares so as to increase his voting rights beyond that level by a whole percentage point.
Notication in this case should be to the London Stock Exchange and to Diageo no later than noon on the business day following the date of the acquisition.
The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers also contains strict disclosure requirements with regard to dealings in the securities of an offeror or offeree company on all parties to a takeover and also to their respective associates during the course of an offer period.
General meetings and notices At least 21 days written notice of an annual general meeting is required.
An annual general meeting may be held on short notice provided that all the shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the meeting agree.
Any general meeting which is not an annual general meeting is called an extraordinary general meeting.
At least 14 days written notice of any extraordinary general meeting is required, unless a special resolution or a resolution on which special notice has been given to Diageo is proposed, in which case 21 days written notice is required.
Any extraordinary general meeting may be held on short notice if a majority in number of shareholders, who together hold at least 95% in nominal value of Diageos shares giving a right to attend and vote at such meeting, agree.
Under Diageos articles of association, the annual general meeting of shareholders must be held within 15 months of the preceding annual general meeting and at a time and place determined by the directors.
Variation of rights If, at any time, Diageos share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, either with the consent in writing of the holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the shares of that class or upon the adoption of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.
At every such separate meeting, all of the provisions of the articles of association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that a the quorum is to be the number of persons which must be at least two who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class or, if such quorum is not present on an adjourned meeting, one person who holds shares of the class regardless of the number of shares he holds, b any person present in person or by proxy may demand a poll, and c each shareholder will have one vote per share held in that particular class in the event a poll is taken.
Class rights are deemed not to have been varied by the creation or issue of new shares ranking equally with or subsequent to that class of shares in all respects or by the reduction of the capital paid up on such shares or by the purchase or redemption by Diageo of its own shares in accordance with the Companies Act and the articles of association.
Repurchase of shares Subject to authorisation by shareholder resolution, Diageo may purchase its own shares in accordance with the Companies Act.
Any shares which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, thereby reducing the amount of Diageos issued share capital.
Diageo currently has shareholder authority to buy back up to 305,752,223 ordinary shares during the period up to the Annual General Meeting.
The minimum price which 101 must be paid for such shares is 28 108 pence and the maximum price is an amount equal to 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share for the five preceding business days.
Exchange controls There are currently no UK foreign exchange control restrictions on the payment of dividends to US persons on Diageos ordinary shares or preferred securities or on the conduct of Diageos operations.
There are no restrictions under the companys memorandum and articles of association or under English law that limit the right of non-resident or foreign owners to hold or vote the companys ordinary shares or preferred securities.

This section is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations, published rulings and court decisions, and the laws of the United Kingdom all as currently in effect, as well as on the Conventions Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Tax on Income and Capital Gains entered into force 25 April 1980 the Old Treaty and entered into force on 31 March 2003 the New Treaty.
These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.
The New Treaty is effective in respect of taxes withheld at source for amounts paid or credited on or after 1 May 2003.
Other provisions of the New Treaty took effect on 1 January 2004.
The rules of the Old Treaty remained applicable until these effective dates.
A US holder who would be eligible for the benets of the Old Treaty and is eligible for the benets of the New Treaty, however, may, in certain circumstances, elect to have the Old Treaty apply in its entirety for a period of 12 months after the applicable effective dates of the New Treaty.
Holders of ordinary shares, ADSs or preferred securities are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to the overall tax implications of the New Treaty, including specically the implications of making the above mentioned election.
In addition, this section is based in part upon the representations of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.
In general, and taking into account this assumption, for United States federal income tax purposes and for purposes of the Old Treaty and New Treaty, holders of ADRs evidencing ADSs will be treated as the owner of the shares represented by those ADSs.
Exchanges of shares for ADRs, and ADRs for shares, generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax or to United Kingdom tax.
A US holder is a beneficial owner of ordinary shares, ADSs or preferred securities that is for United States federal income tax purposes: a citizen or resident of the United States: a United States domestic corporation: an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source: or a trust if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over the trusts administration and one or more United States persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
This section is not intended to provide specic advice and no action should be taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon it.
This discussion addresses only United States federal income tax and United Kingdom income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax and stamp taxes.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 159 Additional information for shareholders Additional information for shareholders continued Ordinary shares or ADSs United Kingdom taxation There is no United Kingdom withholding tax on dividends.
A shareholder who is an individual resident for United Kingdom tax purposes in the United Kingdom that receives a dividend from the company will generally be entitled to a tax credit equal to one-ninth of the dividend.
The individual will be taxable on the total of the dividend and the related credit, known as the gross dividend, which will be regarded as the top slice of the individuals income.
The tax credit will, however, be treated as discharging the individuals liability to income tax in respect of the gross dividend, unless and except to the extent that the gross dividend falls above the threshold for the higher rate of income tax, in which case the individual will, to that extent, pay tax on the gross dividend calculated as 32.5% of the gross dividend less the related tax credit.
A shareholder that is a company resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom will not generally be taxable on any dividend it receives in respect of the shares.
A shareholder who is not liable for tax on dividends received on the shares will not be entitled to claim payment of the tax credit in respect of those dividends.
The Old Treaty, if applicable by virtue of an election under the New Treaty, allows an eligible US holder to claim a similar tax credit from the United Kingdom Inland Revenue.
However, it also provides for a notional United Kingdom withholding tax which, in the case of an eligible US holder that owned, directly or indirectly, less than 10% of the voting stock of the company, is set at 15% of the aggregate of the dividend and the credit.
At current rates, the notional withholding tax would eliminate the tax credit payment but no withholding in excess of the tax credit payment would be imposed upon the US holder.
Thus, for example, an eligible US holder that received a dividend of 9 would also be entitled to receive from the United Kingdom Inland Revenue a tax credit of 1 one-ninth of the dividend received, but the entire payment of 1 would be eliminated by the notional United Kingdom withholding tax, which would result in a net distribution, before United States tax, of 9 to the US holder.
Under the New Treaty, an eligible US holder will not be entitled to a tax credit nor be subject to a withholding tax by the United Kingdom.
United States taxation Under the United States federal income tax laws, and subject to the passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, rules discussed below, the gross amount of any dividend paid to a US holder by Diageo in respect of its ordinary shares or ADSs out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for United States federal income tax purposes is subject to United States federal income taxation.
Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder before 1 January 2009 that constitute qualied dividend income will be taxable to the holder at a maximum tax rate of 15% provided that the ordinary shares or ADSs are held for more than 60 days during the 121 day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and the holder meets other holding period requirements.
Dividends paid by Diageo with respect to its ordinary shares or ADSs will be qualied dividend income to US holders that meet the holding period requirement.
US holders that are eligible for the benets of the Old Treaty and have properly led Internal Revenue Form 8833 may include any United Kingdom tax deemed withheld from the dividend payment in this gross amount even though they do not in fact receive it.
Subject to certain limitations, the United Kingdom tax deemed withheld in accordance with the Old Treaty and paid over to the United Kingdom will be creditable against the US holders United States federal income tax liability.
In addition, special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to the maximum 15% tax rate.
Under the New Treaty, a US holder will not be entitled to a United Kingdom tax refund, but also will not be subject to United Kingdom withholding tax.
In that case, the US holder therefore will include in income for United States federal income tax purposes only the amount of the dividend actually received, and the receipt of a dividend will not entitle the US holder to a foreign tax credit.
The dividend must be included in income when the US holder, in the case of shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, receives the dividend, actually or constructively.
The dividend will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to United States corporations in respect of dividends received from other United States corporations.
Dividends will be income from sources outside the United States, but generally will be passive income or financial services income which is treated separately from other types of income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable.
The amount of the dividend distribution that must be included in income of a US holder will be the US dollar value of the pence payments made, determined at the spot United Kingdom sterling US dollar foreign exchange rate on the date the dividend distribution is included in income, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars.
Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange uctuations during the period from the date the dividend payment is included in income to the date the payment is converted into US dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualied dividend income.
The gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.
Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for United States federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the holders basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 160 Additional information for shareholders Taxation of capital gains United Kingdom taxation A citizen or resident of the United States who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom will not be liable for United Kingdom tax on gains realised or accrued on the sale or other disposal of ordinary shares, ADSs or preferred securities unless the ordinary shares or ADSs or preferred securities are held in connection with a trade or business carried on by the holder in the United Kingdom through a United Kingdom branch, agency or a permanent establishment.
A US holder will be liable for United States federal income tax on such gains to the same extent as on any other gains from sale or dispositions of shares or stock.
A US holder who is liable for both United Kingdom and United States tax on a gain on the disposal of ordinary shares, ADSs or preferred securities will generally be entitled, subject to certain limitations, to a credit against the holders United States federal income tax liability for the amount of any United Kingdom tax paid in respect of such gain.
United States taxation Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a US holder who sells or otherwise disposes of ordinary shares, ADSs or preferred securities, will recognise capital gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount that is realised and the tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the ordinary shares, ADSs or preferred securities.
Capital gain of a non-corporate US holder that is recognised on or after 6 May 2003 and before 1 January 2009 is taxed at a maximum rate of 15% where the property is held more than one year.
The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.
PFIC rules Diageo believes that ordinary shares, ADSs and preferred securities should not be treated as stock of a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes, but this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change.
If treated as a PFIC, unless a US holder elects to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to the ordinary shares, ADSs or preferred securities, gain realised on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares, ADSs or preferred securities would in general not be treated as capital gain.
Instead, US holders would be treated as if the holder had realised such gain and certain excess distributions pro-rated over the holders holding period for the ordinary shares, ADSs or preferred securities and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated, together with an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year.
In addition, dividends received from Diageo will not be eligible for the special tax rates applicable to qualied dividend income if Diageo is a PFIC either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year, but instead will be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income.
United Kingdom inheritance tax An ordinary share, ADS or preferred security held by an individual shareholder who is domiciled in the United States for the purposes of the Convention Between the United States and the United Kingdom relating to estate and gift taxes the Convention will not be subject to United Kingdom inheritance tax on the individuals death whether held on the date of death or gifted during the individuals lifetime except in the exceptional case where the ADS or ordinary share is part of the business property of a United Kingdom permanent establishment of the individual or pertains to a United Kingdom xed base of an individual who performs independent personal services.
The Convention generally provides for tax paid in the United Kingdom to be credited against tax payable in the United States and for tax paid in the United States to be credited against any tax payable in the United Kingdom, based on priority rules set forth in the Convention, in a case where an ordinary share, ADS or preferred security is subject both to United Kingdom inheritance tax and to United States federal gift or estate tax.
United Kingdom stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax Stamp duty reserve tax SDRT arises upon the deposit of an underlying ordinary share with the Depositary, generally at the higher rate of 15% of its issue price or, as the case may be, of the consideration for transfer.
The Depositary will pay the SDRT but will recover an amount in respect of such tax from the initial holders of ADSs.
No United Kingdom stamp duty will be payable on the acquisition or transfer of ADSs or preferred securities in practice, provided that the instrument of transfer is not executed in the United Kingdom and remains at all times outside the United Kingdom.
Furthermore, an agreement to transfer ADSs in the form of ADRs or preferred securities will not give rise to a liability to SDRT.
Purchases of ordinary shares will be subject to United Kingdom stamp duty, or SDRT as the case may be, at the rate of 0.5% of the price payable for the ordinary shares at the time of the transfer.
However, where ordinary shares being acquired are transferred direct to the Depositarys nominee, the only charge will generally be the higher SDRT charge of 1.5% of the price payable for the ordinary shares so acquired.
