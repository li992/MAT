Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29 Contingent liabilities i Guarantees In connection with the disposal of the quick service restaurant business, Diageo guaranteed up to $850 million 475 million of external borrowings of Burger King until December 2007.
These loans had an original term of five years, although Diageo and Burger King agreed to structure their arrangements to encourage renancing by Burger King on a non-guaranteed basis prior to the end of five years.
On 13 July 2005, Burger King Corporation BKC renanced its external borrowings on a stand-alone basis, releasing Diageo from its obligations under guarantees relating to that debt.
In connection with the disposal of Pillsbury, Diageo has guaranteed the debt of a third party to the amount of $200 million 112 million until November 2009.
Excluding the guarantee in relation to BKC, at 30 June 2005 the group had given performance guarantees and indemnities to third parties, net of amounts provided in the financial statements, of 170 million.
Subsequent to 30 June 2005, except for the change relating to BKC, there has been no material change in the groups performance guarantees and indemnities.
ii Colombian litigation An action was led on 8 October 2004 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by the Republic of Colombia and a number of its local government entities against Diageo and other spirits companies.
The complaint alleges several causes of action.
Included among the causes of action is a claim that the defendants allegedly violated the Federal RICO Act by facilitating money laundering in Colombia through their supposed involvement in the contraband trade to the detriment of government owned spirits production and distribution businesses.
The complaint was amended on 29 December 2004 to add eight additional local Colombian government entities as plaintiffs.
Diageo intends to vigorously defend itself against this lawsuit.
iii Alcohol advertising litigation At least nine nearly identical putative class actions are pending in state and federal courts in the United States against Diageo, Diageo North America Inc and other Diageo entities, along with a large group of other beverage alcohol manufacturers and importers.
All have been brought by the same counsel.
In each action, the plaintiffs seek to pursue their claims on behalf of parents and guardians of underage drinkers who bought alcohol beverages during the period from 1982 to the present: and in all but one of the actions, plaintiffs seek to pursue claims on behalf of all parents and guardians of children currently under the age of 21.
Plaintiffs allege several causes of action, principally for negligence, unjust enrichment and violation of state consumer fraud statutes.
Some complaints include additional claims for conspiracy, nuisance and other theories of recovery.
The US domestic defendants including Diageo North America Inc have moved or will at an appropriate time move to dismiss each of the actions.
Three motions to dismiss are fully briefed and await decision.
There has been no discovery to date.
iv Other The group has extensive international operations and is defendant in a number of legal proceedings incidental to these operations.
There are a number of legal claims against the group, the outcome of which cannot at present be foreseen.
Save as disclosed above, neither Diageo, nor any member of the Diageo group, is or has been engaged in, nor so far as Diageo is aware is there pending or threatened by or against it, any legal or arbitration proceedings which may have a significant effect on the financial position, results or cash ows of the Diageo group.
