Selected Financial Data The selected consolidated financial data presented below for fiscal 2001 through 2005 and as of the end of each such year, are derived from our audited financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those financial statements and the related notes.
Accordingly, the information from 2003 and thereafter is not comparable to the prior periods.
Our results for the three years prior to fiscal 2004, were negatively affected by a number of factors affecting consumers vacation demands including, among other things, armed conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere, terrorist attacks in the U. S. and elsewhere, the uncertain worldwide economy and adverse publicity surrounding these and other events.
b Effective December 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No.
142, which required us to stop amortizing goodwill as of December 1, 2001.
If amortization of goodwill had not been recorded for fiscal 2001, our adjusted net income would have been $952 million and our adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share would have been $1.63 and $1.61, respectively.
c Our net income for fiscal 2002 and 2001 includes an impairment charge of $20 million and $140 million, respectively, and fiscal 2001 includes a nonoperating net gain of $101 million from the sale of our investment in Airtours plc.
In addition, fiscal 2002 includes a $51 million income tax benefit as a result of an Italian investment incentive.
d Total annual passenger capacity for the period, assuming two passengers per cabin, that we offered for sale, which is computed by multiplying passenger capacity by revenue-producing ship operating days in the period.
e In accordance with cruise industry practice, occupancy percentage is calculated using a denominator of two passengers per cabin even though some cabins can accommodate three or more passengers.
The percentages in excess of 100% indicate that more than two passengers occupied some cabins.
f Percentage of total debt to the sum of total debt and shareholders equity.
