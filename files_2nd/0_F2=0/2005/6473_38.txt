23 Pension funds The Group operates four pension schemes on behalf of its employees.
The Capital Radio plc Pension and Assurance Scheme CRPPAS and the Midlands Radio Group Pension Scheme MRGPS are contributory defined benefit schemes.
Both schemes were closed to new employees from 31 March 1995.
At 31 March 2005, 17 employees of Capital Radio plc and 5 employees of Birmingham Broadcasting Limited respectively were active members of these schemes.
The Border Television Radio Companies Group Pension Plan BTRCGPP is a defined contribution scheme which is now closed to new members but at 31 March 2005 had 13 active members.
All other employees in the Radio Group, and in particular new employees, are eligible to join the Capital Radio Group Personal Pension Plan, which was established on 1 April 1995.
This scheme is a contributory defined contribution arrangement and as at 31 March 2005, 225 employees were active members of this scheme.
The Group makes age related contributions to the scheme.
For both defined benefits schemes, the assets are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with insurance companies.
Independent actuarial valuations are obtained every third year.
Contributions to the pension schemes are made in accordance with advice given by independent qualified actuaries.
