Notes to the Company Financial Statements 30 Accounting policies The following paragraphs summarise the main accounting policies of the Company, which have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys Financial Statements, except as noted below.
"In these Financial Statements the following new standards have been adopted for the first time: FRS 20, ""Share-based payments"": FRS 21, ""Events after the balance sheet date"": the presentation requirements of FRS 25, ""Financial instruments: presentation and disclosure"": and FRS 28, ""Corresponding amounts""."
"The recognition and measurement requirements of FRS 17, ""Retirement benefits"" have also been adopted."
Previously the transitional disclosures of that standard have been followed.
The accounting policies under these new standards are set out below together with an indication of the effects of their adoption.
"FRS 28, ""Corresponding amounts"" has had no material effect as it imposes the same requirements for comparatives as hitherto required by the Companies Act 1985."
The corresponding amounts in these Company Financial Statements are restated in accordance with the new policies.
a Basis of preparation The Company Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
There is no material difference between historical cost profits and those reported in the profit and loss account.
Under Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
86 Marshalls plc Annual Report 2005 a Basis of preparation continued Under FRS 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the consolidated cash flows for all Group companies are included within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
As these Parent Company Financial Statements are presented together with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 and has therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with entities which form part of the Group or investees of the Group qualifying as related parties.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Marshalls plc within which this Company is included are set out on page 46 to 84. b Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment where appropriate.
The Directors consider annually whether a provision against the value of investments on an individual basis is required.
Such provisions are charged in the profit and loss account in the year.
c Pension costs i Defined benefit scheme The Company participates in a Group wide pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the Scheme assets and liabilities of the Scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17, Retirement benefits, accounts for the Scheme as if it were a defined contribution Scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the Scheme in respect of the accounting period.
ii Defined contribution scheme Contributions to the Groups defined contribution Scheme are determined as a percentage of employees earnings and are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
d Cash and liquid resources Cash comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash, at or close to their carrying vaules, or traded in an active market.
Liquid resources comprise term deposits of less than one year.
e Leased assets Elements of plant and machinery are subject to finance leases giving rights approximating to ownership.
Such assets are treated as though they had been purchased outright and are included in tangible fixed assets at a value equal to the total capital payments to be made during the term of the lease.
The total amount of the capital payments outstanding is included in creditors.
The amount included in tangible fixed assets is written off over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the term of the lease.
The rental cost of all operating leases is charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lives of the leases.
"f Deferred taxation Full provision is made for deferred taxation resulting from timing differences, other than those specifically excluded by FRS19, ""Deferred taxation"", between profits computed for taxation purposes and profits stated in the Financial Statements to the extent that there is an obligation to pay more tax in the future as a result of those timing differences."
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
