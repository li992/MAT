3 The balance sheets for 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001 have been amended to reflect the change in accounting for ESOPs in light of the adoption of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts.
The profit and loss account in 2003 has also been amended to reverse the 116 million impairment in the ESOP recognised in this year.
The adoption of UITF 17 Employee share schemes did not have a material impact on the Groups profit and loss account for the four years ended 31 March 2004.
Accordingly, the profit and loss account has not been amended for the adoption of UITF 17.
4 The Group sold its Japanese operations effective 17 February 2005.
Under FRS 3 Reporting Financial Performance, these businesses have been classified as discontinued.
Comparatives for the years ended 31 March 2001 to 31 March 2004 have been adjusted accordingly.
