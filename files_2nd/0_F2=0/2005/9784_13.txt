The results for Financial Services, which was sold during the year, have been disclosed as discontinued operations.
The reporting period for this financial year covers the 52 weeks to 2 April 2005, whereas the prior period covered the 53 weeks to 3 April 2004.
For comparative purposes, the commentary that follows, in so far as it relates to the profit and loss account, is provided on a 52 week basis to 2 April 2005 and 27 March 2004.
2005 2004 2004 52 weeks 52 weeks 53 weeks Group operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items m m m UK Retail 612.1 722.1 762.0 International Retail 65.0 44.2 47.4 Total 677.1 766.3 809.4 UK Retail operating profit before exceptional charges decreased by 15.2% to 612.1m largely as a result of lower sales and higher markdown costs.
Operating costs were broadly unchanged.
Operating profit for those International Retail businesses that trade under the Marks & Spencer brand increased by 45.2% to 60.7m, with strong year-on-year performances in the Republic of Ireland, Hong Kong and franchises.
Operating profit at Kings Super Markets was 4.3m as a result of actions taken last year to improve financial performance.
Exceptional items Operating exceptional items The Group has recorded exceptional operating charges of 91.4m in the year, as follows: Head ofce relocation of 8.8m, which was completed at the end of October.
A further 6.3m of costs in the year in connection with the implementation of the head ofce restructuring programme which was announced at the end of last year.
Lifestore closure costs of 29.3m representing the anticipated cost of closing the Lifestore programme.
These costs include stock provisions, asset write-offs and other property-related costs.
Defence costs of 38.6m represent the costs incurred, primarily for professional advice, in developing and implementing the new business strategy as a consequence of the possible offer from Revival Acquisitions Limited.
Costs of 8.4m have also been incurred in making the necessary changes to the Board.
20 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC Summary financial review continued Non-operating exceptional items The Group successfully completed the sale of Financial Services to HSBC on 9 November 2004.
This resulted in a profit on disposal, after costs, of 208.9m.
Following the disposal of two properties in Germany during the year, we have completed the majority of the actions required to close our Continental European operations and we have released, unutilised, 9.7m of the closure provision which we now anticipate is no longer required.
Interest Net interest expense was 102.3m compared to 44.5m 52 week basis for last year.
The average rate of interest on borrowings during the period was 5.7% last year 5.3%.
Taxation The tax charge reects an effective tax rate for the full year of 28.5% before exceptional charges, compared to 30.1% last year.
The rate is lower than the standard UK tax rate of 30% due to the impact of prior year credits and relief in respect of the exercise of employee share options.
The European Court of Justice heard the Groups group relief claim on 1 February 2005 and their judgement is expected later this year.
No asset has been recognised in respect of this claim.
Shareholder returns and dividends Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the effect of exceptional items, has decreased by 11.3% to 21.9p per share on a 52 week basis, a decrease of 6.4%.
Return on equity was 41.4% compared to 25.2% last year.
A final dividend of 7.5p per share last year 7.1p per share is proposed, making the total dividend for the year 12.1p per share last year 11.5p per share, an increase of 5.2%.
Balance sheet Net assets have decreased by 1,932.6m to 521.4m largely as a result of returning 2.3bn to shareholders by way of a Tender Offer.
Within this, Group capital expenditure was 219.6m and depreciation was 267.3m.
The sale of M&S Money to HSBC resulted in the fide-recognition of 2.6bn of debtors, 1.5bn of creditors and 0.8bn of net debt.
In July 2004, the Group commissioned DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, an External Valuer, to carry out a valuation of the Groups property portfolio.
This valuation was carried out on an existing use value basis for the Groups operational stores and other properties and a market value basis for non-operational properties.
This gave rise to a valuation for the Groups properties of approximately 3.6bn.
Adjusting this valuation for movements in the Groups portfolio since that date gives rise to a surplus over net book value as at 2 April 2005 of approximately 1.3bn.
Had this valuation been incorporated into the Groups balance sheet as at 2 April 2005 then net assets would have increased by 1.3bn to 1.8bn.
Cash ow and nancing The Group generated an operating cash inow for the year of 1,575.4m last year 666.5m.
Within this, the cash inow from continuing operations was 857.5m last year 602.3m.
A major factor in the increase in operating cash ow was the year-on-year net decrease in contributions paid to the UK dened benefit pension scheme of 383.0m, following the one-off injection of 400.0m in March 2004.
The cash outow during the period for capital expenditure was 232.2m last year 428.8m.
During the year, the Group received 117.8m last year 126.2m from the sale of properties, including 115m from the sale of Michael House.
Acquisitions and disposals include a net inow of 351.1m, being proceeds from the sale of Financial Services offset by the acquisition of per una.
Transactions with shareholders dividends, redemption of B shares, the purchase of 635,359,116 ordinary shares by way of a Tender Offer and the issue of new shares under employee share schemes resulted in a cash outow of 2,502.6m last year 310.1m.
After taking into account transactions with shareholders, net debt at the end of the period was 2.1bn, a decrease of 0.1bn, giving rise to gearing of 84.5% last year retail gearing of 44.7% including the net post-retirement liability.
International Financial Reporting Standards For the next financial year, the Group will be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards.
We have identied that the greatest impact on the Group arises from changes in the accounting treatment for property, share-based payments, financial instruments and software.
The Group has restated the results for the period ended 2 April 2005 to reect these changes and a summary of the impact is set out below: 2004 05 UK GAAP IFRS Change Change % Turnover m 7,942.3
