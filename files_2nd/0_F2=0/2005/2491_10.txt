The Group is a single product business providing cigarettes and other tobacco products.
While the Group has clearly differentiated brands, global segmentation between a wide portfolio of brands is not part of the regular internally reported financial information.
It is not feasible to segment global results by brand without a high degree of estimation, especially given that geographically the same operations are used to produce the different brands, and brand results are managed in the context of the geographic markets in which they are sold.
The prices agreed between Group companies for intragroup sales of materials, manufactured goods, charges for royalties, commissions, services and fees, are based on normal commercial practices which would apply between independent businesses.
Royalty income, less related expenditure, is included in the region in which the licensor is based.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are items in the profit from operations and the Group share of the post-tax results of associates which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, are relevant to an understanding of the Groups financial performance.
These items are separately disclosed as memorandum information on the face of the income statement and in the segmental analyses.
Contingent liabilities Subsidiaries and associate companies are defendants in tobacco-related litigation.
Provision for this litigation would be made at such time as an unfavourable outcome became probable and the amount could be reasonably estimated.
The Group records its external legal fees and other external defence costs for tobacco-related litigation as these costs fall due.
Repurchase of share capital When share capital is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares which are not cancelled, or shares purchased for the Employee Share Ownership Trusts, are classied as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.

On 23 December 2003, the Group completed the acquisition of Ente Tabacchi Italiani S. p. A. ETI, Italys state tobacco company.
On 29 December 2004, the Group sold Etinera S. p. A. Etinera, the distribution business of the Italian subsidiary, for 590 million page 81 note 26.
After allocating the relevant portion of the goodwill on the ETI acquisition to Etinera, there was no gain or loss on the disposal.
In 2004, the Group sold two non-current asset investments, its 20 per cent stake in Lakson Tobacco Company in Pakistan and Bollor Investissement S. A. in France.
The total proceeds were 66 million, resulting in a gain on disposal of 38 million included in other operating income in the profit from operations.
In April 2005, the Group sold its Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut trademarks in Malta and Cyprus to Gallaher Group plc Gallaher, together with the Silk Cut trademark in Lithuania, resulting in a gain on disposal of 68 million included in other operating income in the profit from operations.
The transactions are in accordance with contracts of 1993 and 1994 in which Gallaher agreed to acquire these trademarks in European Union states and the recent accession of Malta, Cyprus and Lithuania necessitated the sale.
The Group ceased to be the controlling company of British American Racing Holdings Ltd. BAR on 8 December 2004 when BAR went into administration.
The Group consequently ceased to consolidate BAR from that date.
On 7 January 2005, BARH Ltd. BARH, a newly formed joint venture between British American Tobacco and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. acquired the BAR business.
On 4 October 2005, the Group announced that it had agreed the sale of its 55 per cent shareholding in BARH to Honda and the sale was completed on 20 December 2005.
For the period from 7 January 2005 to 20 December 2005, BARH has been equity accounted, reecting shared control with Honda.
As a result of these transactions there is a gain of 5 million, included in other operating income in the profit from operations, which comprised: m m Net liabilities of BAR 106 Investment in BARH 79 Share of net liabilities of BARH acquired 3 82 Termination and warranty costs arising from joint venture agreement with Honda 5 Purchase of additional shares in BAR 1 Exchange differences recycled from translation reserves 1 Proportion of 2005 and 2006 Lucky Strike sponsorship costs see below 23 Proceeds of sale of shares in BARH to Honda 8 Share of net liabilities of BARH disposed 3 11 5 As part of the above transactions the Group has a funding obligation to BARH through to the end of 2006.

As described on page 81 note 26, the US domestic business ceased to be a subsidiary of the Group at the end of July 2004.
The other operating expenses in the profit from operations in 2004 include 303 million in respect of these costs for the period to 30 July 2004.

Following the combination of Brown & Williamson with R. J. Reynolds as described on page 81 note 26, the new company, Reynolds American Inc. RAI, incurred restructuring costs in integrating the two businesses.
In 2004, the Groups share of these amounted to 63 million net of tax, mainly in relation to asset write-downs and staff costs.
The contribution from RAI also included a 49 million net of tax impairment charge, following the implementation of a review of brand strategies resulting from the combination of R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson and a 49 million exceptional tax credit arising from tax recoveries.
In 2005, RAI incurred further restructuring costs and a one-off charge related to the stabilisation inventory pool losses associated with the US tobacco quota buy-out programme.
The Groups share net of tax amounted to 13 million and 12 million respectively.
In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2005, RAI benefited from the favourable resolution of tax matters of which the Groups share was 31 million, and also modied the previously anticipated level of support between certain brands and the projected net sales of certain brands, resulting in a brand impairment charge of which the Groups share amounted to 29 million net of tax.
In 2005, the contribution from ITC Limited in India included a benefit of 26 million net of tax, principally related to the write back of provisions for taxes offset by the impairment of a non-current investment.

For the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is increased to 2,112 million 2004: 2,156 million to reect the potential dilutive effect of employee share schemes and, up to their redemption on 3 June 2004, the convertible redeemable preference shares.
The earnings are correspondingly adjusted to the amount of earnings prior to charging dividends and the amortisation of discount on the convertible redeemable preference shares.

In addition, certain exchange differences included in reserve movements under UK GAAP are required to be included in the net finance costs in the income statement under current IFRS.
As both these items are particularly subject to exchange rate movements in a period, they can be a volatile element of reported income, and especially of net finance costs, and one which does not always reect an economic gain or loss for the Group.
Consequently, in calculating the adjusted earnings per share, the following items are excluded: a 8 million gain relating to derivatives for which hedge accounting was obtained during 2005: b 11 million relating to exchange gains in net finance costs where there is a compensating exchange loss reected in differences in exchange taken directly to changes in total equity: and c 4 million gain 2004: 4 million loss relating to exchange in net finance costs which, when the revised IAS21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates is endorsed by the EU as expected in 2006, will be taken directly to changes in total equity page 93 note 31.

Impairment testing for intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill Goodwill of 7,887 million 2004: 7,607 million included in intangible assets in the balance sheet is mainly the result of the following acquisitions: Rothmans Group 4,206 million 2004: 4,179 million : Imperial Tobacco Canada 2,004 million 2004: 1,751 million : and ETI Italy 1,135 million 2004: 1,169 million.
The principal allocations of goodwill in the Rothmans acquisition are to the cash generating units of Continental Europe and South Africa, with the remainder mainly relating to operations in the domestic and export market in the United Kingdom and operations in Asia-Pacic.
qxd 16 3 06 6:59 pm Page 48 48 British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2005 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS continued 9 Intangible assets continued Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to 12 individual cash-generating units four in Europe, one in Africa and Middle East, three in Asia-Pacic, two in Latin America and two in America-Pacic.
The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units of South Africa 1,017 million, 2004: 1,024 million, Continental Europe 1,040 million, 2004: 1,043 million, Canada 2,004 million, 2004: 1,751 million and Italy 1,141 million, 2004: 1,175 million are considered significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
The recoverable amount of all cash-generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis.
The key assumptions for the recoverable amount of all units are the long term growth rate and the discount rate.
The long term growth rate is a nominal rate used purely for the impairment testing of goodwill under IAS36 Impairment of Assets and does not reect long term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.
The discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which specic market-related premium adjustments are made.
These assumptions have been applied to the individual cash ows of each unit as compiled by local management in the different markets.
The valuation uses cash ow projections based on the current years expected results and detailed financial budgets approved by management covering a two year period, with cash ow beyond two years extrapolated by a nominal growth rate of 3 per cent per annum.
This long term growth rate used does not exceed the expected long term average growth rate for the markets in which the cash-generating units operate.
In some instances, such as recent acquisitions or start-up ventures, the valuation is expanded to reect the medium term plan of management, spanning five years or beyond, with the cash ow beyond these years extrapolated by the growth rate of 3 per cent, as above.
Pre-tax discount rates of between 8.1 per cent and 15.7 per cent were used, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, together with any premium applicable for country area ination and economical and political risks.
The pre-tax discount rates used for the cash-generating units which are significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill are 12.1 per cent for South Africa, 9.8 per cent for Continental Europe, 11.0 per cent for Canada and 10.7 per cent for Italy.
No impairment charges were recognised in 2005 2004: nil.
The amounts at risk if discounted cash ows per cash-generating unit should fall by 5 per cent is 1 million, and 8 million should the cash ow fall by 10 per cent.

In addition to US litigation involving Group companies, which is covered by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company RJRT indemnity referred to in note 30, Reynolds American Inc. RAI group companies are named in litigation which do not involve Group companies.
While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse verdict, it is not impossible that the results of operations or cash ows of RAI in particular quarterly or annual periods could be materially affected by this and by the final outcome of any particular litigation.
However, having regard to the contingent liability disclosures on litigation made by RAI in its public financial reports, the Directors are satisfied with the carrying value included above for RAI.

On 21 October 2005, the Group announced the exercise of its pre-emption rights over shares in Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni AS STK and the transaction was completed on 12 December 2005.
As a result, the Groups shareholding in STK has increased from 26.6 per cent to 32.3 per cent, at a purchase price of 95 million, giving rise to 69 million of goodwill which, after taking into account differences on exchange, is included at 71 million in non-current assets.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
The majority of employees belong to dened benefit schemes, most of which are funded externally, although the Group also operates a number of dened contribution schemes.
The liabilities arising in the dened benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualied actuaries, using the projected unit method.
All schemes are formally valued at least every three years.
The principal pension schemes are in the UK, Germany, Canada, Netherlands and Switzerland.
Together these schemes account for over 88 per cent of the total obligations of the Groups dened benefit schemes.
In addition, the Group operates significant schemes in Canada which provide employees with certain other retirement benets such as healthcare.
The liabilities in respect of these benets are also assessed by qualied independent actuaries, applying the projected unit method.

In addition, charges of 10 million were recognised in 2004 in the costs of the Reynolds American Inc. transaction see page 81 note 26.
The reduction in the amounts recognised in the income statement in 2005 is principally due to the disposal of the US domestic business as part of the Reynolds American transaction in 2004 and the change in the impact of costs related to the restructurings noted above.

For the remaining pension schemes, typical assumptions were that real salary increases will be from 2 per cent to 4 per cent per annum and discount rates will be from 2 per cent to 5 per cent above ination.
Pension increases, where allowed for, were generally assumed to be in line with ination.

For the remaining pension schemes, typical assumptions were that real salary increases will be from 1 per cent to 3 per cent per annum and discount rates from 2 per cent to 5 per cent above ination.
Mortality assumptions are subject to regular review.
In the UK for post-retirement mortality assumptions at 31 December 2005, the table PA92 B 1965 rated up two years for active and deferred members and PA92 B 1935 tables rated up four years for current pensioners, all with the medium cohort effect, have been used.
In the UK, for assumptions at 31 December 2004, PA90 tables rated down two years have been used.
In Germany, Heubeck tables 2005G were used for 31 December 2005, whereas Heubeck tables 1998 were used for 31 December 2004.
In Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland the same tables were used for both years: in Canada, UP94 tables, in the Netherlands, GBM V 1995-2000 tables, with an age setback of two years, and EVK 2000 mortality tables in Switzerland.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 18 million 2004: 36 million of such losses, as realisation of the related tax benefit is probable.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of unused income tax losses of 69 million 2004: 146 million have no expiry date, and unused income tax losses of 40 million 2004: 56 million expire after five years.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of unused capital tax losses of 10 million 2004: 10 million have no expiry date.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences of 179 million 2004: 111 million and unused tax credits of 133 million 2004: 147 million.
10 million 2004: 4 million of these unrecognised deferred tax assets expire after five years, whilst the remainder have no expiry period.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 5 billion 2004: 6 billion.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Management of financial risks One of the principal responsibilities of Treasury is to manage the financial risk arising from the Groups underlying operations.
Specically, Treasury manages, within an overall policy framework, the Groups exposure to funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty risks.
Derivative contracts are only entered into to facilitate the management of these risks.
The Groups management of specic risks is dealt with as follows: Liquidity risk It is the policy of the Group to maximise financial exibility and minimise renancing risk by issuing debt with a range of maturities, generally matching the projected cash ows of the Group, and obtaining this nancing from a wide range of providers.
Furthermore, it is the policy that short term sources of funds including drawings under US dollar and euro commercial paper programmes are backed by undrawn committed lines of credit and cash.
During 2005, the Groups central banking facility was renewed for an increased amount of 1.75 billion for a term of five years with two additional one year extension options and on signicantly improved terms.
The Group continues to target investment-grade credit ratings: as at end 2005, the ratings from Moodys and S&P were Baa 1 BBB end 2004: Baa 1 BBB.
The strength of the ratings has underpinned the success of the debt issuance during 2004 and 2005 and the Group continues to enjoy full access to the debt capital markets.
Subsidiary companies are funded by share capital and retained earnings, loans from the central finance companies on commercial terms, or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies.
All contractual borrowing covenants have been met and none of them are expected to inhibit the Groups operations or funding plans.
Currency risk The Group is subject to exposure on the translation of the net assets of foreign currency subsidiaries and associates into its reporting currency, sterling.
The Groups primary balance sheet translation exposures are to the US dollar, Canadian dollar, euro and South African rand.
These exposures are kept under continuous review and the Groups policy is to minimise all balance sheet translation exposure where it is practicable and cost effective to do so.
The exposures are managed by matching currency assets with currency borrowings.
At 31 December 2005, the currency prole of the Groups gross debt, after taking into account derivative contracts, was 26 2004: 20 per cent US dollar, 44 2004: 47 per cent euro, 5 2004: 5 per cent Canadian dollar, 12 2004: 12 per cent sterling, 5 2004: 4 per cent Australian dollar and 8 2004: 12 per cent other currencies.
The Group faces currency exposures arising from the translation of profits earned in foreign currency subsidiaries and associates: these exposures are not normally hedged.
Exposures also arise from: i foreign currency denominated trading transactions undertaken by subsidiaries.
These exposures comprise committed and highly probable forecast, sales and purchases, which are netted and offset wherever possible.
The remaining exposures are hedged within the Treasury policies and procedures with forward foreign exchange contracts and options which are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk of the identied future transactions: and BT2200 Report back.
qxd 14 3 06 1:02 pm Page 75 Directors Report and Accounts 2005 British American Tobacco 75 22 Financial instruments continued ii forecast dividend ows from subsidiaries to the centre.
To ensure cash ow certainty the Group hedges such ows using forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges of the foreign exchange risk arising from the investments in these subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk The objectives of the Groups interest rate risk management policy are to lessen the impact of adverse interest rate movements on the earnings, cash ow and economic value of the Group and to safeguard against any possible breach of its financial covenants.
Additional objectives are to minimise the cost of hedging and the associated counterparty risk.
In order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group maintains both oating rate and xed rate debt.
The desired ratio of xed to variable rate debt is determined as a result of regular reviews of market conditions and strategy by Treasury and the board of the main central finance company.
At 31 December 2005, the ratio of oating to xed rate borrowings was 55:45 2004: 52:48.
Underlying borrowings are arranged on both a xed rate and a oating rate basis and, where appropriate, the Group uses derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, to vary the xed and oating mix.
The interest rate prole of liquid assets is taken into account in determining the net interest rate exposure.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
Subsidiaries have policies in place requiring appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from bank counterparties.
Credit risk is managed on a global basis by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty, taking into account its credit rating.
The credit ratings of counterparties are reviewed regularly.
Price risk The Group is exposed to equity price risk on equity investments held by the Group.
These are classied on the consolidated balance sheet as available-for-sale investments.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
Hedge accounting In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis.
This effectiveness testing is reperformed periodically to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Fair value estimation Derivative financial instruments The fair values of derivatives are determined based on market data primarily yield curves, implied volatilities and exchange rates to calculate the present value of all estimated ows associated with each derivative at the balance sheet date.
Other financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and liabilities with maturities of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
For financial assets and liabilities with maturities of more than one year, fair values are based on quoted market prices, market prices of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date or discounted cash ow analysis.
Additional disclosures on financial instruments are included in the relevant notes on these accounts dealing with the specic financial assets or financial liabilities.
As explained in the accounting policies on page 33, IAS32 and IAS39, which deal with financial instruments, are being applied from 1 January 2005.
Therefore the relevant notes provide the additional disclosures required by IAS32 and IAS39 for 31 December 2005 and, to provide comparable gures, restated information as at 1 January 2005.
The information below for the year ended 31 December 2004 provides financial instrument disclosure in line with UK GAAP as IAS32 and IAS39 are not applicable to reporting on 2004.

Floating rate financial liabilities principally bear interest at rates based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
The average interest rate for total borrowings is estimated to be 5 per cent.
Non-interest bearing financial liabilities comprise non-interest bearing borrowings and certain other payables due after more than one year.
These borrowings and other payables include 36 million which have no xed repayment date and the weighted average period until maturity for the remainder is 2.5 years.
The maturity prole of borrowings is shown on page 64 note 20.
In addition, oating rate financial liabilities include long term other payables of 1 million which have no xed date of repayment.

Summary of methods and assumptions Interest rate swaps, caps, collars, The fair value is based on discounted cash ow analysis or market price of cross-currency swaps and forward comparable instruments at the balance sheet date adjusted where relevant to foreign currency contracts exclude interest receivable and payable.
Fixed rate borrowings and loans The fair value is based on quoted market prices, market prices of comparable and receivables instruments at the balance sheet date or discounted cash ow analysis.
Available-for-sale investments The fair value is based on quoted market prices, market prices of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date or discounted cash ow analysis.
Hedges The Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk Using interest and cross-currency swaps and interest rate agreements such as caps and collars.
Currency risk Using cross-currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage the currency risk on borrowings in order to hedge net investments overseas.
Forward foreign currency contracts are also used for currency exposures on unsettled trading transactions and future sales.

The last grant under the Share Option Scheme was made in March 2004.
Eligible individuals are now entitled to participate in the Long Term Incentive Plan and or Deferred Share Bonus Scheme.
Market condition features were incorporated into the Monte-Carlo models for the total shareholder return elements of the Long Term Incentive Plan, in determining fair value at grant date.
Assumptions used in these models were as follows: 2005 2004 % % Average share price volatility FTSE 100 comparator group 34 38 Average share price volatility FMCG comparator group 26 32 Average correlation FTSE 100 comparator group 24 23 Average correlation FMCG comparator group 16 15 The expected British American Tobacco p. l. c. share price volatility was determined taking account of the daily share price movements over a five year period.
The respective FMCG and FTSE 100 share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the same periods.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions, forfeiture and historical experience.
The risk free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the yield from the last two declared dividends divided by the grant share price.
For grants containing earnings per share performance conditions, the payout calculation is based on the average of expectations published in analysts forecasts.
Other equity share-based payment arrangements other than share options Details of the movements of other equity share-based payment arrangements during the year ended 31 December 2005, covering the Deferred Share Bonus, Share Reward and Share Participation Schemes, were as follows: 2005 2004 Number of shares Number of shares Outstanding at start of year 7,284,592 7,615,935 Granted during the period 2,310,273 2,726,346 Exercised during the period 2,461,386 2,979,889 Forfeited during the period 132,208 77,800 Outstanding at end of year 7,001,271 7,284,592 Exercisable at end of year 643,825 633,797 The shares outstanding for the year ended 31 December 2005 had a weighted average contractual life of 6.1 years 2004: 6.0 years.

The Group, through B&W, owns approximately 42 per cent of the outstanding common stock of RAI.
As a result of the Business Combination: a B&W discontinued the active conduct of any tobacco business in the US: b B&W contributed to RJRT all of its assets other than the capital stock of certain subsidiaries engaged in non-US businesses and other limited categories of assets: c RJRT assumed all liabilities of B&W except liabilities to the extent relating to businesses and assets not contributed by B&W to RJRT and other limited categories of liabilities and contributed subsidiaries or otherwise to the extent related to B&Ws tobacco business as conducted in the US on or prior to 30 July 2004: and, d RJRT agreed to indemnify B&W and each of its afliates other than RAI and its subsidiaries against, among other matters, all losses, liabilities, damages, expenses, judgements, attorneys fees, etc, to the extent relating to or arising from such assumed liabilities or the assets contributed by B&W to RJRT the RJRT indemnification.
The scope of the RJRT indemnification includes all expenses and contingent liabilities in connection with litigation to the extent relating to or arising from B&Ws US tobacco business as conducted on or prior to 30 July 2004, including smoking and health tobacco litigation, whether the litigation is commenced before or after 30 July 2004 the tobacco litigation.
Pursuant to the terms of the RJRT indemnification, RJRT is liable for any possible judgements, the posting of appeal bonds or security, and all other expenses of and responsibility for managing the defence of the tobacco litigation.
RJRT has assumed control of the defence of the tobacco litigation involving B&W and RJRT is also a party in most but not all of the same cases.
Accordingly, RJRT uses or plans to use the same law rm or rms to represent both B&W and RJRT in any single or similar case except in certain limited circumstances as RJRTs interests are typically aligned with B&Ws interests, and RJRT has substantial experience in managing recognised external legal counsel in defending tobacco litigation, and external counsel have independent professional responsibilities to represent the interests of B&W.
In addition, in accordance with the terms of the RJRT indemnification, afliates of B&W have retained control of the defence in certain tobacco litigation cases with respect to which such afliates are entitled to indemnification.
US litigation The total number of US product liability cases pending at year end involving B&W and other Group companies was approximately 3,810 2004: 3,896.
UK-based Group companies have been named as co-defendants in some 965 of those cases 2004: 1,026.
Only perhaps a dozen cases are likely to come to trial in 2006, some involving amounts ranging possibly into the hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars.
Since many of these pending cases seek unspecified damages, it is not possible to quantify the total amounts being claimed, but the aggregate amounts involved in such litigation are significant.
The cases fall into four broad categories: a Medical reimbursement cases These civil actions seek to recover amounts spent by government entities and other third party providers on healthcare and welfare costs claimed to result from illnesses associated with smoking.
As at 31 December 2005, a reimbursement suit was pending against B&W and other Group companies by an Indian tribe.
The vast majority of other such cases have been dismissed on legal grounds.
Based on somewhat different theories of claim are two non-governmental medical reimbursement cases.
One third party reimbursement case against B&W and other Group companies is ongoing City of St Louis in which more than 60 public and non-profit hospitals in Missouri seek reimbursement of past and future alleged smoking-related healthcare costs.
In the United Seniors Association Inc. case, the defendants led a motion to dismiss or transfer the case on 24 October 2005.
qxd 16 3 06 7:00 pm Page 89 Directors Report and Accounts 2005 British American Tobacco 89 30 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments continued b Class actions As at 31 December 2005, B&W was named as a defendant in some 15 2004: 14 separate actions attempting to assert claims on behalf of classes of persons allegedly injured or nancially impacted through smoking or where classes of tobacco claimant have been certied.
Even if the classes remain certied and the possibility of class-based liability is eventually established, it is likely that individual trials will still be necessary to resolve any actual claims.
Class-action suits have been led in a number of states against individual cigarette manufacturers and their parent corporations, alleging that the use of the terms lights and ultralights constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices.
A class action complaint Schwab, formerly known as McLaughlin was led in The US District Court for the Eastern District of New York on 11 May 2004 against B&W and other Group companies.
The complaint challenges the practices of the defendants with respect to the marketing, advertising, promotion and sale of light cigarettes.
The plaintiffs seek certication of a class of all US residents who purchased light cigarettes marketed, advertised, promoted and sold by the defendants and whose claims relate to the light cigarette fraud.
The court has not yet ruled on the class certication issue.
The judge has recently issued an order in favour of the plaintiffs allowing what is known as uid recovery.
This means that plaintiffs intend to prove the defendants liability to the class on an aggregate basis and to distribute the total damages among individual class members through a proof of claim procedure.
The defendants are seeking an immediate appeal of this matter and, if allowed to appeal, this will considerably delay any trial.
Other types of class-action suits assert claims on behalf of classes of individuals who claim to be addicted, injured or at greater risk of injury by the use of tobacco or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, or the legal survivors of such persons.
In Engle Florida, one jury awarded a total of US$12.7 million to three class representatives and in a later stage of this three phase trial process, a jury assessed US$17.6 billion in punitive damages against B&W.
In November 2000, B&W posted a surety bond in the amount of US$100 million the amount required by Florida law to stay execution of this punitive damages award.
On 21 May 2003, the intermediate appellate court reversed the trial courts judgement and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to decertify the class.
On 16 July 2003, the plaintiffs led a motion for rehearing which was denied on 22 September 2003.
On 12 May 2004, the Florida Supreme Court agreed to review this case.
Oral argument was held on 3 November 2004 and a decision is still awaited.
In the first phase three trial of an individual Engle class member Lukacs, the jury awarded the plaintiff US$37.5 million in compensatory damages B&Ws share: US$8.4 million.
On 1 April 2003, the jury award was reduced to US$25.125 million B&Ws share: US$5.65 million but no final judgement will be entered until the Engle appeal is resolved.
Therefore the time to appeal this case has not yet begun to run.
In a Louisiana medical monitoring case brought on behalf of Louisiana smokers Scott, on 28 July 2003, the jury returned a verdict in favour of the defendants on the medical monitoring claim but made findings against the defendants with respect to claims relating to fraud, conspiracy, marketing to minors and smoking cessation.
On 21 May 2004, the jury returned a verdict in the amount of US$591 million on the classs claim for a smoking cessation programme.
On 1 July 2004, the court upheld the jurys verdict and entered final judgement.
On 29 September 2004, the defendants posted a US$50 million bond legislation in Louisiana limits the amount of a bond to prevent execution upon such a judgement to US$50 million collectively for signatories to the MSA.
RJRT posted US$25 million i. e. the portions for RJRT and B&W towards the bond.
The defendants opening appellate brief was led on 23 May 2005 and the plaintiffs opening appellate brief was led on 27 July 2005.
The defendants reply was led on 8 August 2005.
Oral argument has not been scheduled.
A federal judge in New York certied a nationwide  class Simon II in September 2002.
The defendants sought reconsideration of the certication ruling, which was denied on 25 October 2002.
On 14 February 2003, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted the defendants petition to review the class certication decision.
Oral argument was heard on 20 November 2003.
On application by the plaintiffs the case is in the process of being dismissed.
qxd 14 3 06 1:02 pm Page 90 90 British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2005 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS continued 30 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments continued c Individual cases Approximately 3,767 individual cases were pending against B&W at 31 December 2005 2004: 3,867 led by or on behalf of individuals in which it is contended that diseases or deaths have been caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ETS.
Of these cases: a approximately two-thirds are ETS cases brought by ight attendants who were members of a class action Broin that was settled on terms that allow compensatory but not punitive damages claims by class members: b approximately one-quarter of the individual cases against B&W are cases brought in consolidated proceedings in West Virginia in which B.
A. T Industries p. l. c. is also involved: and c only about 10 per cent are cases led by other individuals.
Of the cases that went to trial or were decided or remained on appeal during 2005, several resulted in verdicts against B&W.
In May 2003, an Arkansas jury Boerner awarded US$4.025 million in compensatory damages and US$15 million in punitive damages against B&W.
This decision was appealed against and on 7 January 2005, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld the first instance compensatory damages award of US$4.025 million and reduced the punitive damages award to US$5 million.
The judgement was satisfied in February 2005.
In November 2003, a Missouri jury Thompson awarded US$210,000 damages against B&W.
A notice of appeal was led on 8 March 2004.
Oral argument occurred in November 2005.
In December 2003, a New York jury Frankson awarded US$350,000 compensatory damages against B&W and two industry organisations.
In January 2004, the same jury awarded US$20 million punitive damages.
On 22 June 2004, the trial judge granted a new trial unless the parties agree to an increase in compensatory damages to US$500,000 and a decrease in punitive damages to US$5 million, of which US$4 million would be assigned to B&W.
On 25 January 2005, B&W noticed an appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of New York.
B&Ws opening brief was led on 22 September 2005.
Brieng is not yet complete.
In one of the Broin ight attendant cases French, a 2002 jury award of US$5.5 million in compensatory damages against all the defendants, including B&W, was subsequently reduced to US$500,000 of which US$123,500 was assigned to RJRT and US$82,000 to B&W.
The allocation of damages between the defendants was reversed on appeal on 22 December 2004 and the trial court was instructed to enter a judgement nding the defendants jointly and severally liable for the plaintiffs injuries.
On 14 January 2005, the defendants led a petition for a rehearing, which was rejected on 13 April 2005.
B&Ws share of the judgement was paid on 6 December 2005.
On 1 February 2005, a Missouri jury Smith awarded US$500,000 in compensatory damages against B&W and then, on 2 February 2005, awarded US$20 million in punitive damages, also against B&W.
On 10 March 2005, B&W led for a motion for judgement, or in the alternative, for a new trial.
On 23 May 2005, the trial judge denied these motions.
B&Ws opening brief is due on 30 March 2006. d Other claims As at 31 December 2005, one 2004: two case was pending against B&W on behalf of asbestos companies.
Those companies seek reimbursement for costs and judgements paid in litigation brought by third parties against them.
These companies claim that, but for the smoking of the claimants, their damages would have been less.
The contribution claims in five separate cases have been dismissed, leaving the cases pending as to the claims of the individual plaintiffs only.
As at 31 December 2005, B&W was named as defendant in two 2004: three US cases brought by foreign government entities Sao Paulo and Panama seeking reimbursement of medical costs which they incurred for treatment for persons in their own countries who are alleged to have smoked imported cigarettes, including those manufactured by B&W.
UK-based Group companies As at 31 December 2005, B.
A. T Industries p. l. c. was named as a co-defendant in the US in one class action and in the consolidated proceedings of around 1,000 individual cases in West Virginia.
It is contesting the jurisdiction of the US courts since it is a holding company not transacting business in the US.
A. T Industries p. l. c. has successfully contested jurisdiction in some 35 cases prior to trial.
In the balance of these cases, there has been no adverse ruling on the issue of jurisdiction afrmed on the merits through appeal.
Some 216 US plaintiffs have voluntarily agreed to drop B.
A. T Industries p. l. c. or substitute the subsidiary Group company British American Tobacco Investments Limited formerly called BritishAmerican Tobacco Company Limited as a co-defendant.
In the Schwab case mentioned previously, B.
A. T Industries p. l. c. has been substituted for British American Tobacco p. l. c. as a defendant.
British American Tobacco Investments Limited has been served in one asbestos case and one reimbursement case as well as the Department of Justice case see below, two class actions and three individual actions.
qxd 14 3 06 1:02 pm Page 91 Directors Report and Accounts 2005 British American Tobacco 91 30 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments continued Conduct based claims On 22 September 1999, the US Department of Justice brought an action in the US District Court for the District of Columbia against various industry members, including R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and B&W.
British American Tobacco Investments Limited is also a co-defendant in the action.
The Government sought to recover federal funds expended in providing healthcare to smokers who have developed diseases and injuries alleged to be smoking-related, and, in addition, seeks, pursuant to the federal Racketeer Inuenced and Corrupt Organizations RICO Act, disgorgement of profits the Government contends were earned as a consequence of a RICO racketeering enterprise.
On 28 September 2000, the portion of the claim which sought recovery of federal funds expended in providing healthcare to smokers who have developed diseases and injuries alleged to be smoking-related was dismissed.
The bench non-jury trial of the RICO portion of the claim began on 21 September 2004 and was completed in June 2005.
On 17 November 2004, the Washington DC Circuit Court of Appeals heard an appeal by the defendants against an earlier District Court decision that disgorgement of profits is an appropriate remedy to the RICO violations alleged by the Government.
On 4 February 2005, the Court of Appeals allowed the appeal, ruling that the Government could not claim disgorgement of profits.
The Government appealed this decision.
On 17 October 2005, the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by the US Government in respect of the claim for disgorgement of US$280 billion of past profits from the US tobacco industry.
Judgement is awaited in the case and is not expected before Spring 2006.
Various departments of the Republic of Colombia brought actions against various tobacco companies including B&W and other Group companies alleging that the defendants engaged in cigarette smuggling and money laundering in their territories.
Each of these actions seeks compensatory, punitive and treble damages.
The defendants motion to dismiss the complaint was granted in 2002 and the plaintiffs appealed.
The dismissal of the claims was afrmed on 14 January 2004, but on 13 April 2004, the plaintiffs petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.
This case was decided on 9 January 2006 when the United States Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs a writ of certiorari.
The plaintiffs have threatened fresh proceedings that allege money laundering.
A class action complaint Daric Smith was led in the Kansas District Court in 2000, in respect of price xing allegations against a number of tobacco companies including B&W and British American Tobacco Investments Limited.
An Amended Complaint was led in March 2001, alleging that the tobacco company defendants conspired together to x, maintain, raise or stabilise the price of cigarettes in Kansas.
The plaintiffs claim they consequently paid higher prices for cigarettes than they would have done in the absence of the conspiracy.
They seek injunctive relief and damages in respect of the sums paid for cigarettes and also seek triple damages under the relevant Kansas statute.
The discovery phase of the litigation is ongoing.
Product liability outside the US At year end, active claims against Group companies existed in 19 countries outside the US but the only countries with more than five active claims were Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.
As at 31 December 2005, there were some 1,097 2004: 1,050 pending individual cases in Italy.
Some 1,077 2004: 1,029 of these cases are pending before Justices of the Peace courts and relate to light cigarettes.
The plaintiffs in these cases claim that the word lights is misleading and has induced them to switch to light brands and or induced them not to give up smoking altogether.
Because of the type of court, the most that any individual plaintiff can recover is 1,033.
In recent months, 142 of these cases have been suspended or decisions given in favour of British American Tobacco Italia S. p. A.
There are around 20 smoking and health cases led by or on behalf of individuals in which it is contended that diseases or deaths have been caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ETS.
There are pending healthcare cost recoupment cases in France, Spain and Israel.
All of these cases are at the appellate stage of the process.
In both France and Spain the court decisions to date have been in favour of the tobacco industry.
In Israel, the industry is seeking an appeal at the Israeli Supreme Court to reverse the decision at first instance that permits Clalit, a healthcare fund, to pursue their healthcare costs recoupment claim seeking approximately US$1.6 billion in damages and injunctive relief.
The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld the constitutionality of the British Columbian Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act of 2001.
The case will now proceed against the Canadian defendants, including Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited Imperial.
The case against the non-resident defendants, including UK-based Group companies, is stayed pending the outcome of their challenge to jurisdiction.
The Appeal Court hearing on this took place in February 2006 and judgement is awaited.

In addition, there are six class actions and four individual cases in Canada.
In the Knight Class Action, the Supreme Court of British Columbia certied a class of all consumers of Imperial manufactured cigarettes in British Columbia, not just British Columbia residents.
Imperial led their appeal against the certication on 23 June 2005.
This is a claim for pure economic loss.
The plaintiff does not seek damages for each class member but an aggregate damage award.
The appeal from the order certifying the action as a class proceeding was heard on 7 and 8 February 2006 and judgement is awaited.
In Quebec, in February 2005, two smoking and health class actions were certied.
There is no right of appeal against class certication.
This litigation is expected to take years to proceed to trial.
Imperial is currently being investigated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police relating to its business records and sales of products exported from Canada between 1989 and 1994.
No action has been commenced against Imperial.
Imperial believes that it has conducted itself appropriately at all times, but cannot predict the outcome of any such investigation, or whether additional investigations will occur.
The Flintkote Company Flintkote, a US company that was engaged in the production and distribution of asbestos and asbestos-containing material, was one of many subsidiaries of Genstar Corporation at the time that Imasco Limited now Imperial acquired Genstar Corporation in 1986.
Flintkote became a Group subsidiary following the restructuring of Imasco in 2000.
In 2003, the shares of Flintkote were divested to a trust.
Flintkote had been named, along with a large number of defendants, in numerous actions by individuals who seek damages based upon alleged exposure to asbestos products, or alleged damage to their buildings due to the presence in the buildings of certain materials containing asbestos, allegedly manufactured and or sold by such defendants.
Certain of these claims and suits allege significant damage.
Flintkote led for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in May 2004.
In December 2005, Flintkote led a status report in the bankruptcy proceedings alleging that Flintkotes estate has substantial claims against various parties that participated in certain transactions that allegedly left Flintkote with insufficient assets to satisfy foreseeable asbestos-related liabilities, including two dividends totalling US$525.2 million received ultimately by Imasco in 1986 and 1987, which dividends were paid by Flintkote from the proceeds generated through the sale of its operating assets.
As of 1984, Flintkote had ceased all production and distribution of asbestos-containing materials.
In connection with the 1986 and 1987 dividends, Imasco entered into certain contractual undertakings and indemnities with Flintkote and its directors.
Flintkote stated in the December 2005 status report that it intends to jointly prosecute, with the Ofcial Committee of Asbestos Personal Injury Claimants and the Legal Representative for Future Asbestos Personal Injury Claimants, various causes of action against Imasco and other former direct and indirect parent companies of Flintkote.
These include a cause of action to recover the US$525.2 million in dividends plus interest under the terms of the contractual undertakings and indemnities and, following further evaluation, possibly other causes of action against various parties that participated in dividend transactions and certain sale transactions that left Flintkote with insufficient assets to satisfy its asbestos-related liabilities.
Imperial believes that these claims are unfounded and that it has substantial defences to any such causes of action.
Conclusion While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse verdict, the Company believes that the defences of the Group companies to all these various claims are meritorious both on the law and the facts, and a vigorous defence is being made everywhere.
If an adverse judgement is entered against any of the Group companies in any case, an appeal will be made.
Such appeals could require the appellants to post appeal bonds or substitute security in amounts which could in some cases equal or exceed the amount of the judgement.
In any event, with regard to US litigation, the Group has the benefit of the RJRT indemnification.
At least in the aggregate and despite the quality of defences available to the Group, it is not impossible that the results of operations or cash ows of the Group in particular quarterly or annual periods could be materially affected by this and by the final outcome of any particular litigation.
Having regard to all these matters, the Directors i do not consider it appropriate to make any provision in respect of any pending litigation and ii do not believe that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will signicantly impair the financial condition of the Group.

Operating leases Total future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases comprise leases where payments fall due: 2005 2004 m m Property Within one year 49 56 Between one and five years 99 124 Beyond five years 231 227 Total 379 407 Plant and equipment Within one year 15 20 Between one and five years 12 15 Beyond five years 1 2 Total 28 37 31 Future changes to Group accounting policies Certain changes to IFRS which will be applicable in 2006 have been adopted by the European Union and will be applicable for the Group accounts.
To the extent that the Group has not adopted these early in the accounts to 31 December 2005, they will not affect the Group reported profit but they will affect disclosures.
The requirements that are considered to affect the Group relate to disclosures under IFRS7 Financial Instruments: disclosures and amendments to IAS1 Capital disclosures.
In addition, IFRIC4 on determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, may be relevant to certain contracts that the Group has with its suppliers.
However, it is considered that such contracts would only be operating leases, not finance leases, and would only affect how costs are presented and not the Groups profit.
In December 2005, the International Accounting Standards Board issued an amendment to IAS21 The effects of changes in foreign currency rates.
When this is adopted by the European Union, expected in 2006, it will allow intercompany balances that form part of a reporting entitys net investment in a foreign operation to be denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of either the ultimate parent or the foreign operation itself.
This will mean that certain exchange differences currently taken to the income statement would instead be reected directly in total equity.
The impact of the change would be to increase net finance costs in 2005 by 4 million 2004: 4 million decrease.
32 International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS The Group previously prepared its financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
From 1 January 2005, the Group is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and implemented in the UK.
As the 2005 financial statements include comparatives for 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRS under IFRS1 First time adoption of IFRS is 1 January 2004 and the 2004 comparatives are restated to IFRS.
IFRS1 permits those companies adopting IFRS for the first time certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition period.
The Group has taken the following key exemptions: 1 Business combinations prior to the date of transition are not restated.
2 All cumulative actuarial gains and losses for employee benets have been recognised at the date of transition.
3 As described in note 22 on page 73, IAS32 and IAS39 on financial instruments are being applied from 1 January 2005 and consequently the restated gures for 2004 do not reect the impact of these standards.
4 Cumulative exchange differences recognised separately in equity under IFRS are taken as nil at the date of transition.
qxd 14 3 06 1:02 pm Page 94 94 British American Tobacco Directors Report and Accounts 2005 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS continued 32 International Financial Reporting Standards continued IFRS does not contain the same specic presentation of exceptional items as UK GAAP but does require additional line items where necessary to an understanding of an entitys financial performance.
Given the material distortions to the profit from operations under IFRS, the Group continues to identify separately items similar to those previously treated as exceptional under UK GAAP.
Revenue included on page 97 is after deducting duty, excise and other taxes and excludes the share of associated company revenue.
The disposals line on page 97 comprises the gains on disposal of subsidiaries and non-current investments.
The main adjustments in changing to IFRS are as follows and the tables on page 97 are cross-referenced to the notes below where relevant: a Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for post-retirement benets under SSAP24, whereby the costs of providing pensions and post-retirement healthcare benets were charged against operating profit on a systematic basis with surpluses and deficits arising allocated over the expected average remaining service lives of current employees.
The approach under IFRS is described in the accounting policy on retirement benefit costs on page 31, and the impact on the income statement is similar to the FRS17 disclosure under UK GAAP, except that the unwinding of the discounting on liabilities and the expected return on assets are included in operating profit rather than net finance costs.
The adjustments to the UK GAAP balance sheet to reect the adoption of IAS19 at the date of transition are as follows: 31 December 1 January 2004 2004 m m Other investments 363 341 Retirement benefit assets 16 14 Deferred tax assets 41 174 Trade and other receivables 154 189 Retirement benefit liabilities 187 201 Deferred tax liabilities 22 33 Trade and other payables 15 18 Minority interests 1 1 Shareholders funds 237 493 The changes in the total adjustment and the components principally reect the removal of Brown & Williamson following the Reynolds American transaction.
b As described in the accounting policy on taxation on page 32, under IFRS it is necessary to provide deferred tax on the unremitted profit of associates and part of the unremitted profit of subsidiaries.
This is not required under UK GAAP.
As at 31 December 2004, this resulted in an additional deferred tax liability of 49 million 1 January 2004: 40 million and, for the year ended 31 December 2004, an additional charge of 7 million.
Under IFRS, it is also necessary to provide deferred tax on the difference between the carrying values and tax base of assets in operations which use ination accounting, as well as all differences between the carrying values and tax base for land and buildings.
As at 31 December 2004, these resulted in an additional deferred tax liability of 16 million 1 January 2004: 19 million.
c Under UK GAAP, the final dividend for the year was provided in the results for that year whereas under IFRS it is provided in the year that it is declared.
d Under UK GAAP, certain of the Groups share-based compensation plans did not result in a charge as they had no intrinsic value or were nanced by new shares.
However, other schemes nanced by the purchase of shares did have an intrinsic value and were charged to operating profit over the vesting period based on the share price at the date of grant.
Under IFRS, all share schemes result in a charge based on the fair value of the grant as described in the accounting policy on share-based payments on page 32.
qxd 14 3 06 1:02 pm Page 95 Directors Report and Accounts 2005 British American Tobacco 95 32 International Financial Reporting Standards continued Cash-settled share-based payments resulted in the recognition of an additional liability at 31 December 2004 of 8 million 1 January 2004: 6 million.
e Under UK GAAP, operating profit, net finance costs, taxation and minority interests included the Groups share of the associates results 144 million, 3 million, 8 million and 2 million respectively for 2004.
Under IFRS, the income statement only includes the Groups share of the post-tax and minority results of the associates as one line before the Groups pre-tax profit.
Previously under UK GAAP, interest on finance leases was included in operating profit, whereas under IFRS, it is included in net finance costs.
For the year ended 31 December 2004 this resulted in a reallocation of 4 million.
Under UK GAAP, the gains and losses on the disposal of subsidiaries and xed asset investments were shown as an exceptional item below operating profit 185 million in 2004.
Also the 918 million unrealised gain in respect of the Reynolds American transaction was included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under IFRS, both these gains are included in the profit from operations.
In addition, the gain on the disposals is different under IFRS as it is not necessary to write back the goodwill previously written off to reserves under UK GAAP, which results in an additional 216 million gain on disposal under IFRS.
f Under UK GAAP, goodwill on the balance sheet is amortised over its useful economic life.
From 1 January 2004, goodwill is not amortised under IFRS.
The gain on the disposal of Etinera is reduced by 20 million under IFRS as the goodwill allocated to this operation would not have been amortised.
Under IFRS, as negative goodwill arises it is recognised immediately in the income statement and therefore 6 million of negative goodwill under UK GAAP as at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 is credited to shareholders equity on transition to IFRS.
g Exchange differences on certain intercompany balances which do not meet the functional currency requirements under IAS21 are shown in the income statement not reserve movements and amounted to a pre-tax net loss of 1 million in net finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2004.
As these amounts are generated by exchange movements they will vary from period to period.
However, for most items, there are equal and offsetting amounts in reserve movements on consolidation and equity is unaffected.
In addition, 1 million of exchange losses have been reclassied from operating profit to net finance costs.
h 1 Under UK GAAP, companies operating in a hyper-inationary environment were permitted to adjust for ination by accounting in a hard currency, whereas under IFRS it is almost always required to use a system based on indexation.
For the year ended 31 December 2004, this resulted in increases in revenue of 4 million and operating profit of 7 million.
2 Under UK GAAP, where there are losses in subsidiaries with minority interests, the relevant share of the losses is allocated to minorities.
This is generally not permitted under IFRS and so minority interests are increased by 1 million at 31 December 2004 1 January 2004: 7 million and shareholders equity is reduced by the same amount.
The effect in the year ended 31 December 2004 is to increase minority interests and reduce retained profit by 6 million.
i Under UK GAAP, the book value of derivative financial instruments cross-currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts in respect of borrowings and short term deposits was included in their carrying value on the balance sheet.
Under IFRS, the book value of these derivatives is shown separately on the balance sheet and as at 31 December 2004 the adjustments are as follows: m Derivative financial instruments assets 146 Cash and cash equivalents 7 Increase in borrowings 89 Derivative financial instruments liabilities 64 BT2200 Report back.

The adjustments principally arise in respect of post-retirement benets, inventories, intangibles and property, plant and equipment.
With the separate recognition of intangibles under IFRS, there is a 49 million impairment charge net of tax following the implementation of a review of brand strategies resulting from the combination of R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson B&W.
The adjustment in respect of post-retirement benets, reected in the B&W liabilities as at the date of transition and consequently the net assets of Reynolds American Inc. results in a 128 million increase in the gain on disposal of B&W and a 12 million net of tax reduction in the restructuring costs in Reynolds American Inc.
The application of IFRS, including the non-amortisation of goodwill, decreases the Groups carrying value of associates as at 31 December 2004 by 84 million.
k Under UK GAAP, software assets were included as part of property, plant and equipment whereas under IFRS, unless they are integral to another xed asset, they are included as part of intangible assets.
As at 31 December 2004, these amounted to 92 million.
l Cash and cash equivalents under IFRS comprise cash and short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
The format of the cash ow statement changes under IFRS and the statement explains the change in cash and cash equivalents, rather than just cash as under UK GAAP.
m Under both UK GAAP and IFRS, basic earnings per share are based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period excluding shares held by the Groups two Employee Share Ownership Trusts.
The difference between the UK GAAP and IFRS gures is therefore largely the result of the different treatment of the profit on disposal of subsidiaries as described in e above and amortisation of goodwill as described in f above.
For both UK GAAP and IFRS, the adjusted diluted earnings per share uses a similar number of shares, with profit adjusted to exclude restructuring costs, investment costs written off, profit on disposal of subsidiaries and xed asset investments, goodwill amortisation impairment of brands and the exceptional credits arising from tax recoveries in Reynolds American Inc. in 2004. n Under IFRS, the Group continues to report regional business segments as for UK GAAP.
However, shared Group costs, which are corporate costs that are not directly attributable to individual segments under IFRS, are now shown as a separate line in the segmental analyses.
