Accounting estimates and judgements Critical accounting judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies Certain critical accounting judgements made in applying the Groups accounting policies are described below: Finance and operating leases The inception of the shop leases has taken place over a long period of time and many date back a significant number of years.
They are combined leases of land and buildings.
It is not possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the split of the fair values of the lease interest between land and buildings at inception.
Therefore, in determining lease classification the Group evaluated whether both parts are clearly an operating lease or a finance lease.
Firstly, land title does not pass.
Secondly, because the rent paid to the landlord for the buildings is increased to market rent at regular intervals, and the Group does not participate in the residual value of the building it is judged that substantially all the risks and rewards of the building are with the landlord.
Based on these qualitative factors it is concluded that the leases are operating leases.
Explanation of transition to IFRSs As stated in section b of the significant accounting policies, these are the Groups first consolidated accounts prepared in accordance with IFRSs.
The significant accounting policies set out on pages 32 to 36 have been applied in preparing the accounts for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2005, the comparative information presented in these accounts for the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2005 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 28 December 2003 the Groups date of transition.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in accounts prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRSs has affected the Groups financial position, financial performance and cashflows is set out in the following tables and notes.
