12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by reference to profit attributable to shareholders of 15.3m 2004, 17.9m divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the employee share ownership trusts.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares has been adjusted for the potential dilution of outstanding share options.
The average number of shares in issue used in all earnings per share calculations are as follows: Weighted average number 000s 2005 2004 Ordinary shares in issue 295,369 295,053 Shares owned by employee share ownership trusts 1,399 2,056 Basic earnings per share denominator 293,970 292,997 Issuable on conversion of options 694 1,115 Diluted earnings per share denominator 294,664 294,112 To assist comparison, an underlying earnings per share has also been calculated to exclude the impact of goodwill amortisation and operating exceptional items and is based on a profit for the financial year of 33.1m 2004, 35.3m.
13 Prior Period Adjustment The accounts for the 52 weeks to 28 February 2004 have been restated following the implementation of UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
The effect of this change is that shares held within Employee Share Option Schemes are no longer classified in the balance sheet as a fixed asset investment but as a deduction from shareholders funds.
The change has no impact on the profit and loss account.
