43 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The Group financial statements consolidate those of ITV plc and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates and jointly controlled entities.
As required by EU law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002 the Groups accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB, as adopted by the EU IFRS.
These are the Groups first consolidated financial statements to be prepared under IFRS and IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards has been applied.
The accounts are principally prepared on the historical cost basis.
Areas where other bases are applied are identied in the accounting policies below.
Details of accounting estimates and judgments made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements are discussed in note 36.
The comparative information presented in these accounts has been restated and represented under IFRS.
In respect of financial instruments, the Groups policy, as permitted under IFRS 1, has been to adopt IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 January 2005.
Comparatives have therefore not been restated to reect the requirements of IAS 32 and IAS 39 and continue to be presented in accordance with UK GAAP.
Note 37 sets out the impact of the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005.
Further details on the restatement of comparative information and conversion to IFRS are given later in these accounts on pages 70 and 71.
The parent companys individual accounts continue to be presented under UK GAAP.
The accounting policies set out below, except as noted above, have been applied consistently in presenting the consolidated financial information.
b Revenue recognition Revenue is stated exclusive of VAT and consists of sales of goods and services to third parties.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership and control of the goods sold and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Key classes of revenue are recognised on the following basis: Advertising and sponsorship on transmission Programme production on delivery Programme rights when contracted and available for exploitation Revenue on barter transactions is recognised only when the goods or services being exchanged are of a dissimilar nature.
c Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest under a contractual arrangement where the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures using the equity method.
An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint venture, over which the Group has significant inuence.
significant inuence is the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of an entity but is not control or joint control over those policies.
These investments are accounted for using the equity method.
d Current non-current distinction Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected to be realised in, or intended for sale or consumption in, the course of the Groups operating cycle.
All other assets are classied as non-current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course of the Groups operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date.
All other liabilities are classied as non-current liabilities.
e Property, plant and equipment Owned assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount less depreciation up to the date of transition.
Leases Finance leases are those which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Assets held under such leases are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and depreciation is provided as appropriate.
Outstanding finance lease obligations, which comprise the principal plus accrued interest, are included within borrowings.
The finance element of the agreements is charged to the income statement over the term of the lease on a systematic basis.
All other leases are operating leases the rentals on which are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less estimated residual value on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows: Vehicles, equipment and ttings 3 to 13 years Plant and machinery 10 to 20 years Properties: television studios 40 to 60 years leaseholds shorter of residual lease term or 70 years Freehold land not depreciated Freehold buildings up to 60 years 44 ITV plc 2005 annual report Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued f Intangible assets Business combinations and goodwill All business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 2004 are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identiable net assets acquired.
Subsequent adjustments to the fair values of net assets acquired made within 12 months of the acquisition date are accounted for from the date of acquisition.
For business combinations prior to this date, but after 30 September 1998, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP at that time less amortisation up to 31 December 2003.
The classication and accounting treatment of business combinations occurring prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has not been reconsidered as permitted under IFRS 1.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is allocated to cash generating units.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 30 September 1998 was recognised as a deduction from equity.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation except those identiable intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination which are shown at fair value at the date of acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3 Business combinations less accumulated amortisation.
Identiable intangible assets are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
The useful lives and amortisation methods for each major class of intangible asset are as follows: Film libraries Sum of digits 20 years Licences Straight line 11 to 17 years Brands Straight line up to 11 years Customer contracts Straight line up to 6 years Customer relationships Straight line 5 to 10 years g Distribution rights Programme rights acquired primarily for the purposes of distribution are classied within the balance sheet as non-current assets.
They are recognised initially at cost and charged through the income statement over either a three or five year period depending on genre.
h Equity investments Equity investments comprise equity securities which do not meet the denition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised directly in the available for sale reserve in equity.
Prior to the Groups adoption of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 January 2005, investments in equity securities were held at initial cost less any impairment subsequently recognised.
The effect of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 is shown in note 37. i Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiable cash ows cash-generating units.
Where an asset such as goodwill relates to more than one cash-generating unit, impairment is tested against the cash ows of the group of cash-generating units related to that asset.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
No reversal of impairment has been booked by the Group.
45 1 Accounting policies continued j Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction.
Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange ruling during the financial period.
Exchange differences arising on translation are recognised directly in the translation reserve in equity.
Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve within equity.
In respect of all foreign operations only those translation differences arising since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity as permitted under IFRS 1.
On disposal of an investment in a foreign operation the associated translation reserve balance is released to the income statement.
k Exceptional items Exceptional items, as disclosed on the face of the income statement, are items which due to their material and non-recurring nature have been classied separately in order to draw them to the attention of the reader of the accounts and to show more accurately the underlying profits of the Group.
l Programme rights Where programming, sports rights and lm rights are acquired for the primary purpose of broadcasting these are recognised within current assets.
An asset is recognised when the Group controls, in substance, the respective assets and the risks and rewards associated with them.
For acquired programme rights an asset is recognised as payments are made and is recognised in full when the acquired programming is available for transmission.
Programming produced internally either for the purpose of broadcasting or to be sold in the normal course of the Groups operating cycle is recognised within current assets at production cost.
Programme costs and rights are written off to operating costs in full on first transmission except certain lm rights which are written off over a number of transmissions.
Programme costs and rights not yet written off at the balance sheet date are included on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
m Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits with maturity of less than or equal to three months and cash held to meet finance lease commitments.
n Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation arising from past events and it is probable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows by a rate which reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the liability based on an appropriate gilt rate.
o Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, and in subsequent periods at amortised cost.
The difference between cost and redemption value being recorded in the income statement over the period of the liability on an effective interest basis.
Where the Group has identied that any such liabilities result in a mismatch between the accounting liability and the related derivative, the Group has adopted early the fair value option provision of IAS 39 revised.
The effect of this is that the Group recognises any such financial liabilities at fair value in all periods subsequent to initial recognition, with resultant gains or losses recorded in the income statement.
p Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations IFRS 5 Non-current assets or disposal groups are classied as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than continuing use, they are available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable.
On initial classication as held for sale, non-current assets or disposal groups are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
No amortisation or depreciation is charged on non-current assets including those in disposal groups classied as held for sale.
Assets classied as held for sale are disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet and classied as current assets or liabilities with disposal groups being separated between assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale.
IFRS 5 applies prospectively for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and has therefore not been adopted for the comparative period.
46 ITV plc 2005 annual report Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued q Taxation The tax charge for the period comprises both current and deferred tax.
Taxation is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise the temporary difference.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed net to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same authority and the Group has the right of set off.
r Employee benets Dened contribution schemes Obligations under the Groups dened contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Dened benefit schemes The Groups obligation in respect of dened benefit pension schemes is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of scheme assets is deducted.
The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high quality corporate bonds.
The calculation is performed by a qualied actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The Group has taken the option of adopting early the amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benets issued on 16 December 2004.
As a result, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they arise through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Share based compensation The Group operates a number of share based compensation schemes.
The fair value of the equity instrument is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period through the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using either a Monte Carlo or Black-Scholes model as appropriate taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reect the actual vesting except where forfeiture is due only to market based criteria not being achieved.
s ITV shares held by Employee benefit Trusts EBTs Transactions of the Group-sponsored EBTs are included in the Groups financial statements.
In particular, the EBTs purchases of shares in ITV plc are debited directly to equity.
t Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to uctuations in interest and other foreign exchange rates.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with the movement recorded in the income statement.
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined by using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Prior to the Groups adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005 interest receipts and payments under interest rate swap and option agreements were accrued so as to match the net income or cost with the related finance expense.
No amounts were recognised in respect of future periods.
The difference between the fair value and book value of bonds and derivative instruments arising on the acquisition accounting for Carlton was amortised through net interest over the remaining life of the instruments.
The effect of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 is shown in note 37. u Dividends Dividends are recognised through equity in the period in which they are declared.
v Investment income Investment income comprises dividends received from the Group's investments.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the Group's right to receive payments is established.
w Net nancing costs Net nancing costs principally comprise interest payable, finance charges on finance leases, interest receivable on funds invested, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement and the expected return on pension scheme assets net of the interest cost on liabilities.
47 2 Segmental reporting The Groups primary segmental reporting is by business segment with secondary segmental reporting being by geographical segment.
Primary segmental reporting The Group has one main producer broadcaster reportable business segment.
This segment includes all activities related to the production and broadcasting of television programmes and channels, including the exploitation of related rights and assets.
Any activities falling outside this main segment are grouped together as other operations.

The largest element of this 25 million was staff related.
Also included in 2005 is an 11 million receipt from the liquidators of ONdigital.
A 10 million loss has been recognised in relation to the education business after its classication as a disposal group held for sale.
Reorganisation and integration costs in 2004 of 65 million were principally costs associated with the integration of the Carlton, Granada and new subsidiary businesses into ITV plc.
The largest element of these costs 41 million were staff related with further costs incurred arising as a result of integrating our IT systems and infrastructure, property portfolio and xed asset base.
6 Pension schemes The Group operates a number of dened benefit and dened contribution pension schemes.
Dened contribution schemes Total contributions recognised as an expense in relation to dened contribution schemes during 2005 were 2 million 2004: 2 million.
Dened benefit schemes The Group operates a number of final salary dened benefit schemes.
The majority of these schemes are funded and associated scheme assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The movement in the present value of the dened benefit obligation for these schemes is analysed below: 2005 2004 m m Dened benefit obligation at 1 January 2,357 1,552 Business combinations 570 Current service cost 26 28 Curtailment gain 2 4 Interest cost 125 113 Net actuarial loss 184 179 Contributions by scheme participants 5 6 Benets paid 91 87 Dened benefit obligation at 31 December 2,604 2,357 The present value of the dened benefit obligation is analysed between wholly unfunded and funded dened benefit schemes in the table below: 2005 2004 m m Dened benefit obligation in respect of funded schemes 2,573 2,330 Dened benefit obligation in respect of wholly unfunded schemes 31 27 Total dened benefit obligation 2,604 2,357 The movement in the fair value of the dened benefit scheme assets is analysed below: 2005 2004 m m Fair value of assets at 1 January 1,685 1,130 Business combinations 432 Expected return on assets 112 107 Net actuarial gain 219 56 Employer contributions 142 41 Contributions by scheme participants 5 6 Benets paid 91 87 Fair value of assets at 31 December 2,072 1,685 The assets and liabilities of the scheme are recognised in the balance sheet and shown within non-current liabilities.

Included within actuarial gains and losses are experience adjustments as follows: 2005 2004 m m Experience adjustments on scheme assets 219 56 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities 9 70 The scheme assets are shown below by major category along with the associated expected rates of return.
Expected long Expected long term rate Market term rate Market of return value of return value 2005 2005 2004 2004 %m %m Market value of assets equities and property 7.5 1,421 7.5 1,198 Market value of assets bonds 4.1 5.6 618 4.5 6.1 453 Market value of assets other 4.5 4.9 33 4.75 5.4 34 Total scheme assets 2,072 1,685 The expected long term rate of return on assets assumption is assessed by considering the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The actual return on plan assets in the year ended 31 December 2005 was 331 million 2004: 163 million.
The principal assumptions used in the scheme valuations at the balance sheet date were: 2005 2004 Rate of general increase in salaries 4.00% 4.25% Rate of increase in pension payment 2.75% 2.75% Rate of increase to deferred pensions 2.75% 2.75% Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.90% 5.40% Ination assumption 2.75% 2.75% For mortality rates the Group has used PA92 tables with mortality projected to 2015 for pensioner members and to 2030 for non-pensioner members.
Using these tables a male member currently aged 40 is expected to live for a further 45 years, while a male pensioner aged 60 is expected to live a further 24 years.
The Group reected this recognition that mortality rates have reduced in its 2004 valuation.
The tables above have been used for both 2005 and 2004 and reect published mortality investigation data in conjunction with the results of investigations into the mortality experience of scheme members.
Normal contributions into the schemes in 2006 are expected to be in the region of 20 million based on contribution rates agreed with scheme trustees.
Payments totalling 207 million have been made in early 2006 as part of the announced 325 million lump sum payment to address the schemes deficit being the balance following the 118 million payment in December 2005.

The Granada Media and Granada Commitment schemes mirror the ITV scheme summarised in the remuneration report on page 82.
The main differences are as follows: 25% of the Matching Awards will vest for median ranking, and maximum vesting will occur only for first or second position out of a comparator group of sixteen companies set out in the remuneration report on page 87.
The performance condition is tested in respect of 50% of the Matching Award on the second anniversary of the date of grant.
Any portion of the Matching Award which does not vest at that time may vest when the condition is again tested on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant.
Performance conditions were adjusted to take account of the merger.
The Granada Media, Granada, Carlton and ITV Sharesave schemes are Inland Revenue Approved SAYE schemes.
The Granada Media, Granada and Carlton Executive Option schemes are Inland Revenue Approved and Unapproved schemes with three year performance periods.
For all options granted before December 2002 the performance conditions were deemed to be satisfied on the merger of Carlton and Granada.
The performance conditions for options granted from December 2002 measure TSR against a comparator group of companies permitting exercise only if ITV is ranked above the median of this group.
The comparator group for Granada is set out in the remuneration report on page 87.
The comparator group for Carlton is the FTSE 100 at date of grant.
The Carlton Equity Participation Plan operated under similar terms to the ITV Commitment Scheme summarised in the remuneration report on page 82.
For all awards made before December 2002 the performance conditions were deemed to be satisfied on the merger of Carlton and Granada.
For awards made from December 2002, 33% of the Matching Award vests at median with maximum vesting occurring when ITV ranks in the upper quartile against a comparator group of UK media companies.
The performance condition is tested on 1 April following the third anniversary of the date of grant.
Any proportion that does not vest at this time may vest when the condition is tested on 1 April following the fourth anniversary of the date of grant.
The Granada Deferred Share Award Plan mirrors the ITV scheme summarised in the remuneration report on page 82.
The Carlton Deferred Annual Bonus Plan operated as a share award scheme.
Shares were purchased from bonus entitlements and held in trust for a three year period.
Matching shares were awarded and released after four years.
Exercises can be satisfied by market purchase or by new issue shares.
No new shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of the Deferred Share Award Plan or nil-cost options under the Commitment Scheme.
However it is now Company practice to satisfy all option exercises where possible by using shares purchased in the market and held in the Granada, Carlton and ITV Employees benefit Trusts rather than by issuing new shares.
ITV plc was formed on the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications Plc on 2 February 2004.
The Executive Option Schemes, Commitment Schemes and Performance Share Plans all have market based performance conditions which are taken into account in the fair value calculation using a Monte Carlo pricing model.
The Black-Scholes model is used to value the Sharesave Schemes as these do not have any market performance conditions.
Share-based payment charges totalled 21 million in 2005 2004: 15 million.
Of these 4 million have been shown within exceptional items 2004: nil.

The underlying tax rate on operating profits, after adjusting for exceptional items, overprovisions in prior years, and excluding associates and joint ventures is 28% 2004: 27%.
A tax expense totalling 8 million 2004: credit of 37 million has been recognised directly in equity representing a current tax credit of 2 million 2004: nil and a deferred tax expense of 10 million 2004: credit of 37 million.

Potential deferred tax assets estimated at 0.7 billion, primarily in respect of capital losses and loan relationship deficits, have not been recognised due to uncertainties as to amount and whether gain or income will arise in the appropriate form and relevant territory against which such losses could be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are also not recognised because the Group controls whether the liability will be incurred and is satisfied that it will not be incurred in the foreseeable future.

In 2004 an impairment of 5 million was recognised within exceptional items as a result of an impairment review on elements of goodwill attached to the education business.
Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following units have significant carrying amounts of goodwill: 2005 2004 m m Broadcasting 2,963 2,889 Multiple units without significant goodwill 462 402 3,425 3,291 The recoverable amount of the Broadcasting cash-generating units is based on value in use calculations.
Those calculations use cash ow projections based on actual operating results and the five year business plan.
Cash ows in perpetuity are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate and are appropriate because broadcasting is a long term business.
The growth rate used is consistent with the long term average growth rate for the industry.
A pre-tax discount rate of 11.4% has been used in discounting the projected cash ows.

25 Financial instruments Financial instruments disclosures 2005 a Treasury operation and policy The most significant treasury exposures faced by the Group are raising finance, managing interest rate and currency positions and investing surplus cash in high quality assets.
Treasury policies have been approved by the Board for managing each of these exposures including levels of authority on the type and use of financial instruments.
Transactions are only undertaken if they relate to underlying exposures.
The treasury department reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board and treasury operations are subject to periodic independent reviews and internal audit.
Financing The Groups nancing policy for long term funding is to use debt instruments with a range of maturities.
It is substantially funded from the UK and European capital markets and has bank facilities from the UK syndicated market.
Interest rate management The Groups interest rate policy is to be between 30% and 70% xed on its forecast net indebtedness over the medium term in order to provide a balance between certainty of cost and benefit from low oating rates.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and options in order to achieve the desired mix between xed and oating.
Currency management The Groups foreign exchange policy is to hedge foreign currency denominated costs at the time of commitment and to hedge a proportion of foreign currency denominated revenues on a rolling 12 month basis.
It is also the Groups policy to hedge major balance sheet exposures.
The policies signicantly reduce the Groups earnings and balance sheet exposures to changes in exchange rates.
62 ITV plc 2005 annual report Notes to the accounts 25 Financial instruments continued Investment in cash The Group operates strict investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash and the emphasis is on preservation of capital.
Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long term ratings published by the major credit rating agencies.
Deposits longer than three months require the approval of the Management Committee of the Board.
b Measurement Equity investments Equity investments are detailed in note 15.
The fair value is based on year end quoted prices for listed investments and estimates of likely sales proceeds for other investments.
Cash equivalents The carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the instruments.
Loans The 200 million and 250 million Eurobonds have book and fair values of 207 million and 253 million respectively based upon their bid price valuations at 31 December 2005.
The bonds are being carried at fair value with the resultant gains or losses recorded in the income statement in accordance with our accounting policy which prevent an accounting mismatch with the related swaps.
The d356 million Exchangeable bond is accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
At 31 December 2005 its book value was 245 million and its fair value based upon bid price was 243 million.
The Yen 2 billion loan note is accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
At 31 December 2005 its book value was 11 million and its fair value based upon bid price was 10 million.
The 325 million Eurobond is accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
It had a book value of 321 million and a fair value based upon bid price of 327 million at 31 December 2005.
The fair value of all other loans and finance leases were the same as book value at 31 December 2005.
Interest rate swaps and options All interest rate swaps and options are accounted for at their fair value based upon termination prices.
The fair value of these instruments at 31 December 2005 was 19 million.
Other current assets and liabilities No disclosure of fair value has been made as the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The cash and short term deposits, where interest bearing, attract interest at oating rates based on LIBID for periods of up to one month.
The non-interest bearing financial assets principally comprise investments and the Group has made no decision to dispose of them.

The liabilities have a weighted average interest rate of 7.6% after taking account of interest rate swaps and have a weighted average term of six years.
Interest rate swaps matched against the 200 million Eurobond are described below: In April 2003 the 200 million Eurobond was swapped such that the Group receives the bond coupon of 7.625% and pays six month sterling LIBOR plus 3.19%.
The bank has the option to cancel the swap for nil value at each six monthly rate xing date.
In May 2004 the Group entered into a one year swap for 75 million, a two year swap for 75 million and a three year swap for 50 million under which it receives six month sterling LIBOR plus 3.19% and pays xed rates of 8.41%, 8.65% and 8.68% respectively.
The Group also has a further swap matched against this Eurobond which was dormant as at 31 December 2004.
Under the terms of this dormant swap if six month dollar LIBOR exceeds 3.75% the Group receives the bond coupon of 7.625% and pays the higher of six month dollar LIBOR plus 0.75% set in arrears or in advance payable in sterling or 6 month sterling LIBOR minus 0.1% set in arrears or in advance.
If six month dollar LIBOR set in advance sets above 6.5% a further 1% margin for that period is payable.
This swap is not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes and as such the Groups policy is to provide to the extent that the swap represents an onerous contract.
As at 31 December 2004 there was no provision against this swap.
Sterling oating rate liabilities Sterling oating rate cost of borrowing mainly comprises the post swap costs of various debt instruments described below: The a639 million Exchangeable bond was swapped with effect from May 2002 from its xed rate cost of 2.25% into a oating rate cost of one month sterling LIBOR minus 2.81% on a notional amount of 395 million until January 2005.
In September 2004 the Group repurchased a158 million of the Exchangeable.
In December 2004 a125 million of the bonds were put for settlement in January 2005.
At this time the Group entered into a forward starting 2 year swap commencing January 2005 whereby it receives 2.25% annually matched to the remaining a356 million bonds and pays 3 month sterling LIBOR minus 0.23% on a notional 252 million.
The 250 million Eurobond was swapped in July 2003 with subsequent amendments in May 2004 and December 2004 from its xed rate coupon of 5.625% into the higher of six month sterling LIBOR set in arrears plus 1.045% or the payment rate used in the previous 6 month period.

As part of the acquisition, loan amounts due by these companies, totalling 53 million, were repaid bringing the total cash outow of the Group to 136 million.
SDN holds the licence to operate Multiplex A on digital terrestrial television.
In the period to 31 December 2005 SDN contributed 8 million to the consolidated operating profit of the Group before additional amortisation of 4 million.

A deferred tax liability of 25 million has been recognised in respect of these intangible assets.

The strategic benets are principally the enhanced ability to promote Freeview as a platform, business relationships with the channels which are on Multiplex A and the additional capacity available from 2010.
These, in combination with existing Group assets including the ITV brand and programming, generate the goodwill on acquisition.
Friends Reunited On 6 December 2005, the Group agreed to acquire 100% of the shares in Friends Reunited Holdings Limited for a total initial consideration of 120 million and deferred consideration of up to 55 million payable in 2009 contingent upon the future performance of the acquired business.

The fair value of the consideration is 145 million.
