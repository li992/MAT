Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group manages a number of defined contribution pension arrangements.
The total expense recognised in the income statement of 7.6m 2004: 5.7m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
There were no significant contributions outstanding at the end of 2004 or 2005 for either the defined benefit or defined contribution schemes.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan CPP, which is a funded defined benefit scheme.
The assets of all of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
From 1 January 2003, new employees in the UK have only been able to join the defined contribution scheme.
In the USA, the Carleton Technologies defined benefit scheme has been closed to new members from 13 December 2003.
In 2005, as a part of the settlement of the disposal of the Fluid and Air group, a special contribution of 24m was made to the main Cobham defined benefit scheme and a curtailment benefit of 5m and a settlement gain of 1m were recognised as part of the profit on disposal Note 32.
The most recent actuarial valuations of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP were carried out at 1 April 2004 and updated to 31 December 2005 by qualified independent actuaries.
Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable country regulations.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: UK Schemes USA Schemes European Schemes At 31 December 2005 Rate of increase in salary costs 3.50% 3.50% 1.00% Discount rate 5.00% 5.50% 4.50% Inflation assumption 2.90% 3.00% N A Expected return on scheme assets 7.07% 7.25% N A Pensions increase 2.9% N A 1.75% unless overridden by specific scheme rules The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit scheme is as follows: m 2005 2004 Present value of funded obligations 451.3 363.3 Fair value of scheme assets 370.3 294.2 Net liability 81.0 69.1 The net liability above includes 1.7m 2004: 1.5m in relation to one of the European schemes which is unfunded.
The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by the Group.

Share-based payments Equity-settled share option scheme The Group operates two incentive schemes for certain senior executives, the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
Under the LTIP scheme awards are made at nil cost, vesting over a three year performance period based on the Groups Total Shareholder Return relative to that of a comparator group and also conditional upon the Groups EPS growth over the same period.
Under the ESOS, options are granted at a price not less than the market value of the Groups ordinary shares on, or shortly before the date the options are granted.
Exercise is conditional upon the Groups EPS growth over a three year period.
Further details of these schemes can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In addition, entry to the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme ShareSave, is available to all employees of participating subsidiaries.
Employees may purchase the Groups shares at 80% of the closing market price on the date of grant during a two-week period each year, up to a maximum contribution value of 3,000 in any one year.
The shares so purchased are generally placed in the employees share savings plan and will only be released to employees who remain in the Groups employment for a period of three years from the date of grant.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows: 2005 2004 Number of Number of LTIP share options share options Outstanding at the beginning of the year 3,383,730 2,481,630 Granted during the year 1,526,990 1,655,370 Forfeited during the year 430,410 Exercised during the year 93,014 Expired during the year 519,760 753,270 Outstanding at the end of the year 3,867,536 3,383,730 Exercisable at the end of the year The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.53 years 2004: 1.75 years.
During 2005, options were granted on 11 May with an estimated fair value of 0.551.
In 2004, options were granted on 28 April and 20 September.
The estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates were 0.883 and 0.815 respectively.
These fair values were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model modified by a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the likely impact of market-related performance conditions.
The inputs into the model were as follows: 2005 2004 Weighted average share price 1.335 1.359 Weighted average exercise price Nil N A Expected volatility 22% 25% Expected life 3 Years 3 Years Risk free rate 4.4% 4.8% Expected dividend yield 2.3% 2.1% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Values ascribed to technology and software represent the fair value of acquired trade secrets and processes, patented and unpatented technology and knowhow held by the acquired company at time of entry into the Group.
This category also includes the purchase of technology and software rights and licenses, where it is appropriate to recognise such items as assets.
Values ascribed to development costs represent the directly attributable costs of internally generated development knowledge from the point at which an individual project meets the requirements for capitalisation until it is available for utilisation in the business.
Values ascribed to other Intangible Fixed Assets represent both purchased and acquired patents, licences and trademarks.
All of these assets are recognised at fair value to purchase or acquire and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Fair values of acquired Intangible Fixed Assets have been assessed by reference to the future estimated cash flows arising from the application of assets, discounted at an appropriate rate to present value, or by reference to the amount that would have been paid in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.

Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill arising on acquisitions during 2005 has been allocated as follows: m 2005 Aerospace Systems H. Koch & Sons Co 21.1 Chelton REMEC Defense and Space Inc 54.8 Other acquisitions 10.0 Flight Operations & Services At 31 December 2005 85.9 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period for which management have detailed plans.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured.
The growth rates are based on the GDP of the primary market for the CGU, adjusted to recognise an estimate of the historic and projected premium associated with the high technological content associated with the business.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows after that period based on growth rates as described above.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10.5% 2004: 10.5%.
Following detailed review, no impairment losses have been recognised in the period and no prior impairment losses reversed.
REMEC Defense & Space Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, has 54.8m of goodwill allocated to it and no other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
The recoverable amount associated with this goodwill has been determined on a value in use basis.
Key assumptions are as follows: The authorised plan for the company has been extrapolated in perpetuity using a growth rate of 6.0% and discounted to a present value using the Group assumption of 10.5%.
Growth rate is based on US GDP adjusted to reflect a premium for the nature of the CGUs business.
Sensitivity analysis has determined that the discount rate of 10.5% is the most influential assumption on the outcome of the recoverable amount calculation.
The recoverable amount exceeds the total carrying value of assets for this CGU by 52m and the discount rate would need to increase to more than 12.5% in order for the carrying value to be impaired.
European Antennas Ltd is the CGU most sensitive to an increase in discount rate.
Currently the goodwill in this CGU is not impaired, based on a discount rate of 10.5% and a long-term growth rate of 2.8%.
If the discount rate were to rise to 11.0%, a goodwill impairment of 0.5m would be required for this CGU.
The remainder of the goodwill is allocated to various CGUs across the Group, no individual amounts other than those disclosed above are considered individually significant.

Investment properties m 2005 2004 Investment property at cost 4.1 4.1 Accumulated depreciation 0.1 Carrying amount 4.0 4.1 All of the Groups investment property is held under freehold interests and is valued under the cost model.
Property rental income earned by the Group from its investment property amounted to 0.5m 2004: 0.5m, which is net of all direct costs associated with the leasing of the property, save for depreciation.
The annual depreciation charge is 84,000, calculated on a straight-line method over 50 years, in line with the Groups policy for freehold buildings.
The building is leased to a commercial user on an operating lease with a 25 year term that commenced in 1998.
A fair value of 7.0m has been ascribed to the property, this is based on an estimated market price provided by the agent who manages the property on the Groups behalf.
The agent is experienced in marketing such properties in the location.
No formal valuation has been completed.

During the year the Group acquired the remaining 60% of this companys shares as detailed in Note 30, consequently this entity is fully consolidated as at 31 December 2005.
Joint ventures The Group has the following significant interests in joint ventures within the Flight Operations and Services division: a 45% of the voting share capital in Aviation Dfense Service S. A. a company incorporated in France.
b 50% of the voting share capital in FB Heliservices Limited, a company incorporated in England.
c 50% of the voting share capital in FBS Limited, a company incorporated in England.
Governance structures for Aviation Dfense Service S. A are such that the Group has joint control with its partner and therefore the investment is treated as a joint venture.
The share of the balance sheets and income statements of the joint ventures which has been included in the consolidated financial statements is as follows: m 2005 2004 Current assets 18.1 23.0 Non-current assets 46.3 46.7 64.4 69.7 Current liabilities 5.7 13.1 Non-current liabilities 44.0 43.4 49.7 56.5 Net assets 14.7 13.2 Income 32.7 31.1 Expenses 28.5 26.7 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 59 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 17.

This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents include the following for the purposes of the cash flow statement: m Note 2005 2004 Cash and cash equivalents 251.8 176.0 Bank overdrafts 13.5 74.6 238.3 101.4 Cash and cash equivalents held in discontinued businesses 33 8.3 246.6 101.4 20.

The net movement in provisions excluding reclassifications and subsidiary acquisitions disposals was a net reduction of 0.6m.
Contingent consideration Contingent consideration has been provided for where it is considered probable that the conditions applicable to the payment of contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions made by the Group in current and previous years will be met.
The amount provided is therefore the amount considered likely to be payable in the event of these conditions being met.
Arrangements of this nature vary, but may typically extend for up to five years.
Warranty claims The warranty provision represents managements best estimate of the Groups liability under warranties granted on products sold, based on past experience and industry averages for defective products.
It is anticipated that most of these costs will be incurred in the next two financial years.
Contract loss provisions Contract loss provisions represent managements best estimate of the amount by which the expected benefits from certain specific contracts are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under those contracts.
The timeframe within which such provisions will unwind varies by contract, but is generally in excess of one year.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Aircraft maintenance provisions are established in respect of significant periodic maintenance costs, where maintenance activity is required on operational aircraft or engines on a cycle greater than 12 months.
Costs are charged to the income statement on the basis of utilisation of the aircraft and are credited to the provision.
The provision is then utilised by absorbing the actual costs incurred in carrying out the maintenance activity.
Maintenance carried out on a cycle of 12 months or less is charged to the income statement as incurred.
When aircraft are leased, it is customary for the contract to contain specific conditions regarding the state of the aircraft on its return to the lessor at the end of the lease.
These conditions may relate to the number of operational hours to be available before a major maintenance check, the physical configuration of the aircraft or direct costs to be incurred by the lessee in the physical return of the aircraft to the lessor.
The estimated cost associated with fulfilling these requirements is charged to the income statement on an aircraft utilisation basis.
The provision is utilised on actual return of the aircraft or on incurring the expenditure required to return the aircraft to the state of maintenance required by the lease before return of the aircraft to the lessor.
Other provisions Other provisions include provisions recognised in connection with the disposal of the Fluid and Air group and specific legal claims outstanding at the year end where a liability is seen as probable.
Of these amounts 8m relates to liabilities deriving from tax related matters that were previously provided within corporation tax.
This amount is included within reclassification.
All amounts have been determined based on the directors current estimates of likely outcomes.
Provisions relating to the Fluid and Air disposal are likely to unwind over a period of more than one year.
All other items are likely to be resolved over a period of one to two years.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams.
These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax continued At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 196m 2004: 163m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Groups share of the tax on temporary differences arising in connection with interests in joint ventures was 1.8m 2004: 1.9m.

All other borrowings were at floating rates with regular repricing dates exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
In respect of the fixed rate borrowings the group held senior notes as at 31 December 2005 of 128.6m 2004: 118.4m which were swapped into floating rates on issuance in 2002 through to their maturity in 2009 31.3m and 2012 97.3m, the rates being set on a six monthly basis.
The Group has applied hedge accounting in respect of the swap and its fair value is detailed in Note 25.
Of the floating rate debt of 276.4m at the year end the Group held a forward starting swap that will have the effect of swapping 151.4m of current bank loans at floating rate into fixed rate at 4.48% from January 2006 through to maturity in June 2010, with quarterly reset dates.
The Group has applied hedge accounting in respect of the swap and its fair value is detailed in Notes 25 and 27c.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 63 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 23.
Borrowings continued The Group has the following undrawn borrowing facilities in various currencies available in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
These facilities are at floating interest rates: m 2005 2004 Expiring within one year 65.6 47.8 Expiring between one and five years 59.0 71.6 124.6 119.4 The estimated fair value of the Groups borrowings, by discounting their future cash flows at the market rate, is as follows: m 2005 2004 Bank overdrafts 13.5 74.6 Bank loans 266.2 112.0 Loan notes 10.2 11.9 Senior notes held at fair value 137.3 130.3 Other borrowings 1.3 11.1 428.5 339.9 Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The Group has principal bank loans as follows: In July 2005, a new 300m revolving multi-currency credit facility was entered into to replace an existing 150m facility and the US$200m bridge facility put in place to finance the REMEC acquisition.
This facility, arranged for general corporate purposes, is for five years, with extensions of up to two years at the option of the banks.
Interest is payable at the drawn currencies applicable LIBOR rate plus margin.
The loan agreement contains no provisions for charges over Group assets and includes both financial and non financial covenants.
As at 31 December 2005, 241.6m had been drawn on this facility.
A seven year bank loan for AUS$25.9m 11.0m, 2004: 10.6m expiring in June 2007 is secured by an all assets and undertakings charge over the Groups Australian operations.
These operations had gross assets of AUS$181.6m 77.6m, 2004: 82.3m which includes cash and cash equivalents of AUS$23.0m 9.8m, 2004: 12.4m.
In addition, two tranches of senior notes were issued in 2002, being US$55m maturing in 2009 with a 5.14% coupon and US$170m maturing in 2012 with a 5.58% coupon.

The average lease term remaining is seven years.
For the year ended 31 December 2005, the average effective borrowing rate was 9.0% 2004: 9.2%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date, and thus expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
Lease obligations are denominated in sterling, US dollars and euros.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors title to the underlying leased assets.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The Groups multi-national operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, equity securities prices, liquidity and interest rates.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt, and other instruments, including interest rates swaps.
Financial instruments The Group finances its operations primarily through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.
Where it does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The Group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to manage transactional currency risks arising from the Groups operations and interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risks.
Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Groups overseas net assets.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The policies have remained unchanged throughout the year.
Foreign currency risk The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further investments in other EU countries, Australia, Canada, South Africa and Asia.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk.
Where significant, currency denominated net assets are partially hedged by currency borrowings and as at the year end 330.6m US dollar borrowings and 52.9m of euro borrowings were designated as the hedging instrument in net investment hedges.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from sales and purchases by operating units in currencies other than the units functional currency.
The Groups policy is to minimise trading in subsidiaries non operating currencies.
However, where this is impractical the Group will seek to reduce its exposure through the use of forward contracts.
Currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by the parent company.
The sterling US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as Cobham is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which the subsidiaries expect to receive from their normal business activities.
In addition to the longer term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts.
As at 31 December 2005, $224m 2004: $221m of dollar forward contracts were in place with maturity dates out to 2014 2004: 2014.
These contracts are at an average exchange rate of $1.72: 1 2004: $1.68: 1.
It is the Groups current belief that the net dollar receipts from its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitment.
Interest rate risk The Group has various long and short term borrowings principally in US dollars, euros and sterling at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
The Group is monitoring continually its exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs.
Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions.
Operating under this interest rate management policy the Group has acquired interest swaps, further detail in respect of these instruments and their accounting treatment is detailed in Notes 23 and 24.
Surplus funds are placed on short term deposit.
These deposits have floating rates of interest, and thus there is some modest exposure to interest rates.
Liquidity risk The Group has a strong cash flow and where practicable the funds generated by operating companies are managed on a regional basis.
For short-term working capital purposes in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall Group arrangement.
In the USA a central treasury function is maintained which all US subsidiaries use.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the Groups policy throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings with their lenders.
Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities and the use of the Groups revolving credit facility.
In addition, it is the Groups policy to maintain undrawn committed borrowing facilities in order to provide flexibility in the management of the Groups liquidity: details are provided in Note 23.
Commodity price risk The Groups exposure to price risk is minimal.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 65 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 25.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Due to this, the directors believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for doubtful receivables.
In the UK the group has a master netting arrangement in respect of bank balances.
In the normal course of business these bank accounts are not settled on a net basis and as such are presented in the financial statements as gross.
In the event of an automatic enforcement event the bank balances are automatically set off against each other to achieve a net position.
The Group has not pledged any assets in respect of any of its primary borrowing facilities, except as disclosed in Notes 23 and 24.
Comparative balances have not been restated in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 1 and are therefore stated under SSAP 20 Foreign Currency Translation of UK GAAP.

On 8 July 2005 the ordinary shares of Cobham plc were subdivided such that each existing ordinary share was replaced by ten new ordinary shares.
The new subdivision of share capital has been made to improve liquidity in the trading of Cobham plc shares.
The numbers of shares above have been restated to reflect this change.
The 6% second cumulative preference shares are non-redeemable and are classified as borrowings.
The shareholders of the 6% second cumulative preference shares are entitled to receive a fixed cumulative preference dividend at the rate of 6% per annum in priority to the payment of dividends on the ordinary shares included within finance income as shown in Note 3.
In addition, on a return of assets on the liquidation or otherwise of the company, the assets available for distribution are to be applied first in repaying to the holders of the 6% second cumulative preference shares the amounts paid up on their shares.
On a show of hands, every member holding 6% second cumulative preference shares who is present in person has one vote and on a poll, every member has one vote for every 1 in nominal amount of the shares of which the member is the holder.

Adjustment of prior year fundamental accounting error on transition to IFRS During the Groups IFRS conversion project, errors were identified in the accounts of National Jet Systems Pty Ltd that dated back to accounting entries on acquisition in 2000.
The errors related to provisions required for heavy maintenance costs and obligations relating to the return of aircraft and engines under operating lease contracts.
In accordance with IFRS 1, these fundamental prior year errors have been adjusted on transition with the effect that provisions as at 1 January 2004 have been increased by 9.7m, a tax asset of 2.9m has been recognised and opening reserves adjusted by a net 6.8m.
In addition, some small adjustments have been made to the unaudited IFRS transition statements previously published to reflect reclassification more accurately and the amended reconciliations are included in Note 40.

Annual Report & Accounts 2005 69 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 30.
Acquisition of subsidiaries continued All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess of total cost over the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Goodwill represents the value of synergies and assembled workforces acquired.
Adjustments from book value to fair value include adjustments arising from the application of Group accounting policies, the recognition of Intangible Fixed Assets under IFRS 3 Business Combinations and fair value adjustments to inventories, receivables, property plant and equipment, payables and contract loss provisions.
If the acquisitions during the year had taken effect on 1 January 2005 the consolidated entity would have recorded total revenues of 1,138m and net profit after tax of 106m.
These results have been adjusted to fully amortise intangibles acquired other than goodwill together with related income tax effects.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the operations been acquired at the start of the year, nor of future results of the combined operations.

Discontinued operations During the year, the Board decided to dispose of various business operations, in line with the Group strategy to focus on key markets and value-added technologies.
On 28 June 2005 the Board decided to dispose of the Groups Countermeasures operations and the process has now been completed.
FR Countermeasures Inc was sold on 23 December 2005, accordingly this has been treated as a disposal in these financial statements.
On 8 March 2006 a definitive agreement was signed to sell Wallop Defence Systems Ltd and this is classified as held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet.
The operations are included in the Aerospace Systems division in the Groups segmental analysis Note 1.
The proceeds of disposal of the remaining operations exceeded the book value of the related net assets and accordingly no impairment losses have been recognised on the classification of these operations as held for sale and their results are reported within discontinued operations.
On 27 June 2005 an announcement was made concerning the disposal of the Cobham Fluid Systems products division, which produces equipment for handling specialist fluids and gases for non-airborne applications.
The disposal of this division was completed on 1 August 2005, on which date control of the divisions operations passed to the acquirer.
On 13 September 2005 an announcement was made to dispose of the Fluid and Air group of companies.
The group designs and manufactures hydraulic and air distribution assemblies, composite struts and shafts, and fuel pumps and fuel components.
The disposal was finally completed on 17 November 2005, on which date control of the whole of the Fluid and Air group operations passed to the acquirer.
The results of the discontinued operations for the year, or to the date of disposal, were as follows: 2005 2004 Fluid and Other discontinued Total discontinued Fluid and Other discontinued Total discontinued m Air group operations operations Air group operations operations Revenue 93.5 26.6 120.1 116.8 29.9 146.7 Cost of sales 80.5 19.1 99.6 98.7 21.5 120.2 Distribution costs 3.3 2.6 5.9 5.4 4.1 9.5 Administrative expenses 5.2 2.4 7.6 7.6 3.2 10.8 Other income 0.7 0.7 Operating profit 4.5 3.2 7.7 5.1 1.1 6.2 Finance income and expense 0.1 0.2 0.3 Profit before tax 4.6 3.4 8.0 5.1 1.1 6.2 Tax 1.2 0.7 1.9 1.6 0.3 1.9 Profit for the year after tax 3.4 2.7 6.1 3.5 0.8 4.3 Profit on disposal before tax 4.9 Tax on profit on disposal 3.6 Total profit after taxation from discontinued operations 7.4 4.3 70 Cobham plc 31.

Contingent liabilities As at 31 December 2005, the parent company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business entered into for, or on behalf of, certain Group undertakings.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision has been made within the Group consolidated financial statements or within those of the relevant subsidiary.
As the conditions of the above guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is forseeable and therefore no contingent liability exists at the year end.

Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its consolidated financial statements under IFRS.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004.
As the date of transition to IFRS was 1 January 2004, comparative financial information presented in these financial statements has been re-presented under IFRS.
The Group has taken advantage of the following exemptions under IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of IFRS : Business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2004 have not been restated.
Opening fair values of fixed assets have been deemed as cost as at 1 January 2004, after reviewing for impairment as appropriate.
Cumulative translation differences relating to overseas subsidiaries have been set to zero as at 1 January 2004.
Transition to IAS 32 and 39 has been made effective 1 January 2005 and the 2004 comparatives have not been restated for these standards.
As explained in Note 29 above, errors were discovered during 2005 which have led to the restatement of Net Assets as at 31 December 2003 and the profit for the year to 31 December 2004.
As these adjustments have impacted the transitional UK GAAP position as at 31 December 2003, the comparative IFRS information presented in these financial statements differs to that previously published by the Group.
The impact on the UK GAAP position is as follows: m 2004 2003 UK GAAP Net Assets as previously stated on IFRS transition unaudited 509.7 456.9 Adjustment to provisions 9.0 9.7 Adjustment to corporation tax 2.7 2.9 UK GAAP Net Assets as restated 503.4 450.1 UK GAAP Profit after Taxation for the year as previously stated on IFRS transition unaudited 85.0 Adjustment to cost of sales release of provision 0.7 Adjustment to tax charge for the year 0.2 UK GAAP Profit after Taxation for the year as restated 85.5 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 75 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 40.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued A reconciliation of the previously published unaudited IFRS position at 31 December 2003 and 2004 to that presented in these financial statements is shown in the tables below.

A further 0.7m adjustment was required for the year to 31 December 2004.
In addition, the application of IFRS 3 Business Combinations has resulted in a 20.9m increase in the goodwill balance as at 31 December 2004, compared to that previously reported under UK GAAP, as no amortisation is charged to goodwill under IFRS.
Also, the application of IFRS 3 increases intangibles and goodwill as at 31 December 2004 by 11.8m and the application of IAS 21 results in a decrease of 2.8m on translation.
b The application of IAS 17 Leases has resulted in the reclassification of a number of leases previously held as operating leases, to finance leases and recognition of corresponding finance lease liabilities.
Assets have been recognised with a net book value of 0.9m as at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004, with increases in finance lease liabilities reflected in trade and other payables and other non-current creditors 0.1m and 0.8m respectively as at 1 January 2004 and at 31 December 2004. c Accounting for costs associated with borrowing under IAS 23 Borrowing Costs has resulted in a net decrease in the value of investments in joint ventures and associates of 4.2m as at 1 January 2004 and 3.1m as at 31 December 2004.
This relates to interest costs associated with long-term aircraft leases.
d Under IAS 18 Revenue, other non-current receivables have been discounted by 2.4m as at 1 January 2004 and 2.3m as at 31 December 2004.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 77 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 40.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued e Under IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, all non-functional currency current asset balances are required to be recognised at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Under UK GAAP applicable currency hedges could be applied.
f Although netted under UK GAAP, application of IFRS to the Groups banking arrangements results in a gross up of cash and cash equivalents and overdrafts amounting to 38.3m and 72.4m as at 31 December 2003 and 2004 respectively.
The effect of the application of IAS 21 to the value of cash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 2004 was 2.3m.
g Dividends are recognised only when authorised for payment under IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date.
This change from UK GAAP in the recognition of the year end dividend results in a reduction in dividend liabilities of 22.3m as at 1 January 2004, and 2.2m as at 31 December 2004.
Other standards affecting creditors include IAS 17 Leases and IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
h The total effect of the application of IAS 12 Income Taxes and the tax impact of the first time application of other IFRS and reclassifications on transition to IFRS is a reduction in deferred taxation liabilities of 18.4m as at 1 January 2004 and 4.1m as at 31 December 2004. i Under UK GAAP presentation the deferred tax relating to the retirement benefit obligation is netted against the liability whilst under IFRS this tax is reflected as part of the net deferred tax liability or asset.
This presentational change increases the retirement benefit obligation by 21.1m as at 1 January 2004 and 20.4m as at 31 December 2004.
Additionally, for both periods, the retirement benefit obligation recognised under IAS 19 Employee Benefits is 1.0m higher than that recognised under the equivalent UK GAAP accounting standard due to the change in equity asset valuation methodology from mid price to bid price.
j IAS 21 requires translation differences arising on the results and financial position of subsidiaries which do not report in the Groups functional currency to be disclosed separately in a translation reserve.
k The revaluation reserve which arose under previous GAAP on the revaluation of investment properties is transferred to retained earnings on transition to IFRS under IAS 40 Investment Property, as the investment properties are held at deemed cost under IFRS.
l Accounting for share based payments under IFRS 2 increases the reported Share Option account within Other Reserves as at 31 December 2004 by 2.8m when compared to UK GAAP.
There is also a deferred tax effect relating to potential future tax benefits offset within the retained earnings bringing the total movement in Other Reserves at 31 December 2004 to 4.5m.
m The following cumulative adjustments have been made to the retained earnings: m 1 January 2004 31 December 2004 IAS 10 Dividend Recognition 22.3 24.6 IAS 11 23 and IAS 18 Revenue Recognition 5.9 5.9 IAS 19 Employment Costs 1.5 2.0 IFRS 2 Share Based Payments 0.3 2.4 IAS 38 Capitalisation of Development Costs 1.9 1.4 IFRS 3 Reversal of Goodwill Amortisation 20.9 IFRS 3 Amortisation of Intangibles Recognised on Acquisitions 1.2 IAS 21 Foreign Currency Translation 8.6 IAS 40 Investment Properties 1.7 1.7 Other 0.1 Taxation adjustment 4.6 6.2 13.5 39.5 The effects of IAS 21 are largely offset in the translation reserve.
n Movements in minority interests relate to IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date requirements regarding dividends.
The application of IAS 21, IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement has resulted in the following adjustments to the opening Balance Sheet as at 1 January 2005: Effect of transition m 31 December 2004 to IFRS 1 January 2005 Trade and other receivables non-current 7.3 2.2 5.1 Trade and other receivables current 224.1 3.0 227.1 Cash and cash equivalents 176.0 7.6 168.4 Derivative financial instruments 18.5 18.5 Borrowings total 339.9 0.6 340.5 Trade and other payables 209.7 0.8 208.9 Corporation tax 45.4 0.1 45.3 Deferred tax 16.1 4.7 20.8 7.3 78 Cobham plc 40.

Notes to the reconciliation of the Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 o Movements in revenue relate to the retranslation of foreign currency sales, as required by IAS 21.
In line with IFRS 1, this results only in a reclassification within the income statement.
p See o above and some impacts from IAS 19 Employee Benefits and IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
r Primarily the reversal of goodwill under IFRS 3 Business Combinations and the reversal of IAS 21 adjustments to revenue, partially offset by the amortisation of intangibles recognised on acquisition IFRS 3 and share based payment costs IFRS 2. s Under IAS 1, the share of earnings from joint ventures is required to be reported after tax and interest charges.
This change reverses out in the Finance Income and Taxation lines, having no effect on Profit after Tax.
t Primarily the reversal of the joint venture costs described in note s above.
There is also a small impact from the accounting change described in Note c above.
u This contains the tax effect of the points noted above as well as an additional tax charge under IAS 12 Income Taxes.
Explanation of material adjustments to the cash flow statements for the year to 31 December 2004 Income taxes of 22.9m paid during the year ended 31 December 2004 are classified as a part of operating cash flows under IFRS, but were included in a separate category of tax cash flows under UK GAAP.
There are no other material differences between the cash flow statement presented under IFRS and the cash flow statement presented under UK GAAP.
Approval of financial statements The financial statements were approved by the Board of directors and authorised for issue on 7 April 2006.
