When calculating the diluted earnings per share, the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent is adjusted for the conversion of outstanding options into shares within certain subsidiary entities.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares excluding own shares held in employee benefit trusts, currently not vested, is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, totalling 149 million 2004: 124 million.
Options outstanding at the year end which were not dilutive, but could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future, were 170 million 2004: 208 million.
These were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation due to certain criteria not met at the year end.
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group continued to make further on-market purchases of treasury shares, under its various employee share schemes.
No adjustment has been made to earnings per share in respect of these purchases.
