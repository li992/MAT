Awards are normally subject to a three year performance period, commencing on the date of award.

Grants made during the year ended 31 March 2008, the first year during which 2007 LTIP awards were granted, are detailed below: LTIP awards granted in the year ended 31 March 2008 Total number of awards granted 1,616,395 Weighted average fair value 241.43p Exercise price n a Expected volatility n a Weighted average expected award life 3.0 years Expected dividend yield 0.00% Risk free interest rate n a Details of relevant 2007 LTIP awards outstanding during the year are as follows: Number of awards 2008 Outstanding at the beginning of the year Granted during the year 1,616,395 Transferred in from other Group companies 19,423 Forfeited during the year Vested during the year Lapsed during the year Outstanding at the end of the year 1,635,818 The 2007 LTIP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.4 years.
Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2008 133 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 13 Share-based payment plans continued 2007 CEO Special Award Special Award Grant details Approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Special Award is a one-off conditional share award granted to the Chief Executive equal to 700% of his 2007 08 base salary.
The Special Award is subject to a three year performance period.
50% of vested shares will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being released after a 12 month holding period.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: The performance measures applying to the Special Award reflect those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some elements being more demanding.
The Special Award is split into two layers, each of which vests on a different basis.
For the first layer equal to 200% of base salary, 20% will vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance.
For the second layer equal to 500% of base salary, there will be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% will vest for maximum performance.
Vesting in each layer will be on a straight line basis between these points.
For each layer of the Special Award 50% will vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP.
However, for the TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting will require more stretching performance equivalent to upper quintile.
This has been calculated by the advisors to the Remuneration Committee as outperformance of the mean of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 1.4 i. e. 40%.
Scheme use The Special Award is a one-off grant at no cost.
