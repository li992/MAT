Share based payments continued No share options were granted during the year ended 30 June 2008.
The weighted average share price during the year ended 30 June 2008 was 190.15p.
The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year ended 30 June 2007 has been estimated by the Black Scholes methodology and the principal assumptions required by the methodology were as follows: At 30 June 2007 Weighted average share price 66.8p Expected dividend yields 3.00% SAYE Weighted average exercise price 3.6p Expected volatility 32% Risk-free rate 5.00% Expected life 3 years Executive scheme Weighted average exercise price 54.5p Expected volatility 32% Risk-free rate 5.00% Expected life 1.1 years SIP Weighted average exercise price 23.5p Expected volatility 32% Risk-free rate 5.00% Expected life 2.3 years Prior to 15 May 2007 the Companys shares were not listed on a stock exchange and therefore no readily available market price existed for the shares.
The share price of share option awards granted prior to 15 May 2007 were based on the latest market value agreed with H M Revenue and Customs using an earnings multiples approach based on comparable quoted companies.
Similarly, share price volatility was estimated as the average of the volatility experienced by a comparable group of quoted companies.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Since 15 May 2007, a quoted market price has been available for the companys shares.
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions as shown in note 7.
Events after the balance sheet date Share options During August and September 2008, 3,446,300 Save As You Earn scheme share options were exercised at weighted average price of 3.6 pence per share.
The options were satisfied by a transfer of shares from the Hargreaves Lansdown Employee Benefit Trust.
Dividend On 27 August 2008 the Directors proposed a final ordinary dividend payment of 2.42 pence per ordinary share and a special dividend of 2.324 pence per ordinary share, payable on 30 September 2008 to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on 5 September as detailed in note 11.

Financial instruments Fair value The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values.
Market values have been used to determine the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale financial assets where there is a quoted market price.
Investments in equity instruments which do not have a quoted market price in an active market or whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost which the directors believe is not significantly different than fair value.
Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments a Financial risk management Financial assets principally comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and current asset listed and unlisted investments.
Financial liabilities comprise certain provisions and trade and other payables.
The main risks arising from financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, price risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.
Each of these risks is discussed in detail below.
The Group monitors financial risks on a consolidated basis.
Hargreaves Lansdowns financial risk management is based upon sound economic objectives and good corporate practice.
No hedging transactions have taken place during the years presented.
The Group has designed a framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the Directors have in place risk management practices appropriate to a listed company.
The management of risk within the Group is governed by the Board.
b Market risk Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from adverse movements in interest bearing assets.
There is an exposure to interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
At 30 June 2008 the value of financial instruments on the Group balance sheet exposed to interest rate risk was 68,241,000 2007: 48,092,000 comprising cash and cash equivalents.
A 100bps 1% move in interest rates, in isolation, would not have a material impact on the Group balance sheet or results.
This exposure is continually monitored to ensure that the Group is maximising its interest earning potential within accepted liquidity and credit constraints.
The Group has no external borrowings and as such is not exposed to interest rate or refinancing risk on borrowings.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates.
Short term deposits are also made for varying periods of between one day and six months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective fixed term deposit rates.
As a source of revenue is based on the value of client cash under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to interest rate risk on cash balances held for clients.
These balances are not on the Group balance sheet.
Foreign exchange translation and transaction risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
With substantially all of the Group's businesses located within the UK, and therefore with minimal net assets and transactions of the Group denominated in foreign currencies, the Group is not exposed to significant foreign exchange translation or transaction risk and as such does not hedge any foreign current assets or liabilities.
The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, limiting foreign exchange exposure.
Hargreaves Lansdown Plc | Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2008 66 Notes to the Financial Statements - continued 35.
Financial instruments continued Price risk Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts on the profitability of the Group either as a result of an asset not meeting its expected value or through the decline of assets under management generating lower revenue.
The Group is exposed to price risk on corporate investments held on the Group balance sheet.
At 30 June 2008, the fair value of investments recognised on the Group balance sheet was 1,142,000 2007: 1,169,000.
A 20% move in equity prices, in isolation, would not have a material impact on the Group balance sheet or results.
As a main source of revenue is based on the value of client assets under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to security price risk on investments held for clients.
These assets are not on the Group balance sheet.
The risk of lower revenues is partially mitigated by asset class diversification.
The Group does not hedge its revenue exposure to movements in the value of client assets arising from these risks, and so the interests of the Group are aligned to those of its clients.
In addition, the Group acts as a private client investment manager, unit trust manager and agency stockbroker on a matched basis so its exposure to market price movements in this capacity is limited to when there is a trade mismatch or error, or if one matched counterparty fails to fulfil its obligations.
The impact of these risks is minimised by limits and monitoring controls.
c Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, namely, the risk that it may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
The Group is highly cash generative and holds significant liquid assets.
The Group actively maintains cash balances on short term deposit to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.
The table below analyses the maturities of the undiscounted cashflows relating to financial liabilities of the Group based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date at the balance sheet date.

Financial instruments continued d Credit risk The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk as credit exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Within the Groups Stockbroking operation, the Group is exposed to credit risk from counterparties to a securities transaction during the period between the trade date and the settlement date.
This period is generally three business days.
The Group has credit exposure that extends beyond the original settlement date if the counterparty fails either to make payment or to deliver securities.
These transactions are with financial institutions and clients.
Settlement risk is substantially mitigated as a result of the delivery versus payment mechanism whereby if a counterparty fails to make payment, the securities would not be delivered to the counterparty.
In that instance, the securities could be sold in the market and therefore the economic substance of the transaction is that securities serve as collateral in the case of delivery versus payment trade debtors.
As a result, the risk exposure is effectively to an adverse movement in market prices between the time of trade and settlement.
Other credit risk within the Group is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and the majority represents balances due from other regulated financial institutions where there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and institution.
Credit risk is therefore considered to be limited.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Cash is held with UK banks.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group takes a conservative approach to treasury management and selection of banking counterparties, and carries out at least an annual review of all its banks and custodians credit ratings.

Financial instruments continued Capital management Capital is defined as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves.
Total capital at 30 June 2008 was 70,311,000 2007: 44,495,000 and this capital is managed via the net assets to which it relates.
Regulatory capital is determined in accordance with the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive prescribed in the UK by the Financial Services Authority FSA, and the Groups regulatory capital is divided into two tiers: Tier 1 capital, which is the total of issued share capital, retained earnings and reserves created by appropriations of retained earnings, net of the book value of goodwill and other intangible assets: and Tier 2 capital, which is unrealised gains arising on the fair valuation of equity instruments held as available-for-sale.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are i to comply with the regulatory capital requirements set by the FSA: ii to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and iii to maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.
With effect from 1 January 2007, all regulated entities within the Group were required to meet the Pillar 1 regulatory Capital Resources Requirements CRR set out in the Capital Requirements Directive the Directive.
The CRR is the higher of i the fixed overhead requirement and ii the sum of the credit risk capital requirement and the market risk capital requirement.
Further requirements of the Directive under Pillar 2 operational risk and Pillar 3 market disclosure came into effect on 1 January 2008 which has affected the methodology used to determine the Groups regulatory capital requirements.
The Directive requires continual assessment of the Groups risks in order to ensure that the higher of Pillar 1 and 2 requirements is met, the objective being to ensure that the regulated firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks.
The Group has completed its assessment of regulatory capital requirements for 2008 including its Individual Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP under Pillar 2, which is a forward looking exercise that includes stress testing on major risks, such as a significant market downturn, and identifying mitigating action.
The ICAAP has been discussed with the FSA, but is subject to formal review and approval by it during 2008.
The Group does not foresee any significant change in the level of capital required to satisfy prudential regulations, approximately 7million.
All of the regulated firms maintained surplus regulated capital throughout the year.
The regulatory capital surplus in the Group was 25 million at 30 June 2008 2007: 18 million.
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored by the Groups management.
