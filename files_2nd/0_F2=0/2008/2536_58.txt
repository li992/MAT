Share-based payments The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the 52 weeks ended 28 September 2008 is 8.4m 2007: 8.1m.
All of that expense arises from transactions which are expected to be equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
The Britvic Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is an all-employee plan approved by HMRC.
The plan allows for annual awards of free ordinary shares with a value of 3% of salary subject to HMRC maximum limits together with an offer of matching shares on the basis of one free matching share for each ordinary share purchased with a participants savings, up to a maximum of 75 per four week pay period.
Employees are entitled to receive the annual free share award provided they are employed by the Company on the last day of each financial year and on the award date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Awards made during the year are shown in the table below.
The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the intrinsic value of the shares.
Number of shares 2008 2007 Annual free shares award 477,862 582,762 Matching shares award one free share for every ordinary share purchased 422,225 455,349 The Britvic Executive Share Option Plan Option Plan The Option Plan allows for options to buy ordinary shares to be granted to selected employees.
The option price is the average market price of Britvic plcs shares on the three business days before the date of grant.
Options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance condition and remain exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.
The performance condition requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the options to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% per annum in excess of RPI growth, 40% of the options will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the Company, an optionholder who exercises his her option may receive a cash payment rather than the ordinary shares under option.
The cash payment would be equal to the amount by which the market value of the ordinary shares under option exceeds the option price.
However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.
The following table illustrates the movements in the number of share options during the year.
Weighted average Number exercise of share price options pence Outstanding as at 1 October 2006 1,582,629 245.0 Granted during the year 1,673,929 245.0 Forfeited during the year 141,426 245.0 Outstanding at 30 September 2007 3,115,132 245.0 Granted during the year 1,169,621 347.0 Forfeited during the year 127,211 245.0 Outstanding at 28 September 2008 4,157,542 273.7 There were no options exercisable at 28 September 2008 or 30 September 2007.
The share options outstanding as at 28 September 2008 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 8.1 years 2007: 8.7 years and the range of exercise prices was 245.0p347.0p.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 67.1p 2007: 44.7p.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model, taking account of the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.

The Britvic Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP allows for awards of ordinary shares to be made to selected employees subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
Different performance conditions apply to different groups of employees.
Awards granted to members of the senior leadership team are subject to a performance condition which measures the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group consisting of 18 companies over a three year performance period.
The awards will not vest unless the Groups position in the comparator group is at least median.
At median 40% will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting at upper quartile.
Awards granted to members of the senior management team will be subject to a performance condition which requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the awards to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% pa in excess of RPI growth, 40% of the awards will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of awards that vest and no awards will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In addition, a transitional award has been made to members of both the senior leadership team and the senior management team shortly after flotation, at levels varying according to seniority.
These awards will vest in tranches over a period of up to three years, subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
The performance condition requires the Companys Return on Invested Capital ROIC to be at least 17% over the performance period for the award to vest in full.
If ROIC is 15% over the performance period, 50% of the award will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the percentage of awards that vest and no awards will vest if ROIC is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the Company, vested awards may be satisfied by a cash payment rather than a transfer of ordinary shares.
