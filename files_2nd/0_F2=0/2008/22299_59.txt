Syndicate 1084s Property Division has exposures through its US direct and facultative accounts including binding authorities and its property treaty account.
In addition to known case ultimate losses, the Group has referred to the following data in arriving at its estimated property exposures: A list of all US zip codes within the footprints of the hurricanes downloaded from the Risk Management Solutions website taking damage factors assigned for physical damage and business interruption.
