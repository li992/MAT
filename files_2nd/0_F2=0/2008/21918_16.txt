"Accounting policies The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ""IFRS""."
"These comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board ""IASB"", together with interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee ""IASC"" that remain in effect, to the extent that IFRS have been adopted by the European Union."
The functional currency of the Group is pounds sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
The financial statements are also presented in pounds sterling.
a Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
"Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice ""the SORP"" for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies ""the AIC"" in January 2003 revised in December 2005 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP."
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiary made up to 30 September each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 no Company Income Statement has been prepared.
c Presentation of Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Income Statement.
In accordance with the Company's status as a UK investment company under Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, net revenue is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Company's compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. d Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where an ex-dividend date is not available, dividends received on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the asset's net carrying amount.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits is accrued to the end of the year.
e Expenses All expenses and interest payable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses have been charged to revenue except as follows: The base management fee of 0.30% has been charged to revenue.
The remainder of the base management fee at the rate of 0.25% or 0.30% if the Company out-performs its benchmark index or under-performs by no more than 5% together with the performance element of the management fee are charged to capital: Expenses which are incidental to the purchase or sale of an investment are recognised within the Income Statement as a capital item: Expenses are presented as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of investments can be demonstrated.
f Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
"In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Income Statement is the ""marginal basis""."
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable 3 4 BEST p22-56 08 P8:BEST p24-54 P2 15 11 08 07:34 Page 35 Annual Report & Accounts 2008 of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Income Statement, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with within equity.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
g Investments held at fair value through profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
In accordance with IFRS recognition and measurement principles, all the Group's investments are classified as investments designated at fair value through profit or loss and are described in these financial statements as investments held at fair value.
All investments are designated as held at fair value upon initial recognition and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or investments for which the market is inactive, are established by using various valuation techniques in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
These may include recent arm's length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost subject to any provision for impairment.
"Investments held by the subsidiary undertaking are classified as ""held for trading"" and are valued at fair value in accordance with the policies above for listed and unlisted holdings."
"Profits or losses on investments ""held for trading"" are taken to revenue."
Foreign exchange gains and losses for fair value through profit or loss on investments are included within the changes in their fair value.
h Movements in fair value Changes in fair value of not held for trading investments are recognised in the Income Statement as a capital item.
On disposal, realised gains and losses are also recognised in the Income Statement as capital items.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and at bank and short-term deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
j Dividends payable Interim and final dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
k Foreign currency translation Transactions in currencies other than sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary items that are fair valued and are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Income Statement.

Changes in its fair value are recognised in the Income Statement as a capital item.
On cancellation, realised gains and losses are also recognised through the Income Statement as capital items.
Interest paid on the Index Stock is charged to the Income Statement as a revenue item.
m Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and are recognised through the Income Statement as revenue items.
This does not comply with the Statement of Recommended Practice for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies, which would require the finance costs of the Debenture Stocks and the Index Stock to be allocated between revenue and capital in the same proportions as the Management Fee.
However, the Directors consider that the treatment adopted, which is consistent with previous years, is the most appropriate given the liquidity of the Company and the nature of the Index Stock.
n Debenture pricing 1 3 The 8 per cent Debenture Stock 2023 and 10 per cent Debenture Stock 2011 are valued at amortised cost under the effective interest 8 8 1 method and secured by a floating charge over all assets of the Company.
Costs in relation to arranging the debt finance of the 8 per 8 cent Debenture Stock 2023 have been capitalised and are amortised over the term of the finance.
Further details of the Debenture Stocks are disclosed in notes 13 and 19.

Financial instruments and capital disclosures Risk management policies and procedures The investment objective of the Company is to achieve capital growth through a focused portfolio of investments, particularly in companies whose shares stand at a discount to estimated underlying net asset value.
The Group's financial instruments comprise equity and fixed interest investments, cash balances and borrowings.
The Group makes use of borrowings to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances or fixed interest investments held.
The Group may also enter into derivative transactions which comprise forward foreign exchange contracts the purpose of which is to manage currency risk arising from the Group's investing activities and quoted options on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings.
The Group has not used derivatives during the current financial year as part of its investment strategy but reserves the right to do so in the future.
The Board sets out its investment policies on page 22.
The Board and the Company's Investment Manager consider and review the risks inherent in managing the Company's assets which are detailed below.

It is not the Group's usual policy to hedge this risk.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling upon receipt.
Over the year sterling weakened against the Group's principal investing currencies, the US Dollar by 12.51% 2007: strengthened by 9.07%, the Euro by 11.42% 2007: weakened by 2.85% and the Japanese Yen by 19.24% 2007: strengthened by 6.25%.
A 5% rise decline of sterling against foreign currency denominated i. e. non sterling assets held at the year end would have decreased increased the net asset value by 21,204,000 or 3.35% of net asset value 2007: 27,248,000 or 3.34% of net asset value.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of investments in fixed-interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: the interest payable on variable rate borrowings: and the fair value of the Company's long-term debt in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances, with short term borrowings being used when required.
The two series of debentures issued by the Company both carry fixed rates of interest and were issued as a planned level of gearing.
These debenture stocks are carried in the Company's balance sheet at amortised cost rather than at fair value.
Hence movement in interest rates will not affect equity but may have an impact on the Company's share price and discount premium which is not likely to be material.
Further information on the debenture stocks is shown in note 13.
The interest liability of the Index Stock moves in accordance with movements in the income returns of the FTSE All-Share Index.
This exposure may be reduced by investing in non-current assets expected to perform in line with the FTSE All-Share Index.

The Company's fixed income portfolio at the year end was valued at 110,285,000 and it had a modified duration interest rate sensitivity of approximately 0.88 years.
A 1% increase decrease in relevant market interest rates would be expected to decrease increase the portfolios value by approximately 970,000, all other factors being equal.
The fair value of the Companys debenture stocks at the year end was 28,582,000 and it had a modified duration interest rate sensitivity of approximately 6.3 years.
A 1% increase decrease in relevant market interest rates would be expected to decrease increase the fair values of the debenture stocks by approximately 1,800,000, all other factors being equal.
Market price risk The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is typical of equity investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with the objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out on pages 16 to 18.
If the fair value of the Groups investments at the year end increased decreased by 10% then it would have had an effect on the Groups capital return equal to 66,377,000 or 41.46p per Ordinary Share 2007: 84,106,000 or 52.54p per Ordinary Share.
Liquidity risk The Company's assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which can be easily sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Unlisted investments in the portfolio are subject to liquidity risk.
The risk is taken into account by the Director's when arriving at their valuation of these items.

The Board, with the assistance of the Investment Manager, regularly monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Group's capital on an ongoing basis.
These reviews include: the level of gearing, which takes account of the Group's position and the Investment Manager's views on the market: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from last year.
The Group is subject to externally imposed capital requirements: as a public company, the Company has a minimum share capital of 50,000: and in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
These requirements are unchanged since last year and the Company has complied with them at all times.
Contingencies, guarantees and financial commitments In June 2007 the European Court of Justice ruled that investment management fees should be exempt from VAT, and in early November HM Revenue & Customs decided not to contest that ruling.
The Board had ensured that appropriate steps were taken to reclaim Back VAT and, following the decision by HM Revenue & Customs, has recognised the Back VAT it expects to recover from the current Investment Manager, Asset Value Investors Limited in these financial statements.
This has been allocated 761,075 as revenuue and 1,305,864 as capital within the Income Statement in line with VAT previously written off on investment management and performance fees previously charged by Asset Value Investors Limited.
The Company is liaising with previous investment managers to determine the quantum of Back VAT which might be recoverable and will continue to pursue recovery of Back VAT as far as is practicable.
Accordingly the Directors consider it inappropriate to recognise any recoverable Back VAT with previous investment managers in these financial statements.
At 30 September 2008 the Group had no contingent liability in respect of any investments carrying an obligation for future subscription or underwriting commitments 2007: nil.
