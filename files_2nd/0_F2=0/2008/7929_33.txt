Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Segmental Information Following the acquisition of Altadis, Imperial Tobacco comprises two distinct businesses Tobacco and Logistics which have been used as the basis for the primary segment reporting below.
The Tobacco segment comprises the manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products, including sales to but not by the Logistics segment.
The Logistics segment comprises the distribution of tobacco products for tobacco product manufacturers, including Imperial Tobacco, as well as a wide range of nontobacco products and services.
Central costs of the Enlarged Group are allocated to the Tobacco and Logistics segments based on managements assessment of the level of support provided to each business segment.
The business segments presented reect the management structure of the Group and the way in which the Groups management reviews business performance.
Transactions between segments are undertaken on an arms length basis reecting market prices for comparable products and services.
Prior to the Altadis acquisition, Imperial Tobacco Group undertook a single principal activity, being the manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products.
Comparative data for 2007 is consequently shown as Tobacco.

This amounts to 427 million based on the number of shares ranking for dividend at 30 September 2008.
At the year end, the shareholders had not yet approved the final dividend and therefore it is not included in the balance sheet as a liability.
The dividend per share gures included in the table above reect the bonus element of the rights issue as described in note 20.
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held to satisfy the Groups employee share schemes and shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by taking into account the weighted average number of shares that would be issued if rights held under the employee share schemes were exercised.
No instruments have been excluded from the calculation on the grounds that they are anti-dilutive.

Intangible Assets continued Intangible amortisation is included within administrative and other expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Supply agreements includes Logistics customer relationships and exclusive supply arrangements in Cuba and Morocco, all acquired under the purchase of Altadis.
Amortisation and impairment in respect of acquired intangible assets are treated as a reconciling item between reported profit from operations and adjusted profit from operations.
The adjustment comprises the amortisation charge for trademarks and supply agreements and the impairment of goodwill.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment review Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs, which have been identied according to the country of operation for distribution units, with manufacturing identied as a single separate unit.
A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives is shown as follows: 2008 2007 Intangible Intangible assets with assets with In s million Goodwill indefinite lives Goodwill indefinite lives European Union 5,089 115 1,838 105 Americas 1,934 88 296 Rest of the World 2,475 523 1,348 273 Manufacturing 712 355 Tobacco 10,210 726 3,837 378 Logistics 1,640 11,850 726 3,837 378 Goodwill has arisen principally on the acquisitions of Reemtsma in 2002 mainly EU and Rest of the World, Commonwealth Brands in 2007 Americas and Altadis in 2008 all regions.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash ow projections derived from three-year financial budgets which are based on managements experience and expectations and are approved by the Board annually.
The compound annual growth rates implicit in these plans, which are used for the initial three years in the value-in-use calculations, are shown below.
Cash ows beyond the three year period are extrapolated using the estimated long-term growth rate of 3% per annum.
An average pre-tax discount rate of 9.7% is used, in line with the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Any reasonable movement in the assumptions of the impairment test would not result in an impairment.
Since their acquisition in January 2008, the intangible assets of Altadis have been subject to a provisional fair value exercise.
This included an assessment of recoverability.
No indications of impairment were identied.
A goodwill impairment of 21 million has been recognised in respect of Sinclair Collis Limited, reecting the decline in UK vending sales as a result of the introduction of restrictions on smoking in licensed premises and anticipated access restrictions.
No impairment charges were recognised in 2007.

Borrowings and Derivative Financial Instruments i Management of financial risk The Group operates a centralised treasury function, Group Treasury, that is responsible for the management of the financial risks of the Group, together with its nancing and liquidity requirements.
It does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions.
The Group Treasury Committee GTC oversees the operation of Group Treasury in accordance with terms of reference set out by the Board.
The Board retains responsibility for all major treasury decisions.
The GTC currently comprises the Finance Director, Corporate Development Director, Group Financial Controller, Cigar BU Finance Director, Group Treasurer and the two Deputy Group Treasurers.
The GTC agrees a framework which sets out the current expectations and boundaries to assist in the effective oversight of Group Treasury activities, covering all key areas within Group Treasury.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, including the provision of a monthly treasury report, which is also provided to the GTC.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument satisfies the hedge accounting rules under IFRS.
The Group hedges underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner.
However, the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting.
As a result, the Group has decided not to apply cash ow or fair value hedge accounting for its derivative financial instruments as permitted under IAS 39.
However, the Group does apply net investment hedging, designating certain borrowings and derivatives as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations.
See section v below for details.
The information contained in sections ii and iii below shows the underlying borrowing position before the effect of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.
com 95 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16.
Borrowings and Derivative Financial Instruments continued Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading transactions denominated in foreign currencies, and the foreign currency cash deposits, borrowings and derivatives.
The Groups policy is to manage its balance sheet translation risk by funding acquisitions and the underlying business assets with borrowings post cross currency swaps in the currency of the underlying net assets.
This results in foreign currency profit from operations being reduced by foreign currency interest costs thereby minimising the translation exposure on foreign currency profits after tax.
In 2008, 77% of revenue 2007: 61% and 74% of adjusted profit from operations 2007: 62% was in markets outside the UK.
Certain sales in these markets are invoiced in currencies other than the functional currency of the selling company, in particular Taiwanese dollars.
Where necessary the Group uses foreign currency derivative financial instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, to reduce exposure to the risk that these sales will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
At 30 September 2008, there were nil million 2007: 20 million notional outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts, the fair value of which was nil million 2007: 0.4 million.
The material foreign currency denominated costs include the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number of currencies.
The Group currently does not consider the foreign exchange risk here to be material enough to hedge after taking into account other US dollar inows across the Group.
The Group issues debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of execution and uses derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps, to change the debt into the desired currency.
At 30 September 2008, approximately 13% 2007: 12% of adjusted net debt was denominated in sterling, 62% in euro 2007: 70% and 25% in US dollars 2007: 18%.
This excludes the impact of transactional cross currency swaps, maturing between 2011 and 2015, that will convert forecast euro dividends from subsidiaries into sterling.
Cashow and fair value interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cashow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group Treasury monitors the Groups borrowing levels using adjusted net debt which includes cash and cash equivalents, the fair value of the principal amounts due to be exchanged at maturity under cross currency swaps, excluding finance lease liabilities, the fair value of interest rate derivatives and interest accruals.
The Groups financial results are currently principally exposed to gains or losses arising from uctuations in sterling, euro and US dollar interest rates.
In order to manage its interest rate risk on the borrowings, the Group separates the borrowing activities from its interest rate risk management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of execution and uses derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps, to change the debt into the desired currency and into oating interest rates post cross currency swaps shortly after issue.
The Group then transacts interest rate swaps at other times for different notional amounts and different maturities to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate risk.
At 30 September 2008, 38% 2007: 39% of adjusted net debt was at a floating rate of interest, 60% 2007: 57% at a fixed rate of interest and 2% 2007: 4% xed within a set range.
The Group manages its interest rate exposure on a regular basis and reports the position monthly to the Board and GTC.
The Group calculates the impact on profit and loss of a dened interest rate shift for each of the major currencies of borrowings.
The Group also reports monthly the forecast percentage of debt xed over the next ten years to the Board and GTC.
Sensitivity analysis IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis that illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and items recognised directly in equity of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates in relation to all of the Groups financial instruments.
The Group considers that a 100 basis point - movement in interest rates and a 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling represents reasonably possible changes.
The impact on income and equity of these changes is shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of xed to oating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the net investment hedge designations in place at 30 September 2008.
The sensitivity analysis does not reect any change to sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
All financial assets and liabilities held in the functional currency of subsidiary companies are not included in the analysis.
The analysis excludes instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.

The impact in the income statement from foreign exchange rate movements primarily relates to derivative financial instruments that commercially hedge net investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting due to the strict requirements of IAS 39 although they are commercially effective.
This value is expected to be fully offset by the retranslation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net impact on shareholders funds of zero.
This gain or loss is excluded from our adjusted performance measures.
The equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net investments.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk arising from its trade receivables due from customers, as well as from cash and cash deposits and the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments transacted with banks and financial institutions.
The Group has some significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
However, the Group has implemented policies to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and obtains guarantees or other means of credit support to reduce the risk where this is considered to be necessary.
Experience of credit loss has historically been low.
Analysis of trade and other receivables is provided in note 13.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk from financial institutions.
The Group has placed cash deposits and entered into derivative financial instruments with a diversied group of financial institutions with suitable credit ratings in order to manage its credit risk to any one financial institution.

Borrowings and Derivative Financial Instruments continued On 15 September 2008 Lehmans Brothers Holdings announced it was ling for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
The Group had various financial instruments in place with Lehmans Brothers International Europe at that date.
On 2 October 2008 the Group served a default notice to terminate these financial instruments and led a claim for settlement of the outstanding mark to market plus interest for 11.1m.
The mark to market of these financial instruments has been fully provided against at 30 September 2008.
Liquidity risk The Group would be exposed to liquidity risk from having insufficient funds to meet the nancing needs of the Group.
It is the policy of the Group to actively maintain a mixture of short, medium and long-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for the forecast requirements of the Group over the short to medium term.
At 30 September 2008 the Group had 2,053 million 2007: 777 million of undrawn committed facilities, maturing between 2009 and 2012.
As well as forecasting and monitoring the Groups core liquidity needs, the Group Treasury function is in regular dialogue with subsidiary companies to ensure their liquidity needs are met.
Subsidiary companies are funded by a combination of share capital and retained earnings, loans from central finance companies on commercial terms, or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies.
Funds over and above those required for short-term working capital purposes by subsidiary companies are remitted to Group Treasury where practical and possible and are used to pay down debt wherever possible.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and derivatives into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ows which have been calculated using spot rates at the relevant balance sheet date, including interest to be paid.
The carrying value of derivative financial liabilities excludes collateral transferred in respect of certain derivatives with negative fair values for which there is no reasonable basis upon which to allocate future cash ows to maturity groupings.

The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be uctuations in the price of tobacco leaf.
As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations inuence tobacco plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown.
Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price.
The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from a number of different countries, sourcing from various counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.
98 Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2008 Capital risk management The Group manages the capital structure in an efficient manner in order to minimise the cost of capital whilst ensuring that we have access to on-going sources of finance such as the debt capital markets.
The Group therefore manages the capital structure to maintain an investment grade credit rating and has and will continue to take the appropriate measures to maintain this.
For example, where new equity is needed, the Group will issue the minimum required in order to maintain this investment grade credit rating.
This is determined in connection with detailed discussions with credit rating agencies.
Fair value estimation The fair values of derivatives are determined using valuation techniques based on market data such as yield curves and exchange rates to calculate the present value of the estimated future cash ows at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year are approximate to their carrying value.
For liabilities with a maturity of more than one year the fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.

Borrowings and Derivative Financial Instruments continued iv Derivative financial instruments IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument satisfies the hedge accounting rules under IFRS.
The Group separates the borrowing activities from its interest rate risk management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of execution and using derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps, to change the debt into the desired currency and into oating interest rate immediately after issue.
The following table sets out the derivative financial instruments held by the Group at 30 September 2008, and demonstrates the Groups use of those derivative financial instruments to manage the Groups foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposures.
The table presents the nominal value of such instruments used to calculate the contractual payments under such contracts, analysed by maturity date, together with the related weighted average interest rate where relevant.
Some of the interest rate swaps have embedded options and assumptions have been made based on market information and third party advice at 30 September 2008 to determine whether such options are likely to be exercised in order to determine the probable maturity date, however the actual maturity date could be earlier or later depending upon future market conditions.
Debt is issued in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of execution.

Gains or losses on the retranslation of these borrowings are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the Groups foreign operations.
Permanent intragroup loans with a fair value of 4,284 million 2007: 4,284 million have been treated as a reduction in investments in the Groups foreign operations.
In addition, cross currency swaps of 1,516 million 2007: 1,516 million and $3,235 million 2007: $nil are considered to provide commercial hedges against investments in the Groups foreign operations.
However, since the derivatives do not meet the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 the fair value gains and losses on these derivatives are recognised in the income statement, but are excluded from our adjusted performance measures.
vi Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all financial liabilities that are carried in the financial statements at amounts other than fair values.
All financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortised cost, other than derivative financial instruments that are carried at fair value.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables are approximate to their fair value and so are excluded from the analysis below.
Derivative financial instruments are excluded as they are carried at fair value.

The derivation of the overall expected return on assets reects the actual asset allocation at the measurement date combined with an expected return for each asset class.
The bond return is based on current market yields.
The corporate bond yield has been reduced to allow for an element of default risk.
The return on equities and property is based on a number of factors including the income yield at the measurement date, the long-term growth prospects for the economy in general, the long-term relationship between each asset class and bond returns, and the movement in market indices since the previous measurement date.

The main UK Group scheme is the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund the ITPF.
An actuarial valuation of the ITPF the triennial valuation, for funding purposes was made at 31 March 2007 by Watson Wyatt Limited.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the ITPFs liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return on the ITPFs existing assets, the rates of increase in pay and pensions and estimated mortality rates.
On the basis that the ITPF is continuing it was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5.20% per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 4.5% and 3.0% respectively.
The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2007 the market value of the invested assets of the ITPF was 2,951 million.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 114% of the benets that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 102% of the total benets that had accrued to members for past service and future service benets for current members.
As there was no actuarial deficiency, it was agreed with the trustees that, with effect from 31 March 2007, no employer contributions are required.
The financial position of the ITPF and the level of contributions to be paid will be reviewed at the next triennial valuation, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2010 and will consider the scheme as at 31 March 2010. www.

Acquisitions 2008 On 25 January 2008 the Spanish Securities Exchange Commission, the Comision Nacional del Mercado fide Valores CNMV, announced that acceptances representing 95.81% of Altadis, S. A. s share capital had been received and Imperial Tobaccos offer to purchase Altadis had become unconditional.
The Group exercised the squeeze-out provision available under Spanish law on 25 January 2008 to compulsorily purchase the remaining shares at the offer price of 50 per share.
The squeeze-out was completed on 21 February 2008.
As a consequence the acquisition has been fully consolidated from 25 January 2008 when the Group obtained control of Altadis.
Through the acquisition of Altadis, the Group acquired direct control of Logista, and pursuant to its obligations under Spanish regulations, the Group made an offer for those shares in Logista not already owned by Altadis.
The offer, at a price of 52.50 per share, completed on 6 May 2008, resulting in a total shareholding in Logista of 96.92%.
The remainder of the shares were subsequently acquired on 9 June 2008 by using the squeeze-out provision available under Spanish law.
In the period from 25 January 2008 to 30 September 2008, the acquired business contributed revenue of 6,916 million and loss from operations of 153 million after charging 245 million for amortisation of acquired intangibles and after one-off charges of 118 million in relation to stock revalued to fair value at acquisition and sold during the period.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2007, Group revenue would have been 23,602 million and Group profit from operations for the year would have amounted to 1,212 million, these amounts having been estimated by including Altadis results for the four months prior to acquisition adjusted to reect the Groups accounting policies and changes in depreciation and amortisation due to fair value adjustments.
In May 2008, the Group acquired Lignum 2 Inc. a seller of quality discount cigarettes in the United States, for a total of 11 million cash.
Its net assets had nil book and fair value, giving rise to goodwill of 11 million.
During the year the Group also acquired interests in a number of small businesses.
The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions amounted to 3 million.
Full IFRS disclosures have not been provided for these small acquisitions as they are not considered to be significant to the Group as a whole.
During 2005 the Group acquired a 43% interest in Skruf Snus AB.
The acquisition agreement included a commitment to acquire the remaining shares and provided the Group with immediate control of its operating and financial policies.
Accordingly the acquisition was accounted for as a 100% subsidiary to reect the substance of the transaction.
In June 2008 the Group acquired the remaining 57% for a consideration of 39 million.
This amount exceeded the 10 million contingent consideration originally booked by 29 million, which has been recorded as goodwill.
No further consideration is payable to the former shareholders.

The principal provisional fair value adjustments are in respect of intangibles, which comprise cigarette and cigar trademarks and supply contracts and have been independently valued using the income method, and property, plant and equipment for which we have engaged independent valuers.
With the exception of premium cigar trademarks that the Directors have determined have an indefinite life, cigarette and mass market cigar trademarks are being amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from 20 to 30 years.
Supply contracts are being amortised over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years.
The goodwill of 6,998 million arising on the acquisition of Altadis represents a strategic premium to acquire Altadis leading positions in the world cigar market and the Western European logistics market, the synergies expected to be realised following acquisition and the assembled sales, manufacturing and distribution workforces.
The Groups share of Aldeasas assets and liabilities had been classied as held for sale upon acquisition and fair valued at that date at 275 million 202 million.
The investment in Aldeasa was disposed of on 14 April 2008 for cash consideration of 275 million at no profit or loss.

Legal Proceedings The Group is currently involved in a number of legal cases in which claimants are seeking damages for alleged smoking and healthrelated effects.
In the opinion of the Groups lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously contested.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group.
In August 2003 the Group received a notice from the Ofce of Fair Trading OFT requiring the provision of documents and information relating to an investigation under UK competition law.
In April 2008 the OFT released a press statement indicating that it proposed to issue a statement of objections SO to a number of retailers and two tobacco manufacturers, including Imperial Tobacco.
Imperial Tobaccos detailed written response to the SO was submitted to the OFT in August 2008.
An oral hearing has been scheduled for 3 December 2008 for Imperial Tobaccos representatives to make submissions to the OFT in defence of its allegations.
No timetable for the remainder of the OFTs enquiry has been published.
In light of the responses it receives to the SO, the OFT may decide to close the investigation, present additional evidence by issuing a supplemental SO, or proceed to an infringement decision.
In the event that the OFT decides that Imperial Tobacco has infringed UK competition law, it may impose a ne, calculated by reference to ITG turnover.
If the OFT were subsequently to make an infringement nding against us, we would be able to appeal the nding to the Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT.
The CAT has the right to conduct a full rehearing of the facts considered by the OFT and overturn or adjust any penalty that the OFT imposed.
There is a further right to appeal from the CAT to the Court of Appeal, which is limited to appeal on a point of law.
In respect of the OFT enquiry, the Group has not provided for any amounts in the consolidated financial statements in this or any preceding year.
We take compliance with competition law very seriously and reject any suggestion that we have acted in any way contrary to the interests of consumers.
