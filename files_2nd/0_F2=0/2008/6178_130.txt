Notes on the Accounts continued 32.
Retirement benefit schemes continued To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Company considered the level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily Government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio and an allowance made for expected expenses.
This gave an assumed rate of 5.80% net of expenses at 31st December 2008.
The actual return on plan assets in the year ended 31st December 2008 was 18.4 m 2007 9.2m.
