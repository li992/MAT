Quintain Estates Annual Report and Development PLC and Accounts 2008 126 Notes to the Accounts continued 19 Obligations under finance leases The Group has entered into a number of leases in relation to its investment and development properties, the carrying amounts of which are disclosed in note 10.
These leases are for fixed terms and subject to regular rent reviews.
They contain no material provisions for contingent rents, renewal or purchase options and escalation clauses nor any restrictions outside of the normal lease terms.
Finance lease obligations in respect of rents on leasehold properties were as follows: 2008 2007 Minimum Interest Present Minimum Interest Present lease value of lease value of payments minimum payments minimum lease lease payments payments 000 000 000 000 000 000 Within one year 819 812 7 815 809 6 From two to five years 3,277 3,243 34 3,277 3,245 32 From five to 25 years 16,387 15,974 413 16,387 16,002 385 After 25 years 42,751 31,478 11,273 43,628 32,317 11,311 63,234 51,507 11,727 64,107 52,373 11,734 20 Financial assets and liabilities The Group is exposed to the following types of risk from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk This note presents information about the nature of the Groups exposure, its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and overview of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board has established a Risk Committee which meets four times a year and is responsible for developing and monitoring the Groups risk management policies.
The Committee reports regularly to the Board in relation to its activities.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risks limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
This function is currently outsourced to Grant Thornton UK LLP.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management control and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the potential financial loss if a tenant or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
It relates principally to the Groups receivables from tenants and other third parties.
Counterparties to financial instruments all have at least an AArating by Standard & Poors.
Non-current receivable In 2007, the Company took the strategic decision to invest in a corporate loan to a private company in order to advance the strength of the Groups position in relation to one of its own properties.
The Company paid 53.2m plus legal costs and arrangement fees for the loan which has a maximum term of 16 years but can be repaid in full or in part at the issuers option at any time.
Interest is payable on the roll-over dates at LIBOR plus 2.5%.
The borrower has met all its interest payments to date and has repaid capital of 7,851,000 in 2006 07 and 2,362,000 in 2007 08.
The loan is secured on a property asset with a commercially acceptable loan to value ratio.
Whilst the loan represents a concentration of risk in a single counterparty, the Group has no reason to believe that it will not be repaid in full.
Trade and other receivables The Groups activities are focused exclusively in Great Britain and the Channel Islands and within this geographical area, its exposure to credit risk arising from trade and other receivables is influenced by the individual characteristics of each tenant.
As at 31 March 2008, the Groups 20 largest tenants within its directly held properties and its joint ventures accounted for 36.0% 2007: 41.5% of the passing rents from these properties.
The Group operates a policy whereby the creditworthiness of each tenant is assessed prior to lease or pre-lease terms being agreed.
The process includes seeking external ratings where available and reviewing financial information in the public domain.
In certain cases, the Group will require collateral to support these lease obligations.
This usually takes the form of a rent deposit, parent company guarantee or a bank guarantee.
Rent collection is outsourced to managing agents who report regularly on payment performance and provide the Group with intelligence on the continuing financial viability of tenants.
Arrears are monitored internally on a weekly basis by the internal property management teams and a strategy for dealing with significant potential defaults is presented on a timely basis by the Head of the Investment Portfolio or the property managers of the Groups various joint ventures to the weekly meeting of the Executive Directors.
Quintain Estates Annual Report and Development PLC and Accounts 2008 127 20 Financial assets and liabilities continued Outstanding tenant balances are reviewed on a quarterly basis for impairment with an allowance of 518,000 being made in the current year 2007: 142,000 as shown in note 2.
In addition to input from its managing agents, the Quercus fund uses an external organisation for monitoring the credit strength of its healthcare tenants.
In relation to iQ, the student accommodation fund in which the Group has a 50% interest, rents are either guaranteed by the universities or collected in advance of each term from students.
Guarantees Where Group companies enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of obligations of other companies within the Group, the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the guarantor will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
In the current and comparative periods, such guarantees did not have any impact on the financial statements.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups operational requirements.
The Group has a 20m working capital facility to manage day-to-day cash movements.
Surplus cash is used to reduce debt.
The Groups policy is to finance its activities using equity and medium term debt, the proportions depending on the profile of the operational and financial risks to the business.
The Group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its convenant but with floating charges over the shares of its subsidiaries.
During the year, the Group terminated its existing bank facilities and refinanced these with a new 620m facility with a number of relationship banks with an average maturity of 5.5 years and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 115 basis points, an increase of 20 basis points over the original facility.
Since the year end, available facilities have increased to 715m.
The key elements of the refinancing were the removal of a covenant limiting investment in joint ventures to 50% of net assets, an amendment to the interest cover covenant allowing a deduction for capitalised interest in arriving at the amount of interest to be covered and a ceiling of 110% to gearing based on net assets as shown on the Groups Balance Sheet as adjusted by deferred tax on revaluation and on the marking-to-market of financial instruments.
Interest cover is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis to monitor compliance with banking covenants.
To ensure compliance, the Board would identify property sales in order to release historic revaluation surpluses and in addition, identify and manage discretionary expenditure.
Market risk In relation to the Group, market risk arises mainly from the impact that changes in interest rates might have on the Groups cost of borrowing.
The weighted average rate of interest of the Groups debt as at 31 March 2008 was 7.0% 2007: 6.6%.
The Group does not speculate in treasury products but uses these only to limit potential interest rate fluctuations.
It usually borrows at floating rates of interest and uses hedging instruments to achieve an interest rate profile where the majority of borrowings are fixed or capped.
As at 31 March 2008, 83.7% 2007: 54.8% of the Groups net debt was fixed or protected.
With the intention of taking advantage of a fall in interest rates, all the Groups interest rate swaps in existence at the start of the year were cancelled and replaced with 225m of interest rate caps at 6.5% with a maturity date of April 2013.
During the year, these were augmented by a further 50m of caps at rates between 5.50% and 5.75% with a maturity date of January 2013.
Further information on the Groups interest rate caps is given in note 21.
During the year, the Group purchased 150m of interest rate swaps with a maturity date of January 2013 and an average swap rate of 4.97%.
One of these, a swap for 50m, has a start date of 3 April 2008.
Further information on the Groups interest rate swaps is given in note 21.
The Group is also exposed to market rate risk through the activities of its joint ventures, which borrow at variable rates and use financial instruments to safeguard against market movements in rates.
This is disclosed in note 21 in respect of the Groups interests in its Quercus and iQ funds.
In addition, the Group has exposure to currency rate fluctuations through its Euro cash deposit of 20.1m following the sale of its sole French property at the beginning of 2007.
In order to limit the Groups exposure to any downward exchange rate movements in Sterling against the Euro, a forward exchange contract on Euros for an amount of 13.5m was entered into at a rate of 1 : 1.45.
At the balance sheet date, this has resulted in an actual cash revaluation gain of 1,555,000 being reduced to a gain of 105,000 due to the recognition of a liability arising from the Euro forward exchange contract.
The unhedged portion of the deposit is retained to meet local liabilities, the most material item being taxation relating to the sale of the property.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base with a view to underpinning investor, creditor and market confidence and sustaining the future development of the business.
The Board receives ongoing reports on the demographic spread of shareholders and maintains regular contact with the principal investors in order to discuss performance and communicate strategy.
The Board monitors the Groups performance in terms of its main financial indicator, total return, at both a corporate and individual asset level, and sets internal guidelines for interest cover and gearing.
The Executive Directors monitor the Groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
In the interest of the shareholders, the Board pursues a progressive dividend policy, subject to the Groups cash requirements.
The Board also encourages employees to participate in the share ownership structure through savings investment plans, the share-based element of bonus arrangements and the various performance related employee share option schemes, all of which it considers best aligns the interest of employees with those of the Group and its shareholders.
From time to time, the Group purchases its own shares on the market.
Such purchases can take the form of treasury shares with the aim of using these as treasury shares to cover entitlements under bonus arrangements and options schemes but also for cancellation on occasions when the Board considers that this course of action would enhance the value of the Group for the shareholders.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements other than those referred to above in connection with the refinancing.

There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
These estimates have been compiled by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings net of interest rate swaps and caps in existence during the year.
The impact on the fair value of the Groups interest rate swaps and caps in existence as at 31 March 2008 of an increase of 50 basis points in interest rates would have been to reduce the loss before tax by 1,500,000 with a credit directly to equity of 3,167,000.
A decrease in interest rates by 50 basis points would have increased the Groups loss before tax by 870,000 with a debit directly to equity of 3,167,000.
In relation to the comparatives for the year ended 31 March 2007, the impact on the fair value of interest rate swaps held at that year end of an increase of 50 basis points in interest rates would have been to increase profit before tax by 2,180,000 with a credit directly to equity of 4,210,000.
A decrease of 50 basis points would have reduced the Groups profit before tax by 2,180,000 with a debit to equity of 4,210,000.
As at 31 March 2008, the Group had a Euro deposit of 20.1m, of which 13.5m was fully hedged.
The balance is retained to meet local liabilities and so the Group has no exposure to foreign exchange movements.
