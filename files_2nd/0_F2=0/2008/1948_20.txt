Three resolutions will be proposed as special business at the forthcoming AGM.
The effect of these resolutions is as follows: Resolution 9 - Authority to directors to issue shares This is an ordinary resolution which authorises the directors to allot unissued shares up to an aggregate nominal value of 1,293,629 which is the difference between the Companys authorised and issued ordinary share capital as at 24 October 2008.
The resolution seeks to renew the authority given to the directors at the AGM in 2008.
This authority, if granted, will expire at the conclusion of the AGM of the Company to be held in 2010.
As at 24 October 2008 the Company held no shares as treasury shares.
At present, the directors only intend to use this authority to satisfy the exercise of awards under the Companys share schemes.
Resolution 10 - Disapplication of pre-emption rights This is a special resolution and is the customary annual request that shareholders empower the directors to allot equity securities for cash without first offering them pro rata to existing shareholders as would otherwise be required by section 89 of the Companies Act 1985.
This power allows the directors to allot equity securities for cash only a up to an aggregate nominal value of 718,456, being approximately equal to 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company: or b in a rights issue or other offer of securities pro rata to shareholders up to the maximum unused amount of the general authority to allot which shareholders are being asked in Resolution 9 to confer on the directors in substitution of the authority granted to the directors by shareholders on 11 January 2008 which expires at the end of this AGM.
Resolution 11 - Companys purchase of its own shares The Companys authority to purchase its own ordinary and preference shares, given at the last AGM, expires on the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM.
This authority was not used during the year.
The directors propose, as a special resolution, that it should be renewed for a further year to expire on the date of the 2010 AGM.
The directors will review opportunities to use this authority in the light of stock market conditions and trading opportunities during the year.
The directors will only make purchases which will reduce the number of shares in issue after paying due attention to the effect on the financing of the Group, its assets and earnings per share for the remaining shareholders.
Any shares purchased under this authority may be cancelled in which case the number of shares in issue will be reduced accordingly or may be held in treasury.
