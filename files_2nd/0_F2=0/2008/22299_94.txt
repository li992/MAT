Contingent liabilities and contingent assets The Company has entered into a deed of covenant in respect of certain of the corporate member subsidiaries to meet each subsidiarys obligations to Lloyds.
These refer to the obligation to deposit Funds at Lloyds FAL to support the Groups underwriting activities.
The Company currently underwrites at Lloyds for the 2009 year of account at an average economic capital assessment of 57.9% 2008 year of account 47.3% whereby FAL must be deposited to this proportion of the Companys overall premium limit OPL for that year.
A fixed and floating charge over the investments and other assets of the Company in favour of Lloyds secures the total guarantee given by the Company under the deeds of covenant subject to limited exceptions.
Lloyds has the right to retain income on charged investments, although it is not expected that Lloyds would exercise the right unless it considers there to be a risk that one or more of the covenants might need to be called and, if called, might not be honoured in full.
Liability under each deed of covenant is limited to a fixed monetary amount.
However, in the event of default by a corporate member, caused by the total value of investments falling below the total of all amounts covenanted, then Lloyds may enforce the charge provisions within the deed of covenant and appropriate a share of the Companys Funds at Lloyds.
This share may be greater than the corporate members proportion of FAL to support the total OPL of the Company.
There is no mechanism for the Company to quantify its exposure in this regard and the Directors consider that the possibility of having this appropriation is remote.
