Notes IFRS basis results The preparation of statutory IFRS basis results and supplementary IFRS basis information is consistent with that applied for the 2007 results and financial statements, except for the effect of the adoption of IFRIC 14 for pension schemes.
EEV basis results The EEV basis results are extracted from supplementary information and are not results that form part of the Groups financial statements.
Supplementary information The results shown above distinguish operating profits based on longer-term investment returns from profits before tax.
The reconciling items are presented in accordance with the Groups policy as described in the Groups financial statements and supplementary information.
Items excluded from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns represent primarily the effects of altered investment market conditions short-term fluctuations and actuarial and other gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes.
For EEV, the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns figure also excludes the mark to market value movements on core borrowings, the effect of changes in economic assumptions and the time value of the cost of options and guarantees.
