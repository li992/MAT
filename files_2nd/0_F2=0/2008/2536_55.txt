Financial risk management objectives and policies Overview The Groups principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, borrowings and overdrafts, cash and cash equivalents.
These financial instruments are used to manage interest rate and currency exposures, funding and liquidity requirements.
Other financial instruments which arise directly from the Groups operations include trade receivables and payables see Notes 19 and 26 respectively.
It is, and has been throughout 2008 and 2007, the Groups policy that no derivative is entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board of Directors review and agree policies for managing these risks as summarised below.
Commodity price risk The main commodity price risk arises in the purchases of prime materials, being PET, sugar, cans and frozen concentrated orange juice.
Where it is considered commercially advantageous, the Group enters into fixed price contracts with suppliers to hedge against unfavourable commodity price changes.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable debt.
The Groups policy is to keep between 25% and 70% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest over a three year time horizon.
To manage this, the Group enters into interest rate and cross currency swaps which are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
At 28 September 2008, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 57% of the Groups borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest 2007: 57%.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is primarily in respect of exposure to fluctuations to the sterling-euro and sterling-US dollar rates of exchange.
The Group has operations in euro-denominated countries and finances these partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings which hedge the net investment in foreign operations.
Additionally cash generation from euro-denominated operations can be utilised to meet euro payment obligations in sterling denominated companies, providing a natural hedge.
The Group also has transactional exposures arising from purchases of prime materials and commercial assets in currencies other than the functional currency of the individual Group entities.
Such purchases are made in the currencies of US dollars and euros.
As at 28 September 2008, the Group has hedged 71% 2007: 70% of forecast exposures 12 months in advance using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Where funding is raised in a currency other than the currency ultimately required by the Group, cross currency interest rate swaps are used to convert the cash flows to the required currency.
These swaps have the same duration and other critical terms as the underlying borrowing.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar and euro exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities and the Groups equity due to changes in fair value of forward exchange contracts and net investment hedges.

It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount disclosed in Note 19.
For transactions that do not occur in the country of the relevant operating unit, the Group does not offer credit terms without the approval of the Head of Finance Shared Services.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group maintains a policy on counterparty credit exposures with banks and financial institutions arising from the use of derivatives and financial instruments.
The level of exposure and the credit worthiness of the Groups banking counterparties is reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with this policy.
Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Liquidity risk The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool.
This tool considers the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets e. g. accounts receivable, other financial assets and projected cash flows from operations.
The objective of the Groups liquidity policy is to maintain a balance between continuity of funds and flexibility through the use of bank loans and overdrafts and long-term private placement issuance.
The bank loans entered into by the Group are unsecured.
At 28 September 2008, 3% of the Groups debt will mature in less than one year at 28 September 2008 2007: 3% based on the carrying value of borrowings reflected in the financial statements.

Capital management The Group defines capital as being net debt plus equity.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and maintain a strong credit rating in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
Quantitative information on equity and net debt can be found in Notes 23 and 31 respectively.
