Employee benefits provision The Groups subsidiary, Chaucer Syndicates Limited CSL, operates a pension scheme the scheme, administered by Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited, comprising a funded defined benefits section providing benefits based on final pensionable salary and, from December 2001, a defined contributions section.
Trustees hold and control the funds of the scheme.
CSL closed the defined benefits section to new members after setting up the new defined contributions section to the scheme in 2001.
The schemes actuary determined contributions to the defined benefits section on 30 April 2007 using the attained age method when the value of the schemes assets was 43.8m.
It was assumed that the investment return will average 6.4% before retirement and 4.9% after retirement, salary increases would average 6.1% per annum, inflation will average 3.1% and future pensions will increase at a rate of 3.0% or 2.3% per annum depending on the period of the service.
The actuarial value of these assets, expressed as a percentage of the liability for benefits accruing to date calculated on an actuarial basis, was 101%, which represented a surplus of 0.3m.
In 2008 the Group contributed 27.6% 2007 25.7% of the members pensionable salaries.
In 2007, the Group also contributed an additional 2.5m.
In 2009, contributions will remain at 27.6% of the members pensionable salaries, with the Group not expecting to pay any additional lump sums.
The total pension contributions in respect of the scheme for the year, including 2.4m 2007 1.4m in respect of defined contribution pension arrangements, were 4.3m 2007 6.4m.
The calculations use the following actuarial assumptions: 2008 2007 % % Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations Rate of increase in salaries 6.00 5.40 Discount rates 5.10 5.50 Weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension costs for year ended Rate of increase in salaries 5.40 5.00 Expected long-term return on plan assets 7.70 7.25 Discount rate 5.50 5.00 PA92 tables are mortality tables produced by The Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMIB every twelve years, based on experience of people who have bought life assurance or annuities through insurance companies.
The most recent twelve-yearly CMIB investigation centred on data collected between 1991 and 1994.
From this data, the CMIB produced its 92 series of tables, which are so called because the data related to the period during or around 1992.
However, recent experience shows that mortality has been improving at a faster rate than that allowed for in the standard projections model associated with the PA92 tables.
As a result, the CMIB has produced new sets of tables, which take into account the faster rates of improvements associated with particular generations.
One of these tables assumes an accelerated improvement until 2020 the medium cohort.
As at both 31 December 2008 & 2007, the mortality tables used were PA92 YOB adjusted by a one year downwards age rating, which meant the scheme was assumed that pensioners would have a one-year longer life expectancy than statistics in the standard PA92 tables, which the Directors believe to be a better interpretation.
All demographic assumptions are those used at the 30 April 2007 valuation.
The current life expectancies in years underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the Scheme are as follows figures in brackets refer to the assumption at 31 December 2007 : Life expectancy at age 60 Male Female Member currently aged 60 27.6 27.6 30.5 30.5 Member currently aged 40 28.8 28.8 31.7 31.7 Chaucer Holdings PLC Annual Report 2008 Back-End-Final-AW 17 4 09 14:36 Page 115 115 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 The assets in the scheme and the expected rate of return were: 2008 2008 2007 2007 2006 2006 2005 2005 2004 2004 %m %m %m %m %m Equities 7.9 25.7 8.0 36.6 7.6 30.8 6.7 27.0 7.0 20.4 Bonds 6.64.1 6.1 4.2 5.3 3.7 4.4 2.8 4.9 2.7 Property 6.4 3.1 7.0 4.1 6.6 3.9 6.2 0.1 6.5 0.1 Cash 2.0 - 5.5 - 5.0 0.5 4.5 2.0 4.3 1.7 Other assets - 0.2 - 0.2 - - 4.5 0.8 - - Total market value of assets 33.1 45.1 38.9 32.7 24.9 Actuarial value of liabilities 42.5 47.2 43.7 40.2 31.7 Scheme deficit 9.4 2.1 4.8 7.5 6.8 The Group bases the assumptions used in deriving the expected return on the scheme assets on market conditions at the period end.

The amounts recognised in the income statement, split between net expenses incurred in insurance activities and other operating expenses, depending on the allocation of costs to Group syndicates or corporate entities are: 2008 2007 m m Current service cost 1.5 1.8 Interest cost 2.6 2.2 Expected return on plan assets 3.5 3.1 0.6 0.9 The actuarial loss recognised in the Statement Of Recognised Income and Expense for the year was: 2008 2007 m m Actuarial gain loss on scheme liabilities in the year 8.0 0.1 Actuarial loss in value of plan assets 16.6 1.3 Total actuarial cost 8.6 1.4 The cumulative actuarial losses recognised in retained earnings are 19.7m 2007 11.1m.
The Group expects to contribute approximately 1.8m to the scheme in 2009 in respect of defined benefit members.
In addition, the Group expects to pay approximately 2.1m in respect of defined contribution members.
The actuarial valuation at 31 December 2008 showed an increase in the deficit from 2.1m to 9.4m, 4.8m to 2.1m in 2007.
Based on active members as at 1 January 2008, this is equivalent to a total employer contribution rate of approximately 27.6% 40.0% at 1 January 2006 of pensionable salaries per annum.
The rates will be subject to possible amendment at subsequent funding reviews.
