Conversion of Legal & General Pensions Limited LGPL to an Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle ISPV On 1 November 2007, LGPL was converted to an ISPV and repaid subordinated debt of 400m to Society.
There was no impact on the IFRS net assets or profit before tax as a result of the ISPV conversion.
Societys long term fund restructure In December 2007, the Group implemented a new capital structure for Society.
A key component was the removal of the transfer formula which limited the annual amount of distributions from Societys long term fund since 1996.
As part of the restructure, it was also announced that the 1996 Sub-fund 321m was merged into the Shareholder Retained Capital SRC.
This increased 2007 IFRS profit before tax by 321m, reflecting the transfer from unallocated divisible surplus to ordinary shareholders equity.
For 2007, 1.7bn was transferred from the SRC into the shareholder capital held outside Societys LTF.
There was no incremental tax in respect of this transfer.
Deferred tax was provided at the incremental rate on the undeclared surplus in Societys LTF represented by the SRC.
For 2007, the incremental rate in respect of the undeclared surplus of 2,047m was zero.
Societys Board of Directors undertook to initially maintain 500m of assets within Society to support the with-profits business.
The amount of the commitment will reduce to 450m in 2009 and then gradually reduce to zero over a period not exceeding nine years.
