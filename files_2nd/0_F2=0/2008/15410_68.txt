The Group is subject to claims and litigation generally arising in the ordinary course of its business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
All such actions are strenuously defended but provision is made for liabilities that are considered likely to arise on the basis of current information and legal advice and after taking into account the Groups insurance arrangements.
While there is always uncertainty as to the outcome of any claim or litigation, it is not expected that claims and litigation existing at the balance sheet date will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.

C. Hahn & Co. On 15 June 2007, the Group acquired 80% of the issued share capital of G. C. Hahn & Co. Hahn.
Hahn provides customised ingredient solutions to global customers.
Hahns primary operations are located in Lbeck, Germany.
It also has production operations in the UK, USA and Australia, and sales offices in 22 countries.
The acquisition agreement allows for the Group to acquire the remaining 20% of the issued share capital prior to 1 January 2020 through put and call options.
The owner of the remaining 20% of the issued share capital is entitled to fixed dividends until the options are exercised.
The Group effectively bears all the risks and rewards for 100% of the business and therefore no minority interest is recognised in the Groups financial statements.
The acquisition has contributed 60 million to sales and 5 million to operating profit post amortisation of acquired intangibles in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition of Hahn had been completed on 1 April 2007, Group sales for the year would have been 3,439 million and Group profit attributable to equity holders of the Company would have been unchanged.
