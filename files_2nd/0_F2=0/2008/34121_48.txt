Equity-settled share option plans The Group granted options to employees under Approved and Unapproved Inland Revenue Share option schemes between 16 November 1999 and 11 November 2003.

If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Since 3 September 2004 the Group has operated an Employee Share Save Scheme SAYE which allows any employee who has more than six months service to purchase shares at a 20% discount to the average quoted market price of the Group shares at the date of grant.
The associated savings contracts are 3 years at which point the employee can exercise their option to purchase the shares or take the amount saved, including interest, in cash.
The scheme is administered by Yorkshire Building Society.
