Overview 02 29 Notes to the consolidated Business review 32 77 Governance 78 101 financial statements Financial statements 102 138 Other information 139 149 1.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those International Financial Reporting Standards including International Accounting Standards IASs and interpretations, collectively IFRS, published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB which have been adopted by the European Commission and endorsed for use in the EU for the purposes of the Groups full year financial statements.
The consolidated and company financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies Consolidated Accounts Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 as amended.
Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 will be filed with Companies House Gibraltar following the Companys Annual General Meeting.
The following standards and interpretations, issued by the IASB or the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC, are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position: IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008 which has been early adopted by the Group in accordance with best practice.
IAS 23 Borrowing Costs effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 which has been early adopted by the Group in accordance with best practice.
IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Amendment Reclassification of Financial Instruments effective immediately.
IFRS 2 Amendment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 which has been early adopted by the Group in accordance with best practice.

The Group is currently assessing the impact, if any, that these standards will have on the presentation of its consolidated results.
Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2008 | 107 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates, judgements and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
These policies, together with references to the related notes to the financial statements, can be found below: Revenue recognition note 4 Intangible assets and impairment of goodwill note 11 Impairment of assets held for sale note 15 Payment processor receivables note 16 Provisions note 21 Regulatory compliance and contingent liabilities note 23 Share-based payments note 28 Basis of accounting The consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than for the valuation of certain financial instruments.
The functional and presentational currency used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is US dollars.
The functional currency is the currency in which the parent company operates and it reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances of the Group.
A number of Group companies operate in local currencies but the amounts involved are not material.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by PartyGaming Plc.
Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Except as noted below, the financial information of subsidiaries is included in the consolidated financial statements using the acquisition method of accounting, and are consolidated from the date of acquisition i. e. the date on which control of the subsidiary effectively commences to the date of disposal i. e. the date on which control over the subsidiary effectively ceases.
On the date of acquisition the assets and liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries are measured at their fair values.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Under section 10 2 of the Gibraltar Companies Consolidated Accounts Act 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting for the Companys acquisition of the controlling interest in PartyGaming Holdings Limited The Companys controlling interest in its directly held, wholly-owned subsidiary, PartyGaming Holdings Limited formerly Headwall Ventures Limited, was acquired through a transaction under common control, as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The Directors note that transactions under common control are outside the scope of IFRS 3 and that there is no guidance elsewhere in IFRS covering such transactions.
IFRS contain specific guidance to be followed where a transaction falls outside the scope of IFRS.
This guidance is included at paragraphs 10 to 12 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
This requires, inter alia, that where IFRS does not include guidance for a particular issue, the Directors may also consider the most recent pronouncements of other standard setting bodies that use a similar conceptual framework to develop accounting standards.
In this regard, it is noted that the United States Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has issued an accounting standard covering business combinations FAS 141 that is similar in a number of respects to IFRS 3.
In contrast to IFRS 3, FAS 141 does include, as an Appendix, limited accounting guidance for transactions under common control which, as with IFRS 3, are outside the scope of that accounting standard.
The guidance contained in FAS 141 indicates that a form of accounting that is similar to pooling of interests accounting, which was previously set out in Accounting Practices Board APB Opinion 16, may be used when accounting for transactions under common control.
108 | PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2008 Overview 02 29 Business review 32 77 Governance 78 101 Financial statements 102 138 Other information 139 149 1.
Accounting policies continued Having considered the requirements of IAS 8, and the guidance included within FAS 141, it is considered appropriate to use a form of accounting which is similar to pooling of interests when dealing with the transaction in which the Company acquired its controlling interest in PartyGaming Holdings Limited.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are carried at cost less any impairment in value.
Foreign currency Transactions entered into by group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate their functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, except for foreign currency borrowings qualifying as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, in which case exchange differences are recognised in a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into US dollars at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place.
All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised directly in equity the currency reserve.
Exchange differences recognised in the income statement of group entities' separate financial statements on the translation of long-term monetary items forming part of the group's net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to the currency reserve on consolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue Revenue from online gaming, comprising poker including emerging games, casino, sports betting and bingo and skins third-party entities that use the Groups platform and certain services is recognised in the accounting periods in which the gaming transactions occur.
Net revenue consists of net gaming revenue and revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals and account fees.
Poker including emerging games revenue represents the commission charged or tournament entry fees where the player has concluded his or her participation in the tournament.
Casino, sports betting and bingo revenue represents net house win adjusted for the fair market value of gains and losses on open betting positions.
Revenue in respect of skin arrangements where the skin owns the relationship with the customer is the net commission invoiced.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is net of certain promotional bonuses and the value of PartyPoints accrued.
Revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals and account fees is allocated to each reporting segment.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Segment information A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services business segment.
In accordance with best practice, the Group early adopted IFRS 8 Operating segments in 2007.
This standard is concerned with the way in which companies report information about operating segments in annual and interim financial disclosures.
The method for determining what information to report is based on the way management organises the business segments within the Group for decision-making purposes and for the assessment of financial performance.
The Group reviews financial statements presented by product type which are supplemented by some information about geographic regions for the purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
Therefore, the Group has determined that it is appropriate to report according to product segment.
Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the Directors best estimate of taxation exposures and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2008 | 109 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences other than where IAS 12 Income Taxes contains specific exemptions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of freehold land and buildings which are stated at cost and are not depreciated.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes directly attributable costs incurred in bringing the assets to working condition for their intended use, including professional fees.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment with the exception of freehold land and buildings, evenly over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated at the following rates: Leasehold improvements over length of lease Plant, machinery, computer equipment 33% per annum Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment, vehicles 20% per annum Where an item of property, plant or equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised where it is incurred to replace a component of an item of plant, property or equipment where that item is accounted for separately including major inspection and overhaul.
All other subsequent expenditure is expensed as incurred, unless it increases the future economic benefits to be derived from that item of plant, property and equipment.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Groups share of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity.
For acquisitions where the agreement date is on or after 31 March 2004, goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on earlier acquisitions was being amortised over its estimated useful life of 20 years.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the unamortised balance of goodwill at 31 December 2004 was frozen and reviewed for impairment and will be reviewed for impairment at least annually.
110 | PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2008 Overview 02 29 Business review 32 77 Governance 78 101 Financial statements 102 138 Other information 139 149 1.
Accounting policies continued Intangible assets Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities arising from business combinations that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets.
The useful economic life of the intangible assets acquired is estimated to be between 18 months and ten years.
Internally generated intangible assets research and development expenditure Expenditure incurred on development activities, including the Groups software development, is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over three to five years.
All other development expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain the related intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cashflows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cashflows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable, management is committed to a sale plan, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
These assets are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less associated costs of sale.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and based, for those share options which contain only non-market vesting conditions, on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a suitable option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2008 | 111 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability.
Up to the point at which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with changes being recorded in the income statement.
The Group records the expense based on the fair value of the share-based payments on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For cash payments made by The Bonita Trust, the charge is recorded when the Trustees commit to make the payment.
Where equity instruments of the parent company or a subsidiary are transferred, or cash payments based on the Companys or a subsidiarys share price are made, by shareholder s or entities that are effectively controlled by one or more shareholder s, the transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment, unless the transfer or payment is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the Group.
Where equity instruments are transferred by one or more shareholder s, the amount recorded in reserves is included in the share-based payment reserve.
Where a cash payment is made, this is recorded as a capital contribution.
Treasury shares The consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of treasury shares is recognised directly in equity.
The cost of treasury shares held is presented as a separate reserve.
Any excess of the consideration received on the sale of treasury shares over the weighted average cost of the shares sold is credited to the share premium account.
Provisions and contingent liabilities The Group recognises a provision in the balance sheet when it has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where the Group has a possible obligation as a result of a past event that may, but probably will not, result in an outflow of economic benefits, no provision is made.
Disclosures are made of the contingent liability including, where practicable, an estimate of the financial effect, uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of outflow of resources, and the possibility of any reimbursement.
Where time value is material, the amount of the related provision is calculated by discounting the cashflows at a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessments of the time value of money and any risks specific to the liability.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged directly to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage currency cashflows and to hedge foreign exchange risk on non-US dollar denominated financial assets and liabilities.
The derivative instruments used by the Group consist mainly of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value calculated using either discounted cashflow techniques or by reference to market prices supplied by banks.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement.
The Group presently does not adopt any form of hedge accounting as described in IAS 39 and does not anticipate any requirement to do so in the foreseeable future.

Accounting policies continued Financial assets The Groups financial assets which are financial instruments are categorised as loans and receivables.
These include trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
There are no financial assets that are classified as held to maturity or available for sale.
A category for in the money derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments held as at 31 December 2008 or 31 December 2007.
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with financial institutions.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
They include unrestricted short-term bank deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months or less.
Amounts held as security deposits are considered restricted cash and are classified as short-term investments.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
They arise principally through the amounts due from payment processors that remit funds on behalf of customers, the prepayment of suppliers and other types of contractual monetary asset and cash and cash equivalents.
They are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue.
They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provisions for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence primarily default or significant delay in payment that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due.
The amount of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cashflows associated with the impaired receivable.
Financial liabilities: The Groups financial liabilities are all categorised as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities include the following items: Client liabilities, including amounts due to progressive prize pools.
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the balance sheet.
Bank borrowings and overdrafts which are initially recognised at fair value, net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
A category for out of the money derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2008 or 31 December 2007.
Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.
The Groups ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the Directors.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Restatement of prior periods Number of shares and earnings per share At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 15 May 2008 an ordinary resolution was passed to consolidate the Companys 4,115,193,850 ordinary shares of 0.0015 pence each to 411,519,385 ordinary shares of 0.015 pence each with effect from 19 May 2008.
The number of shares and earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2007 have been restated as if the consolidation had taken place prior to 1 January 2007.
There is no other effect on the financial statements.
Reanalysis of business segments In the annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2007, bingo was classified as part of casino.
This business segment is now reported separately.

Other administrative expenses allocated to Discontinued operations in the year primarily represent legal costs incurred in respect of the Groups US legal matters and ongoing discussions with the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York regarding the Groups activities before the enactment of the UIGEA.
The Group is discussing with its insurers reimbursement of certain of these costs.
However, as the policy allowing the recovery of these costs has not yet formally been triggered, these costs have been expensed in full during the period.
The Groups insurers have now agreed in principle to reimburse the Company for some of the costs incurred by legal counsel retained by the Directors as opposed to legal counsel retained by the Company, the costs of which are not covered by the policy.
The Company is in the process of confirming this amount with the insurers, although it should be noted that the reimbursement sum is unlikely to exceed $0.5 million.
In 2007 a net $2.7 million was received from payment processors that had previously been provided for as part of the 2006 reorganisation charge.
The credit reflected within reorganisation costs of $0.7 million includes this recovery, net of $2.0 million associated with changes in estimates made in respect of the 2006 reorganisation charge.
Revenue and business segment information For management purposes and transacting with customers, the Groups operations can be segmented into the following four operating divisions: poker including emerging games, casino, sports betting and bingo.
These divisions are the basis upon which the Group reports its segment information.
Unallocated corporate expenses, assets and liabilities relate to the Group as a whole and are not allocated to individual segments.

As a consequence there was a reversal of a creditor in the Groups balance sheet, the charge for which had historically been deducted from revenue, resulting in a corresponding one-off credit of $18.2 million to revenue in 2007.
This adjustment was non-cash and non-recurring in nature.

Of this $2.2 million, $2.0 million related to Discontinued operations and $0.2 million related to Continuing operations.
Prior to flotation, the Principal Shareholders established the PartyGaming Plc Share Option Plan the Nil-Cost Plan for the benefit of the current and future workforce.
Under the terms of the Nil-Cost Plan each option takes the form of a right, exercisable at nil-cost, to acquire shares in the Company, the vesting of which are satisfied by existing shares which had been issued to the Employee Trust.
Following the enactment of the UIGEA, the Company implemented on 29 December 2006 a one-off adjustment to existing incentive awards and also granted new incentive awards by using an additional 40 million shares gifted to the Employee Trust by certain founders of the Company.
As such, the exercise of these options will have no cash impact on the Company.
However, IFRS requires that the fair value of the options be amortised through the income statement over the life of the options.
The charge associated with the nil-cost options decreased from $71.6 million in 2007 to $17.1 million in 2008, primarily reflecting the vesting of nil-cost options granted in earlier periods.
Details of the share option plans are shown in note 28 and within the Remuneration report.

At the period end there were Group companies registered in 12 countries including Gibraltar.
However, the rules and practice governing the taxation of eCommerce activity are evolving in many countries.
It is possible that the amount of tax that will eventually become payable may differ from the amount provided in the financial statements.
The Group has received indemnities from the Principal Shareholders in connection with certain potential historic corporate taxation liabilities.
The Directors consider the likelihood of any such liability arising to be remote.
Accordingly, neither has a provision for any such potential taxation been made, nor has an asset been recognised in respect of the indemnity.
Factors that may affect future tax charges In Gibraltar, the Group benefits from the exempt company regime.
The Gibraltar exempt company regime will be phased out by 31 December 2010: assessable income is taxed in Gibraltar at the mainstream corporation tax rate.
In India, the Group benefits from a tax holiday on income from qualifying activities until March 2010: under current rules assessable income is taxed in India at approximately 34%.
A Minimum Alternative Tax of 11.33% applies.
Fringe benefit tax is payable at approximately 34% on a proportion of specified benefits provided or deemed to have been provided to past and present employees.

Clean EBITDA and Clean earnings per share are performance measures used internally by management to manage the operations of the business and remove the impact of one-off and non-cash items.
They are therefore calculated before reorganisation costs, non-cash charges relating to share-based payments, non-recurring adjustment to revenue and release of tax provision.
Clean net earnings attributable to equity shareholders is derived as follows: 2008 2007 Continuing Discontinued Continuing Discontinued operations operations Total operations operations Total Year ended 31 December $million $million $million $million $million $million Earnings loss for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings per share being profit attributable to equity holders of the parent 77.8 10.9 66.9 13.9 27.7 41.6 Reorganisation costs income 1.7 1.7 0.7 0.7 Earnings loss before reorganisation costs 79.5 10.9 68.6 13.9 27.0 40.9 Share-based payments 21.7 21.7 79.3 2.0 81.3 Non-recurring adjustment to revenue 18.2 18.2 Release of tax provision 10.8 53.7 64.5 Clean net earnings loss 101.2 10.9 90.3 64.2 24.7 39.5 PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2008 | 119 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 10.

Development expenditure represents software infrastructure assets that have been developed and generated internally.
They are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of between three and five years.
During the year the Group paid a final deferred consideration of Euro 21.0 million, plus interest of Euro 1.3 million, in relation to acquisitions made in prior periods.

Intangible assets continued Goodwill is allocated to the following cash generating units CGUs : As at 31 December $million Gamebookers 86.4 EOL IOG 37.6 PartyPoker 8.6 As at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008 132.6 The goodwill in relation to the PartyPoker CGU noted above arose from the 8.5% minority interest buy-out by the Group in 2004.
Post-acquisition, this was treated as part of the overall poker operations of the Group.
As such, the directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use.
The recoverable amounts of the other CGUs above have been determined from value in use calculations based on cashflow projections covering the following ten year period.
The Group believes that going beyond five years cashflows in the value in use calculations is appropriate given the Group is an established business and is a leader in a growth industry.
The projections include the formally approved budget for 2009 and detailed projections covering the following two year period to 31 December 2011.
Key assumptions used in the projections are as follows: Gamebookers EOL IOG As at 31 December 2008 2007 2008 2007 Discount rate 9.6% 8.2% 8.5% 7.6% Operating margin 33.0% 28.0% 32.0% 27.0% Growth rate 12.0% 10.0% 17.0% 15.0% Operating margins have been based on past experience and future expectations in the light of anticipated economic and market conditions.
Discount rates are based on the Group's weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect management's assessment of specific risks related to the CGUs.
Growth rates have been based on estimates published in January 2009 by H2 Gambling Capital, an independent consultant to the online gambling industry.
The excess of the recoverable amounts over the carrying value for the other CGUs are as follows: 2008 2007 As at 31 December $million $million Gamebookers 15.7 35.5 EOL IOG 190.4 114.5 206.1 145.0 The break-even analysis with other key assumptions remaining the same for the other CGUs are shown in the following table: As at 31 December 2008 Gamebookers EOL IOG Break-even discount rate 13.1% 58.6% Break-even operating margin 26.6% 0.9% Break-even growth rate 7.0% 35.9% PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2008 | 121 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.

Contingent liabilities From time to time the Group is subject to legal claims and actions against it.
The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of such claims and actions.
Regulatory issues As part of the Boards ongoing regulatory compliance process, the Board continues to monitor legal and regulatory developments and their potential impact on the business and take appropriate advice in respect of these developments.
Following the enactment of the UIGEA, the Group stopped taking any deposits from customers in the US and barred such customers from wagering real money on all of the Groups sites.
Notwithstanding this, the actions taken by certain US regulatory authorities suggest that there remains a residual risk of an adverse impact arising from the Group having had customers in the US prior to the enactment of the UIGEA.
Furthermore, the Group is aware that certain US regulatory authorities have made enquiries of banks and other financial advisers that have had involvement with the internet gaming industry.
Certain customary indemnities have been given by the Company to its advisers in connection with the Companys initial public offering in June 2005 and other assignments, and claims under such indemnities cannot be ruled out.
The Group has not, however, received notice of any such claim to date.
On 4 June 2007, the Company announced that it had initiated discussions with the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York USAO.
These discussions have made good progress and the Company continues to negotiate the terms of a possible settlement with the USAO.
However, the terms of any settlement have not yet been finalised and there can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached between the Company and the USAO.
The Board believes that further disclosure in relation to this matter including any disclosure of any range of potential settlement would be prejudicial to the Groups interests.
Litigation The Group is the defendant in a US action which is based on alleged collusion taking place on the Groups online poker tables.
This action has been brought by two individual plaintiffs who are seeking class certification.
The class seeking to be represented comprises poker customers in the US who from 1 January 2002 played real money games on the Groups sites.
The Group believes the action to be speculative, without merit and open to challenge on a number of grounds.
The Group had not hitherto submitted to US jurisdiction and therefore the action had not been contested.
In light of a number of factors, not all of which pertained at the time of the decision not to contest, the Group decided to seek to challenge the proceedings and accordingly sought and was granted permission to enter a defence and contest the action on the merits.
The Group also applied to have the action dismissed, and the judge granted that order and dismissed the proceedings with prejudice on 30 September 2008.
Subsequently, the plaintiffs have appealed the judges decision.
The Board believes that the disclosure of a range of potential liability, if any, would be prejudicial to the Groups interests.
Share capital Issued and fully paid Number $ million Ordinary shares as at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008 103,866 411.5 Shares issued are converted into US dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of issue.
The issued and fully paid share capital of the Group amounts to $103,866 and is split into 411,519,385 ordinary shares.
The share capital in UK sterling is 61,727.91 and translates at an average exchange rate of 1.6822 US dollars to 1 sterling.
As at 31 December 2008, 6,684,959 2007: 11,222,665 ordinary shares were held as treasury shares by the Employee Trust.
Authorised share capital and significant terms and conditions The total authorised number of shares comprises 500 million ordinary shares with a par value of 0.015 pence each.
All issued shares are fully paid.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends when declared and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.
The Trustee of the Employee Trust has waived all voting and dividend rights in respect of shares held by the Employee Trust.
The share capital is shown on the basis that it has been in issue throughout the period.
There were no changes to the authorised share capital during the period.
On 9 May 2008 the Company issued 8 additional ordinary shares in order to increase the total number of shares in issue to a number divisible by a factor of 10.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 15 May 2008 an ordinary resolution was passed to consolidate the Company's 4,115,193,850 ordinary shares of 0.0015 pence each to 411,519,385 ordinary shares of 0.015 pence each with effect from 19 May 2008.

Capital contribution reserve is the amount arising from share-based payments made by The Bonita Trust and cash held by the Employee Trust.
Retained earnings are the cumulative net gains and losses recognised in the consolidated income statement after the effect of share-based payments.
In prior years, the amounts arising from share-based payments made by the Group were shown in a separate reserve.
Currency reserve represents the gains losses arising on retranslating the net assets of overseas operations into US dollars.
The other reserve of $825.4 million is the amount arising from the application of accounting which is similar to the pooling of interests method, as set out in the Groups accounting policies.
Under this method of accounting, the difference between the consideration for the controlling interest and the nominal value of the shares acquired is taken to other reserves on consolidation.
As a result, the share capital and reserves reflect PartyGaming Plcs share capital and the retained earnings for each of the periods ended 31 December 2007 and 2008 and reflects the cumulative profits as if the current Group structure had always been in place.

Financial instruments and risk management In common with other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
This note describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantive changes in the Groups exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods, unless otherwise stated in this note.
Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows: trade receivables: prepayments: cash at bank and cash equivalents: short-term investments: bank loans: trade payables: client liabilities and progressive prize pools: and foreign exchange contracts.
Foreign exchange contracts are regularly used in the normal course of business but none were outstanding as at 31 December 2008 or at the prior period end.
The Group operates a sports betting business and always has open bets.
As at 31 December 2008 and at the prior period end the fair market value of open bets was not material.
Other financial derivative instruments are permitted to be used by the Group, but none were used in the period ended 31 December 2008 or in the prior period.
Management controls and procedures The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating the required processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Groups treasury department under the auspices of the Group Treasury Committee see below.
As such, the Groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the Groups treasury department.
The treasury department is mandated to execute conventional forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps in order to manage these underlying risks.
No other derivatives may be executed without written authority from the Board at which point an explanation of the accounting implications would also be given.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis which are recommended and subsequently monitored by the Group Treasury Committee.
The Group Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Finance Director.
These polices include benchmark exposures and hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The Group risk management policies would also be reviewed by the Board following, for example, significant changes to the Groups business.
Exposures are monitored and reported to management on a weekly basis, together with required actions when tolerance limits are exceeded.
The internal control procedures and risk management processes of the treasury department are also reviewed periodically by the internal audit function.
The last internal control review was undertaken during 2007 and the procedures and processes were deemed satisfactory.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible, without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below: Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of its working capital as well as the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
In essence, it is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups treasury department ensures that the Groups cash and cash equivalents and amounts due from payments service providers PSPs exceed its combined client liabilities at all times.
This excess is defined as the Client Liability Cover.
Client liabilities principally represent customer deposits and progressive prize pools.
The Group Treasury Committee is advised of cash balances, investments, foreign currency exposures, interest income, interest expense, amounts due from PSPs, Client Liability Cover and counterparty exposures on a weekly basis.
PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2008 | 127 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 26.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The Group imposes a maximum debt limit of $150 million that may mature in any one year to ensure that there is no significant concentration of refinancing risk.
The Group was required to make a final payment Euro 22.3 million on 1 February 2008 representing a retention to the vendors of the Gamebookers business activity acquired in August 2006.
This payment was met out of existing cash resources whilst maintaining a positive Client Liability Cover.
Management monitors liquidity to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to the Group.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
Capital risk In common with many internet companies that have few physical assets, the Group has no policy as to the level of equity capital and reserves other than to address statutory requirements.
The primary capital risk to the Group is the level of debt relative to the Groups net income.
Accordingly, the Groups policy is that gross debt should not exceed $300 million and that the leverage ratio of gross debt clean EBITDA should be less than 1.5x.
Since April 2007 the Group has had no bank loans nor entered into any credit facilities.
Details of the Groups dividend policy is disclosed in the Charimans Statement and also on page 39 of this Annual Report under the heading Review of 2008. Credit risk Operational: The Groups operational credit risk is primarily attributable to receivables from PSPs and from customers who dispute their deposits made after playing on the Groups websites.
Prior to accepting new PSPs and wherever practicable, credit checks are performed using a reputable external source.
Senior management monitors PSP balances on a weekly basis and promptly takes corrective action if pre-agreed limits are exceeded.
For PSPs that do not have a formal credit rating, an internal rating system is used, based on such factors as industry knowledge, balance sheet strength, profitability, customer diversification, geographic diversification, long-term stability, management credibility and historic payment track record.
These internal ratings are monitored and reviewed on a monthly basis by the Director of Payment Processing.
An internal rating of one is assessed as very strong whilst a rating of five is assessed as weak.
2008 2007 As at 31 December $million $million 1 Very Strong 0.1 2 Strong 18.2 1.3 3 Good 7.5 19.8 4 Adequate 8.2 5 Weak 0.4 Payment Service Providers amounts due 25.8 29.7 Management consider the maximum credit exposure on amounts due from PSPs to be the carrying amount.
As at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 there were no overdue amounts due from PSPs which had not been impaired, nor were there any partially impaired amounts.
There is an inherent concentration of risk with PSPs, which are not investment grade banks, in that the majority derive most of their income from the online gaming sector.
To this end, where practicable and economic, the Group seeks to substitute non-investment grade PSPs with investment grade, or at least better quality, PSPs.
The table below sets out the movement in the impairment of amounts due from PSPs.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Cash investments: As of October 2008, wherever possible and commercially practicable the Group invests cash through major financial institutions where the counterparty has a one year credit default swap CDS rate as quoted by Bloomberg, of no more than 2% or, in the case of pooled money market funds, a minimum long-term credit rating of AAA on the principal, as defined by Moodys rating agency.
Investments are allowed only in highly liquid securities.
The Group maintains monthly operational balances with banks that do not meet this credit rating in Israel, Bulgaria and India to meet local salaries, expenses and legal requirements.
These balances are small and are kept to a minimum.
Cash and cash equivalents Short-term investments 2008 2007 2008 2007 As at 31 December $million $million $million $million AAA money market funds 103.0 34.8 Counterparties with CDS less than 0.5% 80.6 8.5 Counterparties with CDS between 0.5% and 1% 30.1 Counterparties with CDS between 1% and 1.5% 24.6 8.3 Counterparties with CDS between 1.5% and 2% 28.2 Counterparties without CDS or CDS more than 2% 7.2 3.9 193.1 119.3 8.3 8.5 Prior to October 2008 and at 31 December 2007 credit risk was managed purely by reference to Moody's rating agency.
However the past year has shown that published credit ratings for banks have proven to be unreliable following the default of several significant investment grade banks.
Consequently, in October 2008, the Group ceased using such ratings for establishing counterparty limits and now uses CDS rates where possible, which the Group believes provide a more accurate assessment of the markets view as to the probability of default by a counterparty over the next year.
The following table shows the analysis of cash investments purely by reference to Moody's rating agency and is for illustrative purposes only.
Cash and cash equivalents Short-term investments 2008 2007 2008 2007 As at 31 December $million $million $million $million Counterparties with AAA credit rating 103.0 34.8 Counterparties with AAto AA credit rating 82.9 80.6 8.3 8.5 Counterparties with credit rating below AA- 7.2 3.9 193.1 119.3 8.3 8.5 The treasury department may only make the following cash investments, without prior written authority by the Board: cash deposits: pooled money market funds: certificates of deposit: and commercial paper.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest-bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows on its long-term debt finance and cash investments through the use of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors.
Interest rate risk Given the Groups net cash position, the Group considers that its exposure to interest rate risk is negligible.
The Groups current net cash position is maintained on a fully floating basis.
In the event of a strategic change in the debt position of the Group, the interest rate management policy would be reviewed.
PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2008 | 129 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 26.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Currency risk Transaction and currency liability exposures: The Groups policy is that all material transaction and currency liability exposures are economically and fully hedged using foreign exchange contracts and or by holding cash in the relevant currency.
Additionally, the Group has discretion to hedge some or all of its forecast sterling operational costs in Gibraltar and the UK for up to 12 months.
No other forecast cashflows are hedged.
The Group also economically hedges material committed exposures such as capital expenditure unless the period between commitment and payment is short less than one month.
Currency exposures are monitored by the Group Treasury Committee on a weekly basis.
A $5 million currency tolerance limit between US dollars and any other currency is permitted in order to avoid executing low value and uneconomic foreign exchange contracts.
Net investment exposures: The Group has the flexibility to hold debt in currencies other than US dollars in order to hedge non-US dollar investments up to 50% of the net investment value.
In managing the mix of ongoing debt exposure the Group takes into account prevailing interest rates in particular currencies and the potential impact on Group earnings ratios.
The Group had no material non-US dollar debt which hedged net investments during the years ended 31 December 2008 or 31 December 2007.
Sensitivity analysis to currency and interest rate risk The Group has adopted a sensitivity analysis that measures the change to the fair value of the Groups financial instruments and any resultant impact on the Groups income statement of either: an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% in market interest rates including the annualised interest income impact of variable rate interest-bearing financial instruments, or a 10% strengthening or weakening in the US dollar against all other currencies from the rates applicable at 31 December 2008 or 31 December 2007.
The Group is exposed to interest rate movements since it holds significant amounts of cash at floating rates as well as cash equivalents to meet client liability obligations that are non-interest bearing.
The Group is exposed to currency movements in the US dollar, arising out of changes in the fair value of financial instruments which are held in non-US currencies.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the possible impact of market risk, assuming that specified changes occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to other developments in financial markets that may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered as a projection of likely future events and losses.

The Group also retains certain insurable risk where external insurance is not considered an economic means of mitigating these risks.

Related parties continued Bonita Trust The Bonita Trust was established in Gibraltar in 2004 in effect by the Groups Principal Shareholders to benefit the communities where the Group and its employees and service providers operate.
The Bonita Trust is operated by an independent professional trustee.
The Bonita Trust has philanthropic objectives and supports medical, cultural and educational programmes, principally directed to benefit the communities of Gibraltar, India and the UK.
In addition, employees of PartyGaming and their families are a beneficiary class of The Bonita Trust.
In December 2006 and subsequently, The Bonita Trust made or committed to make payments to certain individuals that were employed or had previously been employed by the Group.
These payments were made independently of the Group and were over and above the amounts that the Board had already determined should be paid by the Group to those employees and former employees.
However, as these payments were based primarily on the Companys share price, the Board considers these to fall under the criteria for Share-based Payments under IFRS 2.
As a result, the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2007 included a charge totalling $2.2 million of which $2.0 million related to Discontinued operations as if such amounts had been paid by the Group itself.
A corresponding amount was recorded as a capital contribution in the Groups balance sheet.
No further commitments were made during the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Bonita Trust regularly makes donations and other payments in respect of its other objectives.
Disclosure of the existence of such payments has been made as it is possible that the Groups name may be linked with them.
It is emphasised that neither The Bonita Trust nor any person or entity connected with The Bonita Trust sought any advice from the Group, its Directors or key management in deciding whether these payments should be made.
In addition, none of the payments were made in respect of any obligations incurred, or services received by the Group, nor did they fall within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
Consequently, no entries have been made in the Groups financial statements in respect of these payments.
Directors and key management Key management are those individuals who the Directors believe have significant authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group.
The aggregate short-term and long-term benefits, as well as share-based payments of the Directors and key management of the Group are set out below: 2008 2007 Year ended 31 December $million $million Short-term benefits 16.4 18.0 Share-based payments 14.7 63.0 31.1 81.0 At the year end an aggregate balance of $1.4 million 2007: $0.3 million was due to Directors and key management.
The Groups subsidiaries continued to provide the following property arrangements during the period: the former Chief Executive Officer had two furnished properties available for his use in Gibraltar which the Directors believe have a fair rental value of approximately $150,000 per annum plus service and utility costs : and the former Chief Executive Officer had an additional property available for his use at fair rental value, but he did not avail himself of the property and the property has been leased to other employees and third parties at fair rental value.
In 2007 unfurnished property was leased to the Group Finance Director at an annual lease rental of 44,400 $84,000, which the Directors believe was the fair rental value of the property.
With the approval of the Companys shareholders this property was sold at fair market value of 1.2 million $2.4 million to the Group Finance Director on 25 May 2007.
The Group purchased telecommunication and utility services of $5.9 million 2007: $5.0 million from companies for whom a Board member is a Director on an arms length basis, with amounts owed at 31 December 2008 of $0.3 million 2007: $0.2 million.
