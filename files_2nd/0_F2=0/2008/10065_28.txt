If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets of cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount.

For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
