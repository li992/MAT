Financial statements Notes to the parent company financial statements 1.
Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified for derivative financial instruments which are held on the balance sheet at fair value see Derivative financial instruments below.
They comply with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Fixed asset investments The Companys investments in group undertakings are held at cost less provision for impairment.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised, subject to certain exceptions, in respect of all material timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and for tax purposes.
Those timing differences recognised include accelerated capital allowances and short-term timing differences.
Timing differences not recognised include those relating to the revaluation of fixed assets in the absence of a commitment to sell the assets, the gain on sale of assets rolled into replacement assets and the distribution of profits from overseas companies in the absence of any commitment by the Company to make the distribution.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Employee benefits i Pension obligations The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Companys defined benefit arrangements is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets, shown net of deferred tax.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified actuaries.
The current service cost of providing pension benefits to employees, together with the cost of any benefits relating to past service, is charged to operating profit and included in staff costs.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount of finance cost or income adjacent to interest.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
For the Companys defined contribution arrangements, the charge against profit is equal to the amount of contributions payable.
ii Share-based compensation The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, whereby, subject to meeting any relevant conditions, employees are awarded shares or rights over shares.
The cost of such awards is measured at fair value, excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions, on the date of grant.
The expense is generally recognised over the vesting period and is adjusted for the estimated effect, on the number of shares that will eventually vest, of non market-based vesting conditions and forfeitures due to employees leaving the employment of the Company.
Fair values are calculated using a combination of Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo simulation models depending on the conditions attached to the particular share scheme.
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS 20 in respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply FRS 20 only to those equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
Own shares The cost of own shares held in treasury treasury shares or by the Companys employee share trusts for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of the Groups employee share plans are deducted from shareholders funds in the Company and Group balance sheet.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost taken to revenue reserves except where the proceeds exceed the consideration paid, where the excess is transferred to the share premium account.
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions, adjusted for the effects of any hedging arrangements.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the relevant rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
This applies to the euro loan from Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH, which is a monetary item, converted at the period end rate with exchange differences arising passing through the profit and loss account and the euro investment in Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH, which is a non-monetary item and therefore should be held at cost.
However, the Company applies fair value hedge accounting, in accordance with FRS 26, in order to hedge the long-term element of the euro loan from Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH against part of the investment in Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation on both of these items using the period end rate are taken to the profit and loss account.
The remainder of the investment in Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH is held at cost as described above.
Mitchells & Butlers 104 Annual report and accounts 2008 415 Overview 1641 Operating and financial review 4264 Reports 65110 Financial statements 111112 Shareholder information 113 Glossary Financial statements Derivative financial instruments The Company used interest rate swaps and gilt hedges during the period to mitigate the anticipated exposure to changes in interest rates and movements in the value of the Groups fixed rate debt.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Interest rate swap contracts are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which the changes arise.
Profit and loss account The Company has taken advantage of Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and not presented its own profit and loss account.
The Company recorded a profit after tax of 365m 2007 50m, less dividends of 58m 2007 538m.
Auditors remuneration for audit services to the Company was 22,000 2007 21,000.
This is borne by another Group company as are any other costs relating to non-audit services see note 5 to the Group financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements of Mitchells & Butlers plc are required to comply with the Companies Disclosure of Auditor Remuneration Regulations 2005.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results can differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used when accounting for items such as amortisation, asset impairments and pensions.
Exchange rates The results of overseas operations have been translated into sterling at weighted average rates of exchange for the year of 1 1.31 2007 1 1.48 and euro denominated assets and liabilities have been translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date of 1 1.26 2007 1 1.43.
Pensions The Company accounts for pensions under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The Company is the sponsoring employer of the Groups pension plans.
Information concerning the pension scheme arrangements operated by the Company and associated current and future contributions is contained within note 8 page 78 to the consolidated financial statements.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of the Schemes qualified actuaries.
The Companys total pension cost included within operating profit for the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2008 under FRS 17 was 15m 2007 14m, comprising 13m 2007 13m in respect of the defined benefit pension arrangements and 2m 2007 1m in respect of the defined contribution arrangements.
The valuations used for FRS 17 purposes are based on the results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2007 updated by the independent qualified actuaries to 27 September 2008.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 27 September 2008 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
As the defined benefit sections of the pension plans are now closed to new members, the current service cost as calculated under the projected unit method will increase as members approach retirement.
The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries at the balance sheet date and the basis of these are contained within note 8 page 78 to the consolidated financial statements.
The long-term rates of return on assets at 27 September 2008 shown below form the basis of the calculation of the expected return on pension scheme assets for the 2008 financial year.
The 2007 rates shown are used in calculating the 2008 expected return.

Share-based payments The expense recognised for share-based payments in the year is 1m 2007 4m which comprises share option schemes and share awards to the employees of the Company.

Derivative financial instruments In advance of the intended property backed refinancing, a number of derivative instruments were executed by or transferred to the Company, to mitigate against anticipated movements in the value of the Groups fixed rate debt.
These are explained further in note 21 page 90 to the consolidated financial statements.
These instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting within the Company as they could not be designated as a hedge against the cash flows of any specific financial instrument anticipated as part of a future property backed refinancing.
On 29 January 2008, the Group announced that following the deterioration in the mark-to-market deficit on the hedges and with no near term prospect of debt markets permitting a property-based transaction, it had closed out in cash the hedges no longer required, which included all of the derivative instruments held by the Company.
The total fair value movement of the instruments closed out, during the period to January 2008 when they were settled was a 3m gain 2007 9m loss.
This movement was recognised directly in the Companys profit and loss account.
The pre-tax cost to the Company of closing out the hedges no longer required was 6m in total.
