19 Capital review Conversion of Legal & General Pensions Limited LGPL to an Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle ISPV On 1 November 2007, LGPL was converted to an ISPV and repaid subordinated debt of 400m to Legal & General Assurance Society Society.
Societys long term fund restructure In December 2007, the Group implemented a new capital structure for Society.
A key component was the removal of the transfer formula which limited the annual amounts of distribution from Societys long term fund since 1996.
As part of the restructure, it was also announced that the 1996 Sub-fund 321m was merged into the Shareholder Retained Capital SRC.
Societys Board of Directors undertook to initially maintain 500m of assets within Society to support the withprofits business.
The amount of the commitment will reduce to 450m in 2009 and then gradually reduce to zero over a period not exceeding nine years.
In 2007 1.7bn was transferred from the SRC into the shareholder capital held outside Societys long term fund.
Financial impacts of ISPV conversion and Societys long term fund restructure The effects of the changes on the 2007 EEV results were: Long Tax ISPV term fund impact of 1 2,3 4 conversion restructure restructure Total m m m m Profit from continuing operations before tax 156 5 161 Embedded value 112 4 206 322 1.
The conversion of LGPL to an ISPV resulted in an increase in embedded value of 112m and an increase in profit before tax of 156m.
This reflects the removal of the requirement to hold a solvency margin in the ISPV and the consequent reduction in the modelled cost of solvency capital.
In Society, the SRC and 1996 Sub-fund have either been required to cover the EU solvency margin or regarded as encumbered due to the restrictions over distribution.
Following the restructure, these assets are no longer encumbered and are valued at market value less the anticipated tax charge.
The Group has previously modelled EEV operating profit assuming the SRC is released into surplus over a period of 20 years.
It is assumed that the remainder of the SRC is distributed over two years with the exception of the contingent loan balance with LGPL which is assumed to be distributed as it is repaid.
To take account of the more flexible nature of the capital in Society, the assets modelled to cover the required capital now reflect the average investment mix of the total Society Shareholder Capital which, as a result, includes a higher proportion of fixed interest investments.
The transfer from the SRC into the Society Shareholder Capital at the end of 2007 did not give rise to any incremental tax.
The tax impact on future distributions of SRC assets has been modelled using marginal tax rates of between 10% and 12%.
The combined impact for the four factors above on both contribution from new business after cost of capital and operating profit was an increase of 12m.
