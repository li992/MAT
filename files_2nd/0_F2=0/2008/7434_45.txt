Financial risk factors The Groups business exposes it to certain limited financial risks, such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk.
The Groups Treasury department is principally responsible for managing these risks using policies approved by the Board.
Liquidity risk The Group has sufficient funds and facilities available to satisfy its current requirements.
The Company has a Senior Bank Facility, consisting of a multi-currency 260.0m revolving credit facility.
During the period 80.0m of term debt was repaid earlier than scheduled and the term debt facility was cancelled.
The Group also has some locally arranged bank facilities.

From 30 March 2007 until 27 June 2007 interest on the facility was payable at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.875% plus a 0.05% utilisation fee.
From 28 June 2007 the margin was 1.75%, with the utilisation fee no longer applicable.
Of the 260.0m revolving credit facility, 35.0m 2007: 97.0m had been drawndown at 26 April 2008.
Analysis of the availability of undrawn committed facilities available to the Group is shown below.

In addition to direct drawings under the revolving credit facility in the UK, the Group has utilised the facility by drawing letters of credit to support facilities provided by local banks overseas.
Although these locally provided facilities nominally expire in less than one year, they could be renewed provided that the letter of credit drawn under the revolving credit facility is renewed.
The table above reflects the undrawn portion of these locally provided facilities as expiring in less than one year.
As at 26 April 2008, letters of credit issued totalled nil 2007: 4.5m of which nil was undrawn 2007: 4.5m.

Financial risk factors continued Security The borrowings under the Facility Agreement are secured by the Guarantors that comprise HMV Group plc and any wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company who accede to the Facility Agreement as guarantors.
As a condition of the Agreement, the aggregate gross assets, revenue and earnings before interest and tax of the Guarantors must comprise not less than 70% of the total gross assets, revenue and earnings before tax and interest of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Guarantors currently comprise HMV Group plc, HMV Music Limited, Waterstones Booksellers Limited, HMV IP Limited, HMV UK Limited, HMV Ireland Limited, Waterstones Booksellers Ireland Limited and HMV Guernsey Limited.
The Company has granted security comprising first-ranking, fixed and floating charges over all the assets and undertakings of the Guarantors.
Under their banking arrangements, overdraft and cash balances of the Company and of certain subsidiaries are pooled or offset and cross-guaranteed.
Such pooling and offset arrangements are reflected in the Group balance sheet as appropriate.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from its borrowings and cash deposits.
However, without core longer-term borrowings as is currently the position the strong seasonality to its trading patterns provides that, with the onset of peak trading in December, the Group moves into a net cash position for around three months before reverting to a net debt position until the following December.
As both debt and cash deposits attract a floating rate of interest, this seasonality provides a natural hedge against interest rate risk.
The net exposure is monitored on a regular basis, with consideration given to the supplemental use of interest rate hedging instruments.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk arises from its cash and cash equivalents, deposits, and outstanding receivables.
The Group deposits cash balances with counter parties that have a strong credit rating, with an agreed limit for each counter party, so as to limit the risk of loss arising from a failure.
Counter parties include AAA-rated liquidity funds, as well as banks.
Trade and other receivables are regularly monitored and are limited in size due to the nature of the Groups business as a retailer dealing predominantly in cash and cash equivalents.
Allowances are made for doubtful debts based on the age of the debt and the customers financial circumstances.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the foreign exchange risk of imports where volumes are significant.
However, the Groups operating businesses generally source the majority of their products from suppliers within their country of operation and so the foreign exchange exposure is limited.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
Details of foreign currency contracts outstanding at the balance sheet date are given in Note 26.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency translation risk through its investment in overseas subsidiaries, which is partially hedged by local debt.
Generally, the Group does not hedge any net translation exposure of overseas earnings, although it may in certain circumstances implement hedges to secure short-term financial objectives.
Sensitivity analysis The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the sensitivity to changes in market variables of the Groups and Companys financial instruments and show the impact on profit and shareholders equity.
Interest rate sensitivity Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end, a 100 basis points movement in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax and shareholders funds by approximately 0.2m 2007: 1.5m.
The impact on the Company would have been 1.2m 2007: 1.8m.

Financial risk factors continued Foreign exchange rate sensitivity The Group maintains stores in Canada, Europe and Asia.
Based on the performance of the overseas businesses in the year to April 2008, a 10% change in the value of local currencies against Sterling would affect the Groups profit before tax by 1.6m 2007: 2.0m and the Groups equity by 4.1m 2007: 3.0m.
There would not have been any impact on the Company.
