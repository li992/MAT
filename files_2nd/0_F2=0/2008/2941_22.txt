In the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests are performed based on internal valuations of each cash generating unit.
Management consider Support services, Construction services, Public Private Partnership Projects and Head Office as distinct reporting segments.
Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable cash generating units CGUs, detailed above, within the Construction services and Support services reporting segments.
Our CGUs have been identified within our reporting segments as those businesses that generate cash inflows largely independently of other businesses within the Group, and which are subject to independent management.
Section 05 Financial statements 85 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 13.
Intangible assets continued Following the re-organisation of Carillion in December 2007 and the Alfred McAlpine acquisition in February 2008 a number of our businesses were consolidated and, as a result, the CGUs previously reported in our 2007 financial statements have been reclassified to align to our new structure.
The restructuring allowed a clear mapping of the previously reported CGUs to the new CGUs based upon managerial responsibility.
The main effects of these changes were to consolidate Regional and National Building, now fully integrated as our Building CGU, Regional Civils was mapped to our infrastructure CGU, with rail and rail projects being consolidated into our new infrastructure services CGU and all facilities businesses including Citex and Planned Maintenance into our Business services CGU.
The Carillion and Alfred McAlpine businesses are an excellent strategic fit and combining them has created the UKs largest support services business, with enhanced positions in our chosen market sectors.
The acquisition of Alfred McAlpine was a strategic decision which enabled the Group to significantly enhance our support services capabilities and to generate substantial cost savings in business services and therefore the entire goodwill arising on this acquisition has been allocated to the Business services CGU.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in revenue and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions have been reviewed in the light of the current economic environment which has resulted in more conservative estimates about the future.
The impact of the current global economic downturn on the financial stability of our customers, partners and suppliers will be mitigated by continuing to apply rigorous selectivity criteria in relation to their financial stability, the security of project funding and contractual terms and conditions.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
Whilst the Group has five CGUs, the risks and rewards associated with Construction services are consistent, and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
Similarly the risks and rewards encountered in the Support services CGUs are consistent so one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
In determining the discount rate, management have sought to arrive at a pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt.
In calculating the cost of equity a range of market risk premiums were used with a Beta value of 0.9.
A market premium of 9.0 per cent was used to calculate a pre-tax discount rate of 13.0 per cent for the CGUs in the Construction services segment.
A market premium of 5.1 per cent was used to calculate a pre-tax discount rate of 9.0 per cent for the CGUs in the Support services segment.
The annual growth rates are based on internal assessments with no growth anticipated for the Construction services segment and the Infrastructure services CGU and growth expected in the Business services CGU segment at 5.0 per cent for the next five years, 2.5 per cent growth for years six to ten which reflects expected changes in Retail Price Index and no growth thereafter.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent annual financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates cash flows based upon the growth rates indicated above.
The impairment tests at 31 December 2008 show that for the Business services CGU the number of years required to recover the carrying value was 15 years and in all other CGUs this is less than seven years.
Management consider that these pay back periods are not excessive given the long-term strategic benefit of all the acquisitions and in particular the acquisitions of Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine.
As at 31 December 2008, based on internal valuations, Carillion plc management concluded that the recoverable value of the cash generating units tested exceeded their carrying amount.
Amortisation charge The amortisation charge of 44.2 million 2007: 20.6 million is recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amortisation of the intangible assets of 119.0 million arising on the acquisition of Mowlem will be 79 per cent complete by 2016.
The remaining amortisation charge will be incurred over the following 25 years.
Amortisation of the intangible assets of 125.4 million arising on the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine will be 84 per cent complete by 2013 with the remaining amortisation charge continuing until 2019.

The translation reserve also includes any related current taxation.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, together with any related deferred taxation.
Fair value reserve The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is derecognised, together with any related deferred taxation.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose on the demerger from Tarmac plc on 29 July 1999.
The reserve increased on acquisition of Mowlem on 23 February 2006 and Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008 whereby the consideration included the issue of Carillion plc shares.
The Group has opted to credit the merger reserve rather than the share premium account as permitted by the Companies Act 1985.
The 42.1 million transfer to the retained earnings reserve during the year represents the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on the Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine acquisitions.
Retained earnings Retained earnings include the reserve for the Companys own shares which comprises of the cost of the Companys shares held by the Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP.
The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to employees under the Groups share incentive schemes.
The movements in the reserve for own shares included within retained earnings are as follows: 2008 2007 m m At 1 January 0.7 1.6 Share options exercised by employees exercise price 0.9 Share options exercised transfer to retained earnings 4.1 Acquisition of own shares 4.7 At 31 December 1.3 0.7 At 31 December 2008, the ESOP held 419,827 2007: 61,909 of the Companys shares.
During the year the Company acquired 1,257,104 of its own shares for 4.7 million to meet the plans future commitments.
The ESOP has elected to waive all dividends except for a total payment of one pence at the time each dividend is paid.
In addition to the ESOP, the Company has also established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust Quest.
During the year, 210,859 2007: 2,643 ordinary shares in the Company held by the QUEST were transferred to employees of the Group following the exercise of options under the Sharesave Scheme.
At 31 December 2008 the total number of shares held under the QUEST amounted to 8,904 2007: 219,763 and had a market value of 22,100 2007: 0.8 million.

Share-based payments The Group has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to purchase shares in the entity.
Details of the current option schemes can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 55 to 57.

The total number of options outstanding at 31 December 2008 for these schemes amounted to 1,010,733 2007: 1,010,733 with a remaining contractual life of either two or three years.
Following the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008, 650,671 Carillion Sharesave options were granted to participating employees of the Alfred McAlpine Sharesave scheme.
In the period since acquisition 303,849 share options were exercised and 17,909 share options were forfeited in respect of this scheme.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise during the year was 356.3 pence.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions: 2008 2007 2006 2006 LEAP LEAP Sharesave LEAP Fair value of share options and assumptions Fair value at grant date 358.5p 392.0p 102.0p 295.0p Share price at grant date 383.8p 421.0p 385.0p 319.0p Exercise price 337.5p Expected volatility 16.01% 21.97% 27.44% 28.55% Option life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 2.27% 2.34% 2.45% 2.58% Risk-free interest rate based on national government bonds 3.96% 5.35% 5.0% 4.8% The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.

Guarantees and contingent liabilities continued Carillion JM Limited CJM formerly Mowlem has been the subject of the Office of Fair Tradings OFT on-going investigation of cover pricing in the construction industry under The Competition Act 1988.
The investigation relates to CJMs construction business and relates entirely to periods prior to CJMs acquisition.
No other member of the Group has been subject to the investigation.
CJM has co-operated fully with the OFT.
Any fine ultimately arising would be subject to the statutory maximum financial penalty of 10 per cent of world-wide revenue of the undertaking concerned in the business year prior to the infringement.
Group management believes that it is extremely unlikely that any fine imposed will approach this amount.
Group management also does not believe that customers have suffered any loss or damage as a result of any actions taken by CJM.
Guarantees and counter indemnities have been given to financial institutions in respect of the provision of performance and other contract related bonds that are issued in the normal course of business.
Claims under contracts and other agreements, including joint arrangements, are outstanding in the normal course of business.
The Group, in the normal course of its construction activities, is the subject of certain legal proceedings.
The resolution of these proceedings is regarded as unlikely to succeed or to have a material effect on the Groups financial position.
Financial instruments Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily the Middle East, Canada and the Caribbean.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 10 million equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, to at least 60 per cent of the net asset value.
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved through borrowing denominated in the relevant foreign currencies or where this is not practicable in a currency which the relevant currency closely follows.
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of the hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
Primarily the Group has relatively small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
Any individual exposures that are significant are hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques.
Each movement of five per cent in exchange rates against sterling would have changed reported profit before tax and equity as follows: 5% increase 5% decrease Profit Equity Profit Equity m m m m United States of America Dollar 1.6 1.8 Canadian Dollar 1.2 2.7 1.3 2.9 Euro 3.7 3.1 4.0 3.4 United Arab Emirates Dirham 1.7 2.3 1.8 2.5 Danish Krona 1.4 1.4 1.6 1.6 Other 0.1 0.1 Foreign currency exposure The carrying amount of the Groups borrowing denominated in foreign currency is as follows: 2008 2007 m m United States of America Dollar 17.6 12.6 Canadian Dollar 82.2 57.9 United Arab Emirates Dirham 8.5 Other 1.5 0.1 109.8 70.6 Of the total foreign currency borrowing of 109.8 million 2007: 70.6 million, the amount of borrowing used for hedging overseas currency net assets amounts to 62.6 million 2007: 32.6 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 8.9 million 2007: loss of 2.7 million on translation of the borrowing into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve.

Such borrowing is subject to floating rates of interest linked to London Interbank Offered Rate.
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the Groups subsidiaries.
However, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
A one percentage point rise in interest rates in respect of US dollar borrowing would increase the annual net interest charge by approximately 0.3 million, in respect of Canadian dollar borrowing an increase of 0.4 million, in respect of United Arab Emirates Dirham denominated borrowing an increase of 0.1 million, and in respect of sterling borrowing an increase of 3.3 million.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of a syndicated loan and short term overdraft facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
The average net borrowing during 2008 in the period since the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine was 329.8 million 2007: 130.3 million.

Financial instruments continued Borrowing facilities The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at the year end in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met: 2008 2007 m m Expiring within one year 6.5 Expiring between two and five years 235.8 283.4 242.3 283.4 Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at main Board level or within predetermined limits.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
The movement in the provision is as follows: 2008 2007 m m At 1 January 13.4 11.3 Provision acquired 1.2 Provision created 3.4 4.9 Provision utilised 0.4 1.7 Provision released 0.8 1.1 At 31 December 16.8 13.4 There are 72.9 million 2007: 26.2 million of trade receivables that are past due at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against, which are all more than six months overdue.
In the current global economic climate, whilst uncertainty surrounding counterparty risk has increased, on balance the Group believes that debtors will meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables and amounts owed by customers on contracts recognised in the balance sheet that are past due and unprovided as at 31 December 2008.
Overall, subject to the global economic climate, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments 2008 2007 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Forward foreign currency contracts 1.1 0.7 The movement in fair value of the above forward foreign currency contracts has been recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement.
In addition to the above, a number of the Group's Public Private Partnership PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP jointly controlled entities are without recourse to the Group.
The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and hedge future movements across a range spanning up until September 2035.
At 31 December 2008 the Group's share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to 43.7 million 2007: 34.5 million of which 26.1 million 2007: 23.0 million and the related deferred tax asset of 7.3 million 2007: 6.9 million has been recognised in the hedging reserve.

Capital risk management The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure.

The same assumptions have been used for local medical and dental inflation rates in relation to the Post Retirement Benefit Plan.
The immediate trend rate is 10 per cent per annum with an ultimate trend rate of five per cent per annum 2013.
An increase of one per cent in the valuation trend would increase liabilities by 0.5 million and the total service cost by 0.1 million.
A decrease of one per cent in the valuation trend would reduce liabilities by 0.4 million and total service cost by 0.1 million.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined by reference to local long term interest rates, the yield on gilts or Treasury stock and the actuarys recommendation on the allowance for the potential long term extra return from investing in equities.
Carillion has adopted immediate recognition of any actuarial gains or losses through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense as permitted under IAS 19.

The Group is unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS of 85.2 million and taken directly to total equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Therefore, the Group is unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 1 January 2004.

Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: Construction contracts In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in relation to final out turn on each contract.
On major construction contracts, it is assessed, based on past experience, that their outcome cannot be estimated reliably during the early stages of the contract, but that costs incurred will be recoverable.
Once the outcome can be estimated reliably the estimates of final out turn on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account of the specific risks within each contract that have been identified during the early stages of the contract.
The cost contingencies are reviewed on a regular basis throughout the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate.
However, the nature of the risks on contracts are such that they often cannot be resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the project.
Management continually reviews the estimated final out turn on contracts and makes adjustments where necessary.
Intangible assets In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in relation to final out turn on construction contracts, discount rates and expected future cash flows and profitability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached.
Note 13 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made.
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group: expected return on plan assets inflation rate mortality discount rate salary and pensions increases.
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 33.
