During 2007 the schemes in Canada, Ireland and Hong Kong were recognised on the Group balance sheet for the first time.

The assets of the scheme are held in a trustee administered fund separate from the Company.
With effect from 1st December 2006 the Scheme was amended to eliminate future benefit accruals.
Under the Scheme as amended, a participant's normal retirement benefit will be determined based on their service and compensation prior to 1st December 2006.
The average compensation and length of service will be determined as at 1st December 2006.
The amendment to the plan gave rise to a curtailment gain of 31,300,000 which was treated as an exceptional item in 2006.
The Company agreed to make additional contributions to the scheme totalling 65m.
An initial amount of 14 million was paid in December 2006 and a further amount of 31 million was paid in January 2007, 10 million was paid in January 2008 with the balance of 10 million payable no later than December 2009.
The last formal valuation of the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pension Scheme was undertaken at 1st April, 2006.
This was updated to 31st December, 2008 by a qualified actuary employed by the Group.
