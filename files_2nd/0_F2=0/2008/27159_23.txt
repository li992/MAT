Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2008 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation and going concern The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued January 2003 and revised in December 2005.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Directors believe this is appropriate for the reasons outlined in the Directors Report on page 26.
During the year the Company adopted FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
This standard primarily concerns the disclosure of financial instruments and risks.
These disclosures can be found primarily in note 17. b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares other than special dividends are treated as revenue for the year on an exdividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to the circumstances.
The fixed returns on debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
All expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except as follows: transaction costs on the acquisition or disposal of investments are recognised as a capital item in the Income Statement.
expenses are charged to realised capital reserves where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 50% to revenue and 50% to realised capital reserves to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital reserves and the revenue account on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Companys effective rate of tax for the year.
42 Murray Income Trust PLC Enfocus Software - Customer Support e Valuation of Investments Investments have been designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS London Stock Exchanges electronic trading service stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the net return for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the unrealised capital reserve.
f Borrowings Monies borrowed to finance the investment objectives of the Company are stated at the amount of net proceeds immediately after issue plus cumulative finance costs less cumulative payments made in respect of the debt.
The finance costs of such borrowings are allocated to years over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount and are charged 50% to revenue and 50% to realised capital reserves to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Companys financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, liquid resources, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, futures and options, subject to Board approval, for the purpose of managing currency and market risk arising from the Companys activities.
During the year the Company entered into one yield-enhanced security, details of which are provided in the Portfolio of Investments table on page 15.
The main risks the Company faces from these financial instruments are i market price risk comprising interest rate and other price risk, ii liquidity risk and iii credit risk.
In line with the Companys investment objective, the portfolio comprises UK securities and therefore has no exposure to foreign currency risk.
In order to mitigate risk, the investment strategy is to select investments for their fundamental value.
Stock selection is therefore based on disciplined accounting, market and sector analysis.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
The Attribution Analysis, detailing the allocation of assets and the stock selection, is shown on pages 6 and 7.
The Investment Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Current strategy is detailed in the Chairmans Statement on pages 4 and 5 and in the Investment Managers Review on pages 6 to 8.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks.
The Board has agreed the level of gearing, which was 10.0% of net assets as at 30 June 2008 2007 5.7%.
The Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the current and previous year.
The numerical disclosures in the table listed below exclude short-term debtors and creditors.
Market price risk The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations, which are monitored by the Manager in pursuance of the investment objective as set out on page 2.
Adherence to investment guidelines and to investment and borrowing powers set out in the management agreement mitigates the risk of exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in the Investment Managers Review on pages 6 to 8.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions as a consequence of price movements.
It is the Boards policy to hold equity investments in the portfolio in a broad spread of sectors in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
A summary of investment changes during the year under review is on page 16 and an analysis of the equity portfolio by industrial classification is on pages 14 and 15.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings.
48 Murray Income Trust PLC Enfocus Software - Customer Support The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and borrowing decisions.
Financial assets The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
The interest rate risk of the portfolio of financial assets at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Floating rate Fixed rate Non-interest bearing 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 6,390 2,073 5,272 15,666 428,553 527,603 The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The interest bearing assets represent the equity linked notes, amounting to 5,272,000 2007 15,666,000.
Their weighted average interest rate, based on current yield of the underlying equity, plus a fixed rate of interest on the nominal amount notes held, being 11.24% 2007 9.55%.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the equity and Put options elements of the portfolio.
Financial liabilities The Company has borrowings by way of a loan facility, details of which are in note 12.
The fair value of the loan equates to the cost as the loans are rolled on a monthly basis.
All other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the Balance Sheet at fair value.
Maturity profile The maturity profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 30 June was as follows: Within Within 1 year 1 year 2008 2007 Assets 000 000 Fixed rate Equity linked notes 5,272 15,666 Floating rate Cash 6,390 2,073 Between Between 1 and 2 1 and 2 years years 2008 2007 Liabilities 000 000 Floating rate Revolving bank credit facility 40,000 30,000 Murray Income Trust PLC 49 Enfocus Software - Customer Support All the other financial assets and liabilities do not have a maturity date.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and nonderivative instruments at the Balance Sheet date and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant in the case of instruments that have floating rates.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Companys : profit before tax for the year ended 30 June 2008 would increase decrease by 64,000 2007 increase decrease by 21,000.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its floating rate cash balances.
equity reserves would not be materially affected as the fixed interest holdings held are linked to an underlying equity, and therefore covered under the other price risk section.
Other price risk Other price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted investments.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and the stock selection process, as detailed on page 2, both act to reduce market risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
Other price risk sensitivity If market prices at the Balance Sheet date had been 10% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant, the return attributable to Ordinary Shareholders and equity for the year ended 30 June 2008 would have increased decreased by 43,382,000 2007 54,327,000.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of committed loan and overdraft facilities.
As at 30 June 2008 the Company utilised 40,000,000 of a 75,000,000 revolving bank credit facility.
The facility expires on 1 October 2009 by which time all advances must be paid.
The aggregate of all future interest payments at the rate ruling at 30 June 2008 and the redemption of the loan amounts to 42,806,000. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.
This is mitigated by the Investment Manager reviewing the credit ratings of broker counterparties.
The risk attached to dividend flows is mitigated by the Investment Managers research of potential investee companies.
The Companys custodian bank is responsible for the collection of income on behalf of the Company and their performance is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
Capital management policies and procedures The investment objective of the Company is to achieve a high and growing income combined with capital growth through investment in a portfolio of UK equities.
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to Shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
50 Murray Income Trust PLC Enfocus Software - Customer Support The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing which takes into account the Investment Managers views on the market: the level of equity shares in issue: the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
At the year end financial covenants contained within the loan agreements provide, inter alia, that borrowings shall at no time exceed 45% of net assets and that the net assets must exceed 225 million.
At 30 June 2008 net gearing was 10% and the net assets were 400.5 million.
Contingent assets On 5 November 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that management fees on investment trusts should be exempt from VAT.
HMRC has announced its intention not to appeal against this ruling to the UK VAT Tribunal and therefore protective claims which have been made in relation to the Company will be processed in due course.
It is likely that a repayment will be made by HMRC in respect of VAT which has been charged on investment management fees in past years and the Board is currently quantifying the potential repayment that should be due.
The amount the Company will receive, the period to which it will refer, and the timescale for receipt are at present uncertain and the Company has taken no account in the financial statements of any such repayments.
The Company has not been charged VAT on its investment management fees since September 2007.
