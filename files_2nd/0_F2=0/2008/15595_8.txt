Our Operating Model used to be called Tesco in a Box because as we have grown and our international markets needed to build capability, they could basically put their hand into the box and pick the systems they needed rather than having to develop their own.

Its this flexibility and building the business and developing our offer.
In the last year we have diversity of store formats that helps us grow and reach new customers.
Building on the success of our hypermarkets we For example, four years ago we were mainly opening new hypermarkets have developed a new 3K format for smaller cities and this year opened in Central Europe.
Now we have several formats, from our new 25 Express stores in inner city locations.

In fact, China is such a big place, that need to be open at any time.

We have worked hard to find the right locations for our stores, often parcelling together pieces of land on brownfield sites, helped by our proactive, flexible, innovative, risk-embracing approach.
The type of sites we invest in has changed over the years as customers needs have changed and, in some of our markets, as new planning policies have been introduced.
For example, the majority of our new stores in the UK are built on town-centre or edge-of-town brownfield sites, working with the grain of planning legislation, which seeks to direct investment back into town centres.
In addition, more of our new space is now for Express convenience stores as customers shop more regularly and closer to their homes.
We have well-established site research and property acquisition teams who spend a lot of time on the ground looking at potential sites, reviewing current retail provision and establishing how local needs might change.
These teams dont work in isolation they regularly review sites, often our environmental impact, not just for new builds, but also for existing working with town planners and our local store directors in order to stores.
