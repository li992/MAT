Fidessa group plc 44 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Fidessa group plc Fidessa or the Company, is a company incorporated in England and Wales.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 13th February 2009.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its group.
Both the Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
In publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption in s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
1 Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of financial instruments which are stated in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions and IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on Defined Benefit Assets, Minimum Funding Requirements and Their Interaction have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements.
None of these interpretations had any impact on the Groups result or financial position.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results for which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates, assumptions and judgements that are likely to contain the greatest degree of uncertainty are summarised in note 25.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently by the Group and Company to all periods presented in these financial statements.
2 Significant accounting policies a Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Fidessa group plc and its subsidiaries.
There are no associates or joint ventures to be included in the consolidated accounts.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain the benefits from its activities, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group until the date on which control ceases.
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
b Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchanges rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 45 ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at rates approximating the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in the translation reserve.
Exchange gains and losses arising on the translation of the Groups net investment in foreign entities are recognised in the translation reserve.
On disposal of a foreign entity the cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement and recognised as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
c Revenue Revenue represents the amount chargeable, excluding sales related taxes, for software related services supplied.
Revenue is only recognised where there is persuasive evidence that a contract exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable.
Full allowance is made for all known or expected losses.
Revenue from rental, application hosting and support services is recognised equally over the period that the service is to be provided.
Revenue from installation, consultancy and training services chargeable on a time and materials basis is recognised when the work is performed.
Revenue from fixed price implementations and perpetual software licences is recognised over the period of implementation in accordance with the estimated percentage completed for each contract.
Deferred revenue represents amounts invoiced to customers for goods and services not yet supplied.
Accrued revenue represents amounts recognised as revenue to be invoiced in a future period.
d Share-based payments The Group operates equity-settled share incentive plans.
No expense is recognised in respect of share incentives granted before 7th November 2002 or incentives vested before 1st January 2005.
For share incentives granted after 7th November 2002 and vested after 1st January 2005 the fair value of the incentives granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the incentives.
The fair value of the incentives granted is measured using a binomial model or a Monte Carlo simulation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the incentives were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share incentives that vest except where forfeiture is only due to the share price not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiaries financial statements, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
e Post employment benefits Certain subsidiaries operate defined contribution pension schemes for their employees.
Pension costs are charged to the income statement as they arise.
f Interest receivable Interest receivable on interest-bearing financial assets is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate used reflects the anticipated cash flows to be received.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, where the effective interest rate has been and is still assessed as being zero, both capital and interest amounts received are recognised as income on receipt.
g Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Fidessa group plc 46 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
h Segment reporting A business segment is a distinguishable component of a group engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The Group considers there to be only one business segment.
A geographic segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided by the Group to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Equipment and furniture 3-5 years Computers 2-3 years Motor vehicles 4 years Buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements 5-10 years or remainder of lease if shorter j Intangible assets Research and development Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs incurred on product development relating to the design, programming and testing of new or enhanced products are capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that the development will provide economic benefits, considering its commercial and technological feasibility, resources are available for the development, and costs can be measured reliably.
The expenditure capitalised is the direct labour cost and is managed and controlled centrally.
Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Product development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Capitalised product development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Product development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the time of development on a straight-line basis over three years.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups interest in the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 47 Acquisition intangibles Intangible assets acquired from a business combination are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition and amortised over their estimated useful economic life.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets are as follows: Customer relationships 10 years Complete technology 5 years Brands and other marketing related 8 years Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are purchased by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Software purchased for internal use is amortised over two years.
k Impairment of assets Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates is estimated and the carrying amount is tested annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of assets other than goodwill and deferred tax are reviewed for impairment only when events indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
In an impairment test, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit or asset is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use for the Group.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.
In determining a cash generating units or assets value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the cash generating unit or asset that have not already been included in the estimate of future cash flows.
l Leased assets Where the Group enters into an operating lease the rentals are charged as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
m Investments and financial instruments A financial instrument is recognised if the Company or Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised if the Groups contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if the Group transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset.
Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Groups obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.
i Available for sale financial assets The Groups investments in equity securities and certain debt securities are classified as available for sale financial assets.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on available for sale monetary items, are recognised directly in equity.
When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
If an equity instrument cannot be reliably measured, then it is carried at amortised cost.
Fidessa group plc 48 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued ii Other Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
n Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at amortised cost, their carrying value being reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
o Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
p Trade payables Trade payables are stated at amortised cost.
q Employee Benefit Trust and Share Bonus Trust The Employee Benefit Trust and Share Bonus Trust, which purchase and hold ordinary shares of the Company in connection with employee share schemes, are included in the Companys financial statements.
Any consideration paid or received by the trusts for the purchase or sale of the Companys own shares is shown as a movement in shareholders equity.
r Provisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material the provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.
No provision is recognised for contingent liabilities if it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle an obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
3 Recent accounting developments The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements: Amendments to IFRS2 Share-based Payments Vesting Conditions and Cancellations is applicable from 2009 and affects SAYE and hold-share schemes.
It is not expected to have any impact on the company or consolidated financial statements.
IFRS8 Operating Segments is applicable for the Groups 2009 financial statements.
It contains requirements for disclosure about an entitys operating segments, products and services, geographical areas in which it operates and major customers.
The standard is concerned only with disclosure and replaces IAS14 Segment Reporting.
The group is currently assessing the impact this standard would have on the presentation of its consolidated results.
IAS23 Borrowing Costs Revised is applicable for the Groups 2009 financial statements.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes is applicable for the Groups 2009 financial statements and is not expected to have any impact on the company or consolidated financial statements.
4 Segment reporting The Group operates in one business segment: that of supply of software to financial institutions.
The operations are monitored by the geographic regions of Europe, North America and Asia.
Certain activities and costs are managed and monitored centrally.
Tax assets and liabilities, intangible assets resulting from acquisitions and the intangible asset for product development capitalised are excluded from segment assets and liabilities.
The segment information in respect of the regions is presented below.

Patent dispute settlement In June 2003 Fidessa noted an announcement released by Lava Trading Inc. now part of Citigroup that it had filed a patent infringement claim in the US against Fidessa.
The patent relates to the concept of displaying prices from more than one source ECN on a single screen in the US.
In December 2003 Lava filed an amendment to its lawsuit alleging unfair trade practices on the part of Fidessa, in particular in relation to the pricing of products and associated services.
In December 2004 Fidessa announced that a Stipulated Judgment had been entered into the record in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which formally recorded that the patent had not been infringed.
Lava lodged an appeal and in April 2006 the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit determined that the lower court did not correctly interpret all the technical terms in the patent and referred the case back to the lower court.
This meant that the patent proceedings, started in June 2003, were for the most part restarted from the beginning and all previous judgments no longer stood.
Both parties were therefore expecting further significant expenditure on litigation in order to progress the case.
On 30th July 2008 Fidessa announced that a settlement agreement had been reached with Lava under which Fidessa will provide Lava with products and services valued at $1.95 million over the next three years.
In return Lava will license Fidessa to use the inventions covered by the patent.
Both firms agree to drop all claims and counter claims relating to this dispute.
The $1.95 million settlement has been charged to the income statement in 2008.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 51 The dispute had previously been treated as a contingent liability since due to the then uncertainty of the eventual outcome of the case, no provision was made in accordance with the requirements of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Lehman receivable write off On 15th September 2008 Lehman Brothers International Europe appointed Administrators in the UK and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc filed petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the US.
On 16th September 2008 Lehman Brothers Japan Inc commenced civil rehabilitation procedures under the Japan Civil Rehabilitation Law.
These entities together with certain of their subsidiaries together Lehman accounted for circa 2.0 million of revenue per annum and were a top ten customer.
The receivables from Lehman at these dates are unlikely to be recoverable and a 626,000 write off resulted.
6 Auditor fees The following table shows an analysis of fees payable to the Groups auditors 2008 2007 000 000 Fees payable for the audit of these financial statements 36 33 Fees payable for audits of subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 140 167 Fees payable for reviews of subsidiaries 62 49 Services relating to taxation 82 150 Services relating to corporate finance transactions 160 Total fees paid to the auditor 320 559 The 2007 assignment relating to corporate finance activities was awarded after a competitive tender process against other major providers.

The diluted earnings per share have been calculated using an average share price of 765p 2007 1037p for the year.

Management consider that earnings per share after these adjustments provide a better year to year comparison of performance.
At 1st January 2007 and 2008 they were held at cost of 219,000 and cumulative depreciation of 219,000.
12 Goodwill 000 Carrying value at 1st January 2007 Acquisition of LatentZero 47,129 Carrying value at 1st January 2008 47,129 Adjustment to deferred considerations 2,232 Carrying value at 31st December 2008 44,897 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash generating units.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of cash generating units.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, future growth rate of the revenue, operating margin and net operating cash flows.
These reflect recent past experience following the ownership by the Group.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of LatentZero results from the value of the assembled workforce, the synergistic nature of the acquisition due to cross-selling opportunities between the buy-side and sell-side clients, potential cost savings, the expected future growth and the acceleration of the Groups operations into the buy-side.
The LatentZero acquisition goodwill has been assigned to the buy-side cash generating unit.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the latest approved forecasts for the following year which have been extended for the following four years based on an average estimated growth rate of 15% which management consider reflects a reasonable future rate for the business after considering the increasing amount of recurring revenue, assessing the market opportunities and potential to expand the addressable market.
A declining rate of cash flow growth to 5% and a terminal growth of 2% has been assumed after the five year period as the expected useful life is greater than five years.
This reflects a cautious long-term average growth rate for the products and services.
Future cash flows are discounted in line with the appropriate weighted average cost of capital for the buy-side business of 10% pre-tax 2007: 12%.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 55 This has been calculated after assessing the risk premium, the capital structure and the businesss beta factor.
The reduction in the discount rate reflects the move in the year from requiring a loan facility for working capital contingency to not requiring any facility, the expectation that the Group and the buy-side business will have substantial positive cash resources into the future, the increased integration of the buy-side business into the rest of the Groups operations, the increasing level of recurring revenue in the buy-side business and the reduction in the risk free rate of return.

The business subsequently changed its name to Touchpaper Group Limited Touchpaper.
Following the divestment, the Company held financial assets in Touchpaper comprising preference shares, ordinary shares, warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares and loan notes.
Since July 2001 the Company has had no financial influence or operational involvement in the Touchpaper business and their results have not been consolidated into Fidessas performance.
In the year to 31st December 2007 Touchpaper had reported revenue of 17.5 million, profit before tax of 0.4 million and gross assets of 9.4 million under UK GAAP.
Preference shares Fidessa held 17,000,000 redeemable preferences shares of 100p which were redeemable at par on 31st January 2011 or later if mutually agreed, the redemption date previously being deferred from 31st January 2008 or in the event of an earlier sale, for 25% of the sales proceeds of the Touchpaper business, to a maximum of 17,000,000.
The redeemable preference shares carried a cumulative coupon at an annual rate of 0.5%.
The redeemable preference shares gave Fidessa no voting rights.
These were classed as loans and receivables and held at amortised cost of nil being the fair value on initial recognition, and the directors assessed the effective interest rate as being zero.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 57 Ordinary shares and warrants Fidessa held 19% of the ordinary share capital of Touchpaper with the same voting rights as the other ordinary shareholders.
In addition, Fidessa held warrants over 1,275,000 ordinary shares in Touchpaper.
The warrants over ordinary shares represented up to a maximum of 51% of the diluted equity of Touchpaper when exercised.
The warrants were exercisable only on the sale or listing of Touchpaper.
Both ordinary shares and warrants in Touchpaper were classed as available for sale assets but were measured at cost of nil being their fair value on initial recognition because their fair value could not be measured reliably.
The range of reasonable fair value estimates was significant and the probabilities of the various estimates could not be reasonably assessed due to the lack of financial information and the inherent uncertainty as to cash flows, therefore Fidessa was precluded from measuring the instruments at fair value.
A loan note Fidessa held a 897,755 variable rate secured loan note.
The loan note was scheduled to be repaid in three instalments between 31st July 2009 and 31st July 2011.
Interest was payable in arrears at a rate of 4% per annum above base lending rates as set by Barclays Bank plc.
The loan note and interest were secured over certain assets of Touchpaper.
The loan note had been classified as loan and receivables and was carried at amortised cost of 897,755 being also their fair value on initial recognition.
B loan note Fidessa held a 3,802,000 variable rate unsecured loan note.
The loan note was repayable in annual instalments of 500,000 commencing in July 2002.
The loan note had been classified as loan and receivables and was carried at amortised cost of nil being the fair value attributed on initial recognition on divestment of Touchpaper.
The effective interest rate was assessed as being zero.
As at 31 December 2007 the outstanding capital was 1,002,000.
In 2007 300,000 of the loan note was repaid and 70,000 of interest on the loan was received.
Sale to Avocent On 30th June 2008 Avocent Ireland Holdings Limited Avocent acquired the entire share capital of Touchpaper and the preference shares and loan notes were redeemed.
The Company has recorded a gain in the year of 10,687,000 for the sale and redemption of the ordinary and preference shares, 1,900,000 for the redemption of the loan notes and 488,000 for the accrued interest on the loan notes.
The consideration comprises payment at completion of 12,525,000 plus amounts held in escrow in respect of working capital conditions being met at completion and against indemnities and general warranties of 550,000.
Discussions continue between the relevant parties for the release of the escrow monies relating to working capital at completion and the indemnities and general warranties money is not due for release until July 2010.
The maximum that Fidessa could receive from these escrows is 478,000 and 3,404,000 respectively of which 550,000 is recognised in these accounts, classified at fair value through profit and loss having taken account of the believed risks and exposures.
At 31st December 2008 Fidessa no longer held any investment in Touchpaper.

All shares rank equally with regard to the Companys residual assets.
Cumulative translation adjustment The cumulative translation adjustment comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.
Merger reserve The merger reserve represents the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of shares issued by the Company to acquire at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company.
A purchaser company acquiring at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company under an arrangement, which provides for the allotment of equity shares by the purchaser in return for the equity interest in the acquiree, must apply Section 131 of the Companies Act.
When applicable, the section requires that the premium on the issue of equity shares by the purchaser company be disregarded.
Accordingly, the Company did not record a premium on the shares it issued but recognised a merger reserve in the consolidated balance sheet.
Dividends paid and proposed On 2nd June 2008 the 2007 final dividend of 12.0 pence per share, 4,149,000, 2007: final dividend for 2006 of 8.8 pence per share, 2,993,000 was paid.
On 29th September 2008 the 2008 interim dividend of 7.5 pence per share, 2,602,000, 2007: 6.0 pence per share, 2,045,000 was paid.
The directors propose a final dividend for 2008 of 17.0 pence per share, 5,893,000, payable on 8th June 2009 to shareholders on the register on 8th May 2009, with an ex-dividend date of 6th May 2009.
The dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.

All share incentives are over ordinary shares of the Company.
The Company grants share incentives to employees in the form of share options, share bonuses and under the Exceptional Growth Rate Incentive Plan.
The fair value of all incentives granted since 7th November 2002 and not vested at 1st January 2005 is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The employee expense is recognised equally over the time from grant until vesting of the incentive.
For share options and share bonuses the fair value has been measured using a binomial model.
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility.
The material inputs into the model have been: Granted in Granted in Granted in Granted in Share options 2004 2005 2006 2007 Fair value 166.9p 108.5p 190p 267p Share price at grant 560p 632p 860p 949p Exercise price 560p 632p 860p 949p Expected volatility 35% 20% 25% 30% Expected life 6 years 6 years 5 years 5 years Expected dividends 3.2% 3.4% 2.9% 2.2% Risk-free rate of return 4.6% 4.1% 4.7% 5.0% Share bonuses Awards in 2005 Awards in 2007 Awards in 2008 Fair value 585.6p to 658.5p 775p to 1116p 456p to 672p Share price at purchase 649.2p to 730.0p 829p to 1193p 482p to 710p Expected volatility 20% 30% 30% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividends 3.4% 2.2% 1.8% The fair value of the award under the Exceptional Growth Rate Incentive Plan EGRIP has been measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008 63 21 Business combination There were no acquisitions in the period.
In the year ended 31st December 2007 the Group acquired LatentZero Limited, the details of which are set out below.
On 27th April 2007 the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of LatentZero Limited for a total consideration of up to 62.3 million including 1.5 million of related costs and net of 1.6 million of discounting of the contingent consideration.
Consideration of 37.4 million was paid on completion and further contingent consideration of up to 25.0 million was to be paid dependent on the achievement of performance objectives related to revenue, operating profit and order intake in 2007 and 2008.
In the period, the contingent consideration in respect of the 2007 performance has been settled in full.
In addition, the value of the contingent consideration in respect of the 2008 performance has been agreed at a fixed discounted value of 6,590,000 cash and 362,000 shares.
This will be settled in March 2009 and has been included in current liabilities classified as fair value through profit and loss.
There have been no changes to the fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities acquired from those presented in the 2007 financial statements.
The agreement to fix the value of the 2008 contingent consideration adjusts the consideration and the notional interest charge for the acquisition.

There are no transactions with related parties who are not members of the Group.
The remuneration of individual directors is disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The remuneration of directors and other members of key management during the year was as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Short-term employee benefits 5,236 4,370 Post employment benefits 3 2 Equity compensation benefits 492 373 Total remuneration of directors and key management 5,731 4,745 The Company leases office premises and provides treasury management on behalf of Group companies in the UK.
Rent and service charges are charged at cost, 1,097,000 2007 1,090,000.
All income arising from cash and cash equivalents is retained by the Company.
23 Financial risk management The use of financial instruments is managed under policies and procedures approved by the Board.
These are designed to reduce the financial risks faced by the Group, which primarily relate to credit, interest, liquidity and currency risks, which arise in the normal course of the Companys and Groups business.
Credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose the Group to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.
Cash equivalents are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria.
The Group provides credit to customers in the normal course of business and the amount that appears in the balance sheet is net of an allowance of 1,369,000 2007 840,000 for specific doubtful receivables, the allowance being due to age or other issues.
In most situations where a receivable is aged but no specific allowance has been made for it no revenue has been taken and it forms part of the deferred revenue balance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
All material trade receivable balances relate to sales transactions with financial institutions.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The trade receivables for the Group as at 31st December are aged as in the table below.
There were no trade receivables for the Company.
2008 2007 000 000 Not due 28,495 14,858 Not more than three months past due 18,822 12,914 More than three months but not more than six months past due 1,964 1,242 More than six months past due 610 623 Trade receivables 49,891 29,637 Interest and liquidity risk The Group and the Company holds net funds and hence its interest and liquidity risks are associated with short-term cash deposits.
The Groups and the Companys overall objective with respect to these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of the funds, accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice this means that no deposits are made with a maturity date greater than three months.
All deposits are at current market rates.
The Group has no borrowings.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 65 Foreign currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and on the translation of the balance sheet and income statement of foreign operations into sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Euros and Japanese Yen.
The Group has both cash inflows and outflows in these currencies that create a natural hedge.
In managing currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact on short-term fluctuations on the Groups cash inflows and outflows in a foreign currency.
The Group has not entered into hedging contracts for cash positions denominated in foreign currencies.
Over the longer term permanent changes in foreign exchange would have an impact on consolidation of foreign subsidiaries earnings.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of sterling against other currencies would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 148,000 for the year ended 31st December 2008 2007: 104,000.
Capital management The Company maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain employee, customer, market, investor and creditor confidence in the business.
Special dividends have been used to return surplus capital to shareholders on two occasions in the past.
The Board monitors the retained cash and reserves and determines the level of annual dividend and when and how a return of capital to shareholders is appropriate.
Fair values Unless otherwise disclosed, there is no significant difference between the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet and the fair values of the Group and Companys financial instruments.
For current trade and other receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the amortised cost is deemed to reflect the fair value.
24 Operating leases At 31st December the Group had outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: Group 2008 2007 000 000 Less than one year 12,352 649 Between one and five years 45,490 8,013 More than five years 76,842 17,326 Total commitment under operating leases 134,684 25,988 Company 2008 2007 000 000 Less than one year 5,060 198 Between one and five years 19,196 5,221 More than five years 54,180 573 Total commitment under operating leases 78,436 5,992 The Group and the Company lease office space and data centre facilities under operating leases.
The lease term typically ranges from three years to 20 years, longer term leases normally having options to break the commitment before the end of the term.
Lease terms of greater than five years are often subject a rent review during the term.
Part of the office space has been sublet by the Company to entities outside of the Fidessa group.
The lease expires in December 2012 and the subleases expire in December 2012.
Sublease receipts of 1,553,000 are expected during the remainder of the subleases.
Fidessa group plc 66 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Accounting estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates, assumptions and judgements that are likely to contain the greatest degree of uncertainty are summarised below.
This summary is not a list of all risks faced by the group and others could arise that cause a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities.
a Development expenditure The Group invests in the development of future products and material enhancement of existing products in accordance with the accounting policy.
The assessment as to whether each element of this expenditure will be technically feasible, generate future economic benefit or the period over which to amortise the expenditure is a matter of judgement.
The carrying value of product development capitalised is detailed in note 14 and the amounts capitalised and amortised in the year are detailed in note 5. b Income taxes In recognising income tax assets and liabilities estimates have to be made of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain and on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
c Revenue The revenue for perpetual software licences and fixed price implementations is recognised on a percentage of completion basis.
Management exercises judgement in determining the percentage complete for software and consultancy revenue and the total cost of implementation.
Estimates are continually revised based on changes in the facts relating to each contract.
In recognising revenue on contracts where losses are expected the quantum of the loss has to be estimated based on the latest facts available and judgement applied to factors that are still variable.
d Fair values IFRSs require many assets, liabilities and expenses to be recognised at fair value.
This includes the intangible assets notes 13 and 14, potential gains held in escrow in respect of the sale of investment in Touchpaper note 15 and other liabilities arising from acquisitions.
By their nature fair values are estimates and subject to different interpretation.
e Impairment of goodwill The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use of the cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the cash generating units, including managements estimates of discount rates, long-term operating margins and longterm growth rates note 12.
If the results of the cash generating unit in a future period are materially adverse to the estimates used for the impairment testing an impairment charge may be triggered.
