62 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2008 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies i Corporate information Charter International plc the Company, which is the ultimate parent company of the Charter Group, is incorporated and registered in Jersey under the Jersey Companies Law as a public company limited by shares.
The Company is tax resident in the Republic of Ireland and its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchanges market for listed securities the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements for the Group were approved by the Board on 26 February 2009. ii Accounting policies The consolidated financial statements for the Group have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out below in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the European Union and implemented in the United Kingdom UK.
Although Charter International plc is incorporated and registered in Jersey under the Jersey Companies Law, the consolidated financial statements include disclosures sufficient to comply with those parts of the UK Companies Act 1985 and 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
In compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, the financial statements of Charter International plc are included within the Group Annual Report.
These are presented in sterling as that is the functional currency of that company.
The Company has elected to prepare its financial statements under UK accounting standards.
New holding company On 22 October 2008 Charter International plc became the ultimate holding company of the then Charter plc the former holding company of the Charter Group, a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales, pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under Sections 895 to 899 of the UK Companies Act 2006 that was approved by the High Court of Justice in England and Wales and the shareholders of the then Charter plc the Scheme of Arrangement.
Pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement, ordinary shares, each having a nominal value of 0.02, of the then Charter plc Charter Ordinary Shares were exchanged, on a one-for-one basis, for ordinary shares, each having a nominal value of 0.02, of Charter International plc Charter International plc Ordinary Shares.
As a result of the Scheme of Arrangement, the then Charter plc is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Charter International plc and Charter plc re-registered as a private limited company.
The Charter International plc Ordinary Shares carry substantially the same rights as did the Charter Ordinary Shares.
The Scheme of Arrangement did not involve any cash payment for the Charter Ordinary Shares.
Immediately after the Scheme of Arrangement became effective Charter International plc had the same Board of Directors, management and corporate governance arrangements as the then Charter plc had immediately prior thereto.
The consolidated assets and liabilities of Charter International plc immediately after the effective time of the Scheme of Arrangement are the same as the consolidated assets and liabilities of the then Charter plc immediately prior thereto.
Charter International plc was incorporated on 14 March 2008.
Prior to 22 October 2008 Charter International plc had not commenced trading.
All the then Charter plc share options granted to Directors and employees under share option plans that were in existence immediately prior to the Scheme of Arrangement were exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for share options in Charter International plc with no change in any terms or conditions.
The Charter International plc Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement were recorded at fair value based on the closing mid-market price of Charter Ordinary Shares on 21 October 2008, the day prior to their delisting.
This resulted in the creation of a share premium account of 646.6 million.
On 6 November 2008, following confirmation by the Jersey court, a reduction of capital became effective with all amounts then standing to the credit of the share premium account of Charter International plc being re-characterised as a distributable reserve.
The Scheme of Arrangement falls outside the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Accordingly, following the guidance regarding the selection of an appropriate accounting policy provided by IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, the Scheme of Arrangement has been accounted for in these financial statements using the principles of merger accounting.
This policy reflects the economic substance of the Scheme of Arrangement.
Although the Scheme of Arrangement did not become effective until 22 October 2008, the consolidated financial statements of Charter International plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 are presented as if the Scheme of Arrangement had been effective on 1 January 2007.
In accordance with the requirements of merger accounting, the comparative information in these consolidated financial statements has been extracted from the Charter plc consolidated statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Those financial statements incorporated the results of the then Charter plc and its subsidiary undertakings for the financial year then ended.
Earnings per share are unaffected by the Scheme of Arrangement.
In accordance with IAS 32, the transaction costs attributable to the issue of shares as part of the Scheme of Arrangement of 1.6 million have been deducted from equity, net of any related tax benefit note 22.
The other costs of implementing the Scheme of Arrangement of 2.1 million have been charged to the income statement and classified as an exceptional item note 5.
Use of adjusted measures To help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance adjusted earnings per share excludes: amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill: items which are both material and non-recurring exceptional items : and foreign currency exchange differences on the retranslation of intercompany loans, which are determined by reference to movements in exchange rates.
These amounts are likely to be volatile and are unrelated to underlying performance.
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated, in respect of the Company, its subsidiaries and associated undertakings.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value.
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 63 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
On an ongoing basis, estimates are evaluated using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods that are considered reasonable in the particular circumstances to ensure compliance with IFRS.
Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates, the effect of which is recognised in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
Should circumstances change, such that different assumptions, estimates and judgements are considered to be more appropriate, this may give rise to material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year particularly in respect of the key estimates, judgements and assumptions outlined below.
Construction contracts Revenue and profit on construction contracts are usually recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract calculated by reference to estimates of contract revenue and expected costs including provisions for warranty and product liability.
At 31 December 2008, amounts receivable payable under construction contracts were 71.9 million 2007: 55.7 million and 115.7 million 2007: 82.2 million respectively.
Contract retentions held by customers at 31 December 2008 in respect of construction contracts amounted to 40.2 million 2007: 29.3 million.
Warranty and product liability provisions at 31 December 2008 of 28.0 million 2007: 21.3 million mainly relate to construction contracts.
Employee benefits Provisions for defined benefit post-employment obligations are calculated by independent actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions and estimates used are based on independent actuarial advice and include the discount rate and estimates of life expectancy.
Other key assumptions for defined benefit post-employment obligations are based in part on market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Further information is disclosed in note 20.
At 31 December 2008, the net retirement benefit obligation was 139.3 million 2007: 76.6 million.
Goodwill impairment testing Capitalised goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Should the carrying value of the goodwill exceed its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised.
The recoverable amounts are calculated based on the estimated value in use of cash-generating units.
These calculations require estimates of cash flows, growth rates and discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with particular cash-generating units.
Further information regarding these assumptions is set out in note 10.
At 31 December 2008, the carrying amount of capitalised goodwill was 89.4 million 2007: 60.1 million.
Provisions Provision is made for liabilities that are uncertain in timing or amount of settlement.
These include provisions for legal and environmental claims.
Calculations of these provisions are based on cash flows relating to these costs estimated by management supported by the use of external consultants, discounted at an appropriate rate where the impact of discounting is material.
At 31 December 2008, these provisions amounted to 35.5 million 2007: 29.7 million.
Tax estimates The Groups tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in effect.
The determination of appropriate provisions for current and deferred income taxation requires the Group to take into account anticipated decisions of tax authorities and estimate the Groups ability to utilise tax benefits through future earnings and tax planning.
These estimates and assumptions may differ from future events.
At 31 December 2008, income tax liabilities provided were 26.1 million 2007: 27.3 million and net deferred income tax assets recognised amounted to 37.2 million 2007: 12.7 million.
Changes to accounting policies Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards that are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 and that have been adopted by the Group, but are not relevant or have an insignificant impact on the Groups financial statements: IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions provides guidance in relation to stand-alone accounts of the parent and group companies.

Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that have been published, that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods from 1 January 2009, and that the Group will apply from 1 January 2009, that are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements: IFRS 2 Amendment, Share-based payment.
The amended standard deals with vesting conditions and cancellations.
The standard replaces IAS 14, Segment reporting, and requires a management approach under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
IAS 1 Amendment, Presentation of financial statements.
The amendment clarifies that some rather than all financial assets and liabilities classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement are examples of current assets and liabilities respectively.
IAS 1 Revised, Presentation of financial statements.
Non-owner changes in equity must be presented separately from owner changes in equity and must be shown in a performance statement.
It is likely that both the income statement and statement of comprehensive income will be presented as performance statements.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale must now be included in the cost of that asset.

Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, and that the Group will apply from 1 January 2010: IFRS 3 Revised, Business combinations.
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, with some significant changes.
For example, all payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments classified as debt subsequently re-measured through the income statement.
There is a choice on an  basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
All acquisition-related costs are required to be expensed.
IFRS 5 Amendment, Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations and consequential amendment to IFRS 1, F irst-time adoption.
The amendment clarifies that all of a subsidiarys assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if a partial disposal sale plan results in loss of control.
IAS 27 Revised, Consolidated and separate financial statements.
The effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests must be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses.
Any remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
IFRIC 17, Distributions of non-cash assets to owners.
This clarifies how an entity should measure distributions of assets, other than cash, when it pays dividends to its owners.
IFRIC 18, Transfers of assets from customers.
This clarifies the accounting for arrangements where an item of property, plant and equipment, which is provided by the customer, is used to provide an ongoing service.
iii Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity.
A shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights will normally be the basis of such control.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus the costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired, including all separately identifiable intangible assets, is goodwill which has been recorded as an intangible asset since 1 January 1998 see ix a Goodwill below.
Where additional shareholdings in associate entities are acquired any fair value adjustments related to the shareholdings prior to the increase in shareholding are taken directly to equity.
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 65 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued iii Basis of consolidation continued Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, normally on the basis of a shareholding of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The Groups share of its associates post acquisition profits or losses, net of interest and tax, is recognised in the income statement and its share of post acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Intercompany balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates.
The Group has taken advantage of the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1 and has not restated business combinations that took place before 1 January 2004. iv Segmental reporting The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products that are subject to risks and returns that are different from other business segments.
Segmental assets comprise total assets excluding income tax assets.
Segmental liabilities comprise total liabilities excluding income tax liabilities and borrowings other than bank overdrafts.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Revenue by geographic segment is allocated based on the country in which the customer is located.
Assets and capital expenditure by geographic segment are allocated based on where the assets are located.
v Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements for each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency and presentation currency of Charter International plc.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of Group entities using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement except where deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
The results and net assets of all Group companies that have non-sterling functional currency are included in the consolidated financial statements as follows: a Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date: b Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant period: and c All resulting exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to shareholders equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
vi Financial assets The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of an asset at initial recognition and re-evaluates its designation at each reporting date.
Assets are classified as: loans and receivables: held to maturity investments: available for sale financial assets: or financial assets where changes in fair value are charged or credited to the income statement.
Available for sale financial assets include non-derivatives not classified in any of the other categories.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification.
On initial recognition loans and receivables and held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Available for sale financial assets and financial assets where changes in fair value are charged or credited to the income statement are subsequently measured at fair value.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit and loss category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified as available for sale are recognised in equity.
When securities classified as available for sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are included in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired or has been transferred, and the Company has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
They are classified as current if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
vii Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps, that are used as hedges in the financing and financial risk management of the Group are categorised as hedges.
Derivative financial instruments categorised as hedges are initially measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities fair value hedge : 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedge : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedge.
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 66 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued vii Financial instruments continued For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement generally as part of financing.
When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in shareholders equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in shareholders equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.
For net investment hedges gains and losses accumulated in shareholders equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the income statement generally as part of financing.
viii Property, plant and equipment The Groups policy is to carry property, plant and equipment at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses except that certain properties were revalued on transition to IFRS at 1 January 2004.
These revaluations are treated as deemed cost as at 1 January 2004 as allowed by IFRS 1.
In accordance with the benchmark treatment under IFRS, borrowing costs associated with expenditure on property, plant and equipment are not capitalised.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method spreading the difference between cost and residual value over the estimated useful life as follows: Buildings 30-50 years Plant, machinery and equipment 8-14 years Vehicles 5 years IT equipment 3-5 years An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount see x Impairment of assets below.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
ix Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary or associate acquired.
Goodwill, represented by the carrying value at 1 January 2004 under the Groups previous accounting policy together with additional amounts arising since that date, is no longer amortised and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is included in intangible assets in relation to subsidiaries and in investments in associates in relation to associates.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the classification and accounting treatment of business combinations has not been restated on transition to IFRS, as permitted by IFRS 1.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 was written off directly to reserves.
Goodwill arising in the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2003 was capitalised as an intangible asset in relation to subsidiaries and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, a period not exceeding 20 years or included as part of the carrying value of associates.
Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the balance sheet is allocated to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
b Research and development Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible assets, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life of the asset created, usually between 3 and 10 years.
c Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the licence, usually between 3 and 7 years.
Internal expenditure associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, except for such costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group that are likely to generate benefits exceeding costs beyond 1 year which are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software product, usually less than 7 years.
d Intangibles arising on acquisitions In establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities arising on acquisitions the Group identifies the fair values attributable to intangible assets.
The intangible assets recognised include the value in respect of brands and trademarks, intellectual property rights, customer contracts and relationships and proprietary technology rights and know-how.
All intangibles recognised on business combinations are amortised over the expected useful economic lives, usually between 3 and 10 years.
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 67 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued x Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
xi Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in first-out FIFO basis or the average cost basis.
Cost includes expenditure which is incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all disposal costs to be incurred.
xii Assets held for sale Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable within one year from the date of classification.
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and cease to be depreciated from the date of classification.
xiii Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Trade receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Amounts due after more than 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified in the balance sheet as non-current.
xiv Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
xv Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
xvi Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Groups interest in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the gain or loss on the borrowings that are determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity.
Gains and losses accumulated in shareholders equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
xvii Taxation Taxation is that chargeable on the profits for the period, together with deferred income taxation.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity including actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit obligations see xviii Employee benefits below and share-based payments see xix Share-based payments below, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income taxation liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income taxation is not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the resulting temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or where the remittance would not give rise to incremental tax liabilities or is otherwise not taxable.
xviii Employee benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar post-retirement benefits principally healthcare under IAS 19 Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit pension plans, where the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is defined by the plan, the liability recorded in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined obligation at that date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with an adjustment for any unrecognised past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur directly in equity, in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Taxation attributable to actuarial gains and losses is taken to equity.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period, in which case the past service costs are spread over that period.
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 68 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued xviii Employee benefits continued For defined benefit schemes, the amount charged to operating profit in the income statement comprises the current service cost, past service cost and the impact of any settlements or curtailments.
Interest on plan liabilities and the expected return on plan assets is included within financing in the income statement.
For defined contribution plans, where the Group pays a fixed contribution into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions irrespective of whether or not the fund has sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to service in the current and prior periods, the contributions are recognised as an expense when they are due.
For other defined benefit post-employment obligations, principally post-employment medical arrangements in the US, a similar accounting methodology to that for defined benefit pension plans is used.
Where the actuarial valuation of a scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognised asset is limited to the extent that the Group can benefit in future, for example, by refunds or a reduction in contributions.
Movements in the amount of any irrecoverable surplus are recognised directly in equity, in the statement of recognised income and expense.
xix Share-based payments The Group operates both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the income statement.
In the case of equity-settled plans the fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
This expense is spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The corresponding entry is credited to equity.
Taxation attributable to the excess of the fair value over the charge to the income statement is taken to equity.
The liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards is re-measured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Cash-settled plans are measured on a similar basis except that the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date, with changes recognised in the income statement.
For cash-settled plans the corresponding entry is included as a liability.
xx Government grants Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the grant are met.
Where they relate to specific assets they are amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the asset is depreciated.
Where they relate to revenue expenditure and or non-asset criteria they are taken to the income statement to match the period in which the expenditure is incurred and criteria met.
xxi Provisions for other liabilities Provisions for disposal and restructuring costs, warranty and product liability, and legal and environmental liability are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If all these conditions are not met then no provision is recognised.
Incurred but not reported IBNR amounts are included in provisions.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected value of future cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
xxii Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Share issue costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid is deducted from Group equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
xxiii Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services and the value of work executed during the year in respect of construction contracts.
Revenue, which is recorded net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts, and after eliminating intra-group sales, is recognised as follows: a Sales of goods and services The majority of the Groups revenues relate to the sale of goods and services which are recognised when a Group entity has fulfilled its contractual obligations to a customer and has obtained the right to receive consideration.
In respect of the sale of goods this is usually on despatch but is dependent upon the contractual terms that have been agreed with a customer.
b Construction contracts Revenue is recognised by a Group entity in accordance with the stage of completion of its contractual obligations to the customer.
The stage of completion is usually based on the proportion of costs incurred compared to the total expected costs to complete the contract, where this also represents a right to receive consideration, and provided the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period in which the loss first becomes foreseeable.
Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract.
xxiv Leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as an obligation under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest repayment elements.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element charged to income so as to give a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance outstanding at each accounting period.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
xxv Dividend distribution Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the accounts in the period when paid.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of 0.2 million 2007: 0.5 million dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the potentially issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.
To help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill, exceptional items and exchange gains and losses on retranslation of intercompany loans, including attributable tax and minority interests, are excluded from the calculations of adjusted earnings per share as set out in the following table.
It should be noted that the term adjusted is not defined under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures of profit.

Management estimates discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and internal forecasts.
Selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.

CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 77 11 Property, plant and equipment continued ii The Group tests for impairment of property, plant and equipment when there are indications that such assets might be impaired.
In view of the trading performance, start-up costs and challenging economic environment in China, the Directors have conducted an impairment review in respect of the property, plant and equipment of ESAB China and, as a result, continue to believe that the fair value of these tangible assets is in excess of carrying value.
When determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment, independent third party advice was obtained.
Where no such evidence existed, a value in use calculation was performed.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected sales values and direct costs during the period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts from the most recent budgets approved by management for the next two years and extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on estimated growth rates.
These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.

The Group also provides post-employment medical benefits in the United States.
The valuation of United Kingdom and overseas defined benefit pension schemes and the liability for United States post-employment medical benefits are assessed by professionally qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: 2008 2007 UK Overseas UK Overseas %% %% Discount rate 6.30 5.60 5.80 6.00 Inflation rate 2.60 2.60 3.40 2.60 Expected return on plan assets equities 7.50 8.80 8.00 9.00 bonds 4.50 5.60 4.80 5.60 property 7.00 7.50 other 3.00 5.15 5.75 6.10 total 5.70 7.00 6.30 7.25 Future salary increases 3.60 3.45 4.40 4.00 Future pension increases 2.80 1.95 3.45 2.25 Medical costs inflation ultimate rate 5.00 5.00 The mortality assumptions for the UK schemes are based on either the PA92 or PA00 standard mortality tables after retirement with allowance for future mortality improvements and scheme specific factors.
Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 27 years 2007: 26 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 30 years 2007: 29 years after retirement if they are female.
A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on average for a further 26 years 2007: 25 years if they are male and for a further 29 years 2007: 28 years if they are female.
The overseas schemes are principally in the United States.
The mortality assumptions for the United States schemes have been derived from the RP-2000 table with allowance for further mortality improvements.
Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 24 years 2007: 24 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 26 years 2007: 26 years after retirement if they are female.
A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on average for a further 23 years 2007: 23 years if they are male and for a further 25 years 2007: 25 years if they are female.
Mortality assumptions for schemes in Sweden and Germany have been derived from the FFFS 2007 tables and the Heubeck 2005 G tables respectively.
The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long-term results for the various asset classes.
Equity returns are developed based on the selection of the equity risk premium above the risk-free rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes holdings of these instruments.
Other class asset returns are determined by reference to current experience.

21 Financial instruments and risk management i Financial risk management The international profile of Charters operations expose it to financial risks including the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
The Board sets policies to address these risks and there is a specific treasury policy setting out guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments.
Charters central treasury department is responsible for ensuring there are appropriate funding arrangements to meet the ongoing requirements of the Group and for managing effectively liquid funds held in the Group.
Regular cash flow forecasts are prepared by subsidiaries and reviewed by management.
In addition, it is responsible for managing the interest rate risks and balance sheet foreign currency translation risks of the Group within guidelines agreed by the Board.
Foreign currency transaction risks are generally managed directly by operating subsidiaries in accordance with guidelines and controls defined in the treasury policy.
a Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations mainly from its own cash resources.
It is the Groups objective to minimise the cost of borrowings and maximise the value from cash resources, whilst retaining the flexibility of funding opportunities.
If considered appropriate, the Group would use interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 89 21 Financial instruments and risk management continued i Financial risk management continued b Currency risk The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in Europe and America, and recurring exposures to exchange rate fluctuations in respect of foreign currency transactions.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the Groups balance sheet and income statement.
The Group seeks to comply with the requirements of hedge accounting where considered appropriate.
Subject to Board approval, balance sheet translation exposures may be mitigated through the use of currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives.
As noted below the Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge part or all of the net investment in subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro or the US dollar.
Foreign currency transaction exposures result from sales or purchases by subsidiaries in a currency other than their functional currency.
Forward foreign exchange contracts may be used to hedge the net cash flows resulting from these transactions to the extent these are certain or highly probable.
c Financial credit risk The principal credit risks relate to the failure of dealing counterparties for foreign currency transactions and financial institutions with whom surplus funds are deposited in the short term.
Charters central treasury department monitors regularly the credit status of such counterparties and financial institutions, as well as the location of surplus cash worldwide with credit limits being set and subject to regular review.
d Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain committed facilities to ensure that, together with cash flows generated from operations, there are sufficient funds for current operations and their future requirements.
During the year the Group increased its principal committed facilities by 70 million to 145 million, which have maturity dates in 2011 and 2013.
Charters central treasury department reviews weekly cash balances held worldwide to ensure that optimal use is made of liquid funds within the Group and to avoid unnecessary borrowing.
e Capital management The Group aims to manage its capital structure in order to safeguard the going concern of the Group and to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
Capital is regarded as consisting of total equity, net cash and retirement benefit obligations.

L. C. and certain of their wholly owned subsidiaries have been named as defendants the defendants in asbestos-related actions in the United States.
These lawsuits have alleged that the defendants were liable for the acts of Cape PLC, a former partly owned subsidiary of Charter Limited.
Between 1985 and 1987, the issue was tried in several matters, each of which was resolved in the defendants favour either at trial or on appeal.
In subsequent years, the defendants have continued to be named in asbestos-related lawsuits.
The defendants have contested these actions and, in most cases, have obtained dismissals.
The defendants have settled some of the cases brought in Mississippi.
Currently, the only pending cases against the defendants in which they have received service of process are in Mississippi, which cases are dormant and are not actively being pursued by plaintiffs.
The Directors have received legal advice that the defendants and their wholly owned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action.
It is not practicable to estimate in any particular case the amount of damages which might ensue if liability were imposed on any of the defendants.
The defence costs and other expenses charged against Charters operating profits in 2008 were negligible.
The litigation is reviewed each year and, based on that review and legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate to make provision for any liability in respect of such actions.
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 95 27 Contingent liabilities continued ii Air and gas handling Howden Buffalo Inc. an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos-related actions in the United States.
On the advice of counsel, Howden Buffalo is vigorously defending all the cases that have been filed against it.
Over the past few years, Howden Buffalo has sought and received dismissals in 10,722 cases and has, on the advice of counsel, settled 372 cases.
These cases were all settled for nuisance value amounts, much less than the cost of defending the cases at trial.
Howden Buffalo has received legal advice indicating that it should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions that are brought.
At this time, it is not practical to estimate the amount of any potential damages or to provide details of the current stage of proceedings in particular cases, as the majority of cases do not specify the amount of damages sought and the cases are at varying stages in the litigation process.
However, legal fees associated with the defence of these claims and the cost of the settlements have been covered by applicable insurance.
The Directors believe, based on legal advice, that the majority of asbestos-related lawsuits against Howden Buffalo, including those resulting from the historical operations of a predecessor of Howden Buffalo known as Buffalo Forge Company, will continue to be covered, in substantial part, by applicable insurance.
The situation is reviewed regularly and based on the most recent review and legal advice obtained by Howden Buffalo, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any potential liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
iii Welding The ESAB Group Inc. EGI, an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits in state and federal courts in the United States alleging personal injuries from exposure to manganese in the fumes of welding consumables.
Other current and former manufacturers of welding consumables have also been named as defendants as well as various other defendants such as distributors, trade associations and others.
The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts.
A multi-district litigation proceeding has been established to consolidate and co-ordinate pre-trial proceedings in the federal court cases.
A summary of recent cases tried to jury verdict in which EGI was a defendant are set out below: Post trial Compensatory Punitive Number motions or damages damages of defendants appeal in Date of verdict Court Nature of verdict Number of claimants US$m US$m sharing award progress December 2007 Federal Plaintiff 1 20.5 4 Yes i March 2008 Federal Plaintiff 1 0.72 1.7 3Yes March 2008 State Defendants 4 5 No November 2008 State Plaintiff 1 1.855 2 Yes November 2008 Federal Defendants 1 3 No February 2009 State Defendants 1 3 No i EGIs share is US$0.75 million.
EGI was also a defendant in a number of other state court cases set for trial in 2008.
However, all of those cases were either dismissed or postponed.
With the exception of the punitive damage award, if upheld on appeal, EGIs share of the adverse verdicts rendered in December 2007 and March and November 2008 should be covered in substantial part by insurance.
There are 9 manganese trials scheduled for the balance of 2009, although it is not anticipated that they will all proceed to trial as scheduled.
Additional trials could also be scheduled.
Over the last 17 years, the Welding Industry Defense group, which was established to represent a number of the welding company defendants in this litigation, has succeeded in obtaining defence verdicts in the vast majority of cases in which one or more of its members have been named as a defendant.
Whilst litigation is notoriously uncertain and the risk of an adverse jury verdict in any trial exists, having considered the advice of EGIs counsel in the United States, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims, most of which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance.
EGI, in conjunction with other current and former US manufacturers of welding consumables, is defending these claims vigorously.
The defence costs, net of insurance recoveries, are estimated to be of the order of US$16.9 million, which is reflected in EGIs balance sheet at 31 December 2008.
In view of the foregoing and, in particular, the legal advice received in the United States, the Directors do not consider that such claims will have a material adverse effect on Charters financial position.
EGI has also been named as a defendant in a small number of lawsuits in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in which claimants allege asbestos induced personal injuries.
The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts from EGI, other welding consumable manufacturers and other defendants who manufactured a variety of asbestos products.
Two cases are listed for trial in 2009: however, EGI has been dismissed prior to trial in the previous cases in which it was named as a defendant.
Upon the advice of counsel, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims and EGI intends vigorously to defend these lawsuits, which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance.
In addition, the majority of defence costs are being borne by EGIs insurers.
iv Other In addition there are contingent liabilities entered into in the normal course of business from which no liability is expected to arise.
