Goodwill at 31 March 2008 was primarily allocated to cash generating units CGUs in QNA: Technology Solutions 85.0m, Systems Engineering 59.5m, IT Services 169.9m and Mission Solutions 84.5m.
Other allocations of goodwill include goodwill in relation to HVR, Boldon James, Verhaert and the three Australian acquisitions.
Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected synergies, future growth prospects and staff knowledge, expertise and customer contacts.
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually and uses discounted cash flow as the recoverable amount.
The Group has made a number of assumptions in determining the value in use of goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit.
It is assumed that cash generating units perform to the five-year corporate plan.
This is consistent with the current and prior performance of the cash generating units and current UK and US defence and security spending forecasts.
The estimates of the long-term growth rates for the CGUs are based on macro-economic assumptions and do not exceed the long-term estimate for the sectors in which CGUs operate.
Future cash flows have been discounted at a post-tax discount rate of 8.7%.
Sensitivity analysis has indicated that no reasonably foreseeable changes in the key assumptions in the impairment model would result in significant impairment charges being recorded in the financial statements.
