Borrowing facilities and liquidity risk We manage our liquidity requirements by the use of both shortand long-term cash flow forecasts.
The Group has maintained committed banking facilities to mitigate any liquidity risk it may face.
There were committed senior debt facilities at 31 March 2008 of 400 million 2007 - 400 million of which 70 million had been drawn down at 31 March 2008 2007 - 97.2 million.
The following table analyses the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable calculated using forward spot interest rates : the carrying values and the fair values of Group borrowings at the balance sheet date.
The Group also has short-term receivables and payables that arise in the normal course of business and these are not included in the following table.
Any cash flows based on floating rate interest are based on interest rates prevailing at 31 March in the relevant year.
All derivative amounts are shown gross, although amounts are settled net wherever possible.
Amounts drawn under the revolving credit facility are treated as due within one year with interest calculated as payable at the end of the first half of the next financial year.
The fair values of borrowings are based on clean market prices at year end or, where these are not available, on the quoted prices of comparable debt issued by other companies.
The Groups interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income and cash flow statements at the same time as the interest is recognised and paid on the underlying hedged debt.
