Under the terms of the Executive Schemes, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may approve the grant of options to employees of the Group to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company.
Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan the US Plan are to acquire ADSs or Ordinary Shares.
For options granted prior to 2001, the option price was not less than the market value of an Ordinary Share, or the nominal value if higher the market value being the quoted price on the business day preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant.
For Executive Schemes adopted in 2001 and 2004, the market value is the average quoted price of an OrdinaryShare for the three business days preceding the date of grant or, for the US Plan, the average quoted price of an ADS or Ordinary Share, for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant if higher.
With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan, the exercise of options granted from 1997 are subject to achievement of a performance condition.
Options granted under the 2001 US Plan are not subject to any performance conditions.
Prior to 2008, the 2001 US Plan options become cumulatively exercisable as to 10% after one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years.
With effect from 2008, the 2001 US Plan options granted become cumulatively exercisable as to 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remainingbalance after the third year.
The 1990 International Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2004 Plan are open to senior managers worldwide.
The 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan is open to senior managers outsidetheUS andtheUS , Canada, MexicoandPuertoRico.
The maximum term of options granted, under all schemes, is 10 years from the date of grant.

Share Based Payments Share Option Schemes continued The weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at 31 December 2008 was 4.6 2007 4.9 years, 2006 5.3 years years for Executive Schemes and 1.7 2007 2.5 years, 2006 2.7years years forEmployeeSchemes.

Options granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006 under the executive schemes were valued using a binomial model.
Options granted under employee schemes were valued using the Black-Scholes option model as management considered that options granted under these schemes are exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date.
Options granted under each scheme are valued separately and a weighted average fairvaluecalculated.
The binomial model was used for executive schemes so that proper allowanceis made for the possibility of early exercise.
At the 2008 grant management expected 95% of the options granted under the 2001 Executive Scheme to vest 2007 95%, 2006 95% and 60% of the 2004 Executive Scheme to vest 2007 60%, 200660%.
Each year an assessment is made of the current vesting estimates and they are updated to reflect revised expectations of the number of grants that will vest.
This includes the effects of any modifications to the share schemes during the year.
In 2005 the Group announced its intention to report its results in US Dollars with effect from 2006.
For the 2005 awards, the Remuneration Committee decided to retain the same performance targets but base them on US Dollar numbers over the life of the award.
In order to reflect the different EPSA growths under US Dollar reporting the estimates of final vesting were amended for schemes with this criteria.
To the extent that this is a modification, there was no effect on the charge in the income statement.
Commencing in 2006 the impact on the share based payment charge in the income statement over the life of the options was an additional charge of approximately $1m.
Therewas noeffect  payments as aresult ofthischange.

This is based on a mixture of historic experience and generally accepted behavioural traits.

In addition, 50% 2007 50%, 2006 50% of Executive Scheme option holders are assumed to exercise by choice per annum providing the gain available is at least 50% for the 2004 Plan and 25% for the 2001 Plans 2007 50% for the 2004 Plan and 25% for the 2001 Plans, 2006 50%forthe2004 Planand 25%forthe2001 Plans.

Share Based Payment Long-Term Incentive Plans The Group operated a long-term incentive plan LTIP for executive directors and executive officers from 1997 to 2003.
Vesting of LTIP awards was dependent on the Groups relative performance in a group of 39 UK listed manufacturing companies with substantial international activities, using total shareholder return TSR  theprimemeasure.
In 2004, a new share based incentive plan was introduced for executive directors, executive officers and the next level of senior executives, which replaced the LTIP.
The plan includes a Performance Share Plan PSP  CIP.
Vesting of the PSP award shares is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based  industry.
Under the CIP, participants can elect to use up to a maximum of one-halfof their annualbonus to purchase shares.
If the shares are held for 3 years and the Groups EPSA growth targets are achieved participants  .
The fair values of awards granted under long-term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model.
The exercise price for all awards granted under the long-term incentive plans is nil.
The LTIP and PSP contain vesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group which represent market-based performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date calculations.
The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups.
Given the wide range of companies within the FTSE 100 a correlation of 15% 2007 20%, 2006 20% has been assumed with the constituents of the group.
A correlation of 15% 2007 20%, 2006 30% has also been assumed for the companies in the medical devices sector as they are .
The other assumptions used are consistent with the executive scheme assumptions disclosed in Note 28 a .
From 2009, the CIP will be replaced by a deferred bonus plan.
This plan is designed to encourage executives to build-upand maintaina  Company.
Under the plan, onethirdof any bonus earned at target level or above by anexecutive directorwillbe compulsorilydeferred intoshares whichvest, subject to continuedemployment, inequal annualtranches over three years i. e. one thirdeach year.
