We specialise in owning, developing, managing, selling and delivering sustainable value from residential property.
We have a unique blend of expertise gained from owning and managing properties in local communities for many years.
Our wealth of experience is invaluable in our task to manage the business through this challenging time.
Our strategy Our long-term strategy remains unchanged.
At our core, we have an irreplaceable portfolio of regulated properties, which generates regular cash flow through sales following natural vacancies.
Our properties have continued to be desirable as they fall in an affordable price bracket and provide purchasers with refurbishment opportunities.
It is also possible to sell these properties tenanted making them attractive liquid assets.
We use our skills and experience of the market to ensure we sell to deliver the best possible value.
Graingers Bridgewater business is also an industry leader in home reversion plans, which offer equity release for the elderly.
Bridgewater is the first home reversion provider to be awarded the Best Home Reversion Provider for three years in a row at the prestigious Mortgage Solutions Equity Release Awards.
Grainger has an overall market share of some 35%.
We are constantly broadening our portfolio of products and properties in this area, to include other solutions for retirement living, recognising a major area of growth over the coming years.
Our development business gives us further insight into the residential property market.
We take a long-term approach where we can see strategic land opportunities.
More recently we have recognised the benefits of working with partners to deliver large, mixed use schemes.
Over the last few years we have capitalised on our strengths and skills in the UK to enter the German residential market.
This year we achieved critical mass of over 500m of property following the successful acquisition of Francono Rhein-Main AG.
We have utilised those same abilities to launch and become fund, asset and property manager of G:res1, a residential property fund in which Grainger co-invests.
These diversifications have spread our risk and reduced our dependency on the UK residential market.
When appropriate opportunities arise, we will continue to leverage our capabilities.
4 Grainger plc annual review 2008 Our aim is to maintain and consolidate our position as the UKs leading quoted residential property company.
To do this we aim, over the long term to: provide superior risk-adjusted returns: maximise the efficiency of our capital structure by introducing third-party equity and debt through residential property funds: enter new residential sectors where we can use our management skills and resources to build large portfolios: diversify income streams to include fund management fees alongside co-investment growth: continue to build on our unique position as a long-term holder, asset manager, trader and developer of residential property: use our skills and property network reputation to integrate developing, managing and funding: and encourage and capitalise on the growing recognition of residential property as an investment class.
These aims are underpinned by our group-wide ethical way of doing business.
This includes commitment to integrity in all business relationships, employee development, tenant care, environmental responsibility and community service.
In the short to medium term our plans for growth will be undoubtedly dampened by the economic climate.
Our focus is fundamentally on managing the business in a prudent way, as we have done through previous downturns in the cycle.
In practice this means focusing our efforts on maximising cash flow and delivering covenant compliance.
