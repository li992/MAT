33 Share-based payments The group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan comprising awards under a long-term incentive scheme LTIS and a save as you earn SAYE scheme.
Awards under the LTIS for 2006 and prior are subject to market performance conditions under which the total shareholder return TSR of the company is measured against a peer group.
There is no vesting below median performance.
If the company TSR equals the median of the peer group 40% will vest.
If the groups TSR is equal to or greater than the upper quartile TSR of the peer group, 100% will vest.
At points between the median and upper quartile of the peer group there is pro rata vesting between 40% and 100%.
Awards under the LTIS for 2006 and prior have been valued at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
For awards under the 2008 and 2007 LTIS, one third are subject to an absolute total shareholder return performance condition measured over three years from the date of grant and two thirds are subject to annual growth in Net Net Net Asset Value NNNAV measured over three years from the date of grant.
One third of the awards, therefore, are subject to a market-based performance condition and these have been valued at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The remaining two thirds of the awards are subject to a non-market-based performance condition and have been valued at fair value using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
