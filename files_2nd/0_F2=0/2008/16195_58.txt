Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries and oil and gas assets continued iii Acquisition of subsidiaries The Group acquired Hardman Resources Limited with effect from 20 December 2006, and completed the acquisition on 10 January 2007.
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities were reassessed in 2007, to reflect additional information which has become available concerning conditions that existed at the date of acquisition, in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business combinations.
The resulting changes to the 2007 financial statements are set out in the following table: Fair value as 2007 2007 previously Fair value Fair value reported adjustment as restated 000 000 000 Intangible exploration and evaluation assets 623,542 48,959 672,501 Property, plant and equipment 86,931 39,489 47,442 Inventories 3,866 3,866 Other current assets 10,790 10,790 Cash and cash equivalents 46,540 46,540 Trade and other payables 11,480 11,480 Derivative financial instruments 1,147 1,147 Deferred tax liabilities 158,842 9,020 167,862 Provisions 5,463 5,463 Total cost of acquisition 594,737 450 595,187 Satisfied by: 359,566 Cash 235,621 Shares issued 595,187 The principal fair value adjustments are in respect of property, plant and equipment, where Chinguetti commercial reserves have been downgraded by 50%, intangible exploration and evaluation assets where additional fair value has been ascribed to the African and South American assets, and the deferred tax effect of these adjustments.
Due to the inherently uncertain nature of the oil and gas industry and intangible exploration evaluation assets in particular, the assumptions underlying the final assigned values are highly judgemental in nature.
The purchase consideration equals the aggregate of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Hardman, and therefore no goodwill has been recorded on the acquisition.
Deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the fair value adjustments as applicable.
