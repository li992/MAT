These calculations use discounted pretax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period and are based on past experience.
Cash flows beyond the three year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates in the range 2% to 5%.
These growth rates reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU operates.
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 8%.
In determining the discount rate, management considered the Groups weighted average cost of capital and the Groups incremental borrowing rates.
The discount rate best reflects the risks associated with the cash flows and the likely external rate of borrowing of the cash generating units.
Consideration has also been given to other risks such as currency risk and country risk.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
