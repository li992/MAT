This excludes portfolio restructuring costs, amortisation of intangible assets recognised on acquisition, costs charged post-acquisition for acquired share options and costs associated with the terminated acquisition as above.
Portfolio restructuring During 2008 the Group continued with the portfolio restructuring strategy announced in 2005.
Principal projects in 2008 include the rationalisation of Cobham Mission Systems Divisions US production facilities, the consolidation of the Cobham Avionics and Surveillance Divisions Idaho, USA, flight instrumentation technical centre into its newly acquired facility in Texas, USA, and the transfer of audio radio communications businesses to an existing facility in Arizona.
Restructuring projects in 2007 also included the consolidation of the diving products business based in Mississauga, Canada, into existing facilities in Iowa, USA and the integration of the antennas business based in Southampton, UK, into the new purpose designed facility in Marlow, UK.
The profits on disposal of discontinued activities before tax relate to businesses disposed of in prior years as detailed in note 33.
Profits from all of these activities have been excluded from trading profit and underlying earnings for the Group.

Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group manages a number of defined contribution pension arrangements.
The total expense recognised in the income statement of 17.9m 2007: 9.1m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
There were no significant contributions outstanding at the end of 2008 or 2007 for the defined benefit schemes.
12.2m 2007: 0.8m was outstanding in respect of defined contribution schemes but not due for payment at 31 December 2008.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan CPP, which is a funded defined benefit scheme.
The assets of all of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
From 1 January 2003, new employees in the UK have only been able to join the defined contribution scheme.
In the USA, the Carleton Technologies defined benefit scheme has been closed to new members from 13 December 2003.
Special contributions of 6.3m were paid in 2008 2007: 5.3m to the CPP as agreed in connection with the disposal of the Fluid and Air group which completed in 2005.
Actuarial valuations of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP are carried out on a triennial basis by qualified independent actuaries, the most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2006.
The actuarial valuations were updated by qualified independent actuaries for accounting purposes to 31 December 2008.
Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable country regulations.
For the purposes of IAS 19, the principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2008 2007 UK schemes USA scheme UK schemes USA scheme Rate of increase in salary costs 3.50% 3.50% 3.80% 3.80% Discount rate 6.30% 6.30% 5.82% 5.82% Inflation assumption 3.00% 3.00% 3.30% 3.30% Expected return on scheme assets 5.82% 6.42% 6.60% 7.06% Pensions increase unless overridden by specific scheme rules 3.00% n a 3.30% n a The mortality assumptions used for the CPP are based upon actual recent mortality experiences of members within the scheme and also allow for future mortality improvements.
The mortality assumption used in 2008 is denoted by actuaries as PA92 year of birth projections long cohort.
The mortality assumption used in 2007 was PA92 year of birth projections medium cohort.
In practical terms this is demonstrated in the table below: Further life expectancy Year of birth Year age 65 2008 2007 Male 1943 2008 23.7 years 22.0 years Male 1980 2045 25.4 years 23.7 years Cobham plc 67 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued At 31 December 2008 it has been assumed that members will commute on average 20% 2007: 20% of their pension for cash at retirement.
This implies a full take-up of the permitted 25% 2007: 25% commutation by approximately 80% 2007: 80% of eligible members on retirement.
The sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in certain key assumptions is provided below: increasing the discount rate by 0.1% to 6.4% would decrease scheme liabilities by 8.1m: increasing the inflation rate by 0.1% to 3.1% would increase scheme liabilities by 6.3m: if each scheme member was expected to live for an additional year then scheme liabilities would increase by 12.2m.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes are as follows: m 2008 2007 Present value of funded obligations 458.4 457.7 Fair value of scheme assets 407.2 420.5 Net liability 51.2 3 7.
2 The present value of funded obligations relating to the US scheme is US$19.8m 2007: US$20.7m and the fair value of scheme assets relating to the US scheme is US$13.6m 2007: US$18.3m.
The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.

The liabilities of the scheme were valued by an independent actuary as at 31 December 2008 at 2.9m and are recorded in these financial statements at 2.8m 2007: 2.1m.
These liabilities are included in other liabilities in note 21.

The PSP scheme allows for annual grants of conditional shares at nil cost which vest 50% based on the Groups three year Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to that of a sector comparator group and 50% based on the growth of the Groups underlying EPS over the same period.
Under the ESOS, options are granted at a price not less than the market value of the Groups Ordinary Shares on, or shortly before, the date the options are granted.
Exercise is conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over a three year period.
The scheme also includes a time-only section which is offered to participants based in the USA.
This allows for options to be granted with 25% vesting on each annual anniversary conditional only on continued employment within the Group.
The BCP scheme allows participants to defer up to 50% of their net earned annual bonus into Cobham shares in return for an opportunity to earn up to a 2:1 matching award of shares, based on three year Economic Profit growth targets.
A number of awards are still outstanding under the Cobham Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP under which awards were made at nil cost, vesting over a three year performance period based on the Groups TSR relative to that of a comparator group and also conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over the same period.
The last awards made under this scheme were in 2006, vesting subject to the conditions in 2009.
Further details of all schemes can be found in the Directors remuneration report on pages 41 and 42.
In addition, entry to the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme ShareSave is available to all employees of participating subsidiaries.
Employees may purchase the Groups shares at 80% of the closing market price on the date of grant during a two-week period each year, up to a maximum contribution value of 3,000 in any one year.
The shares so purchased are generally placed in the employees share savings plan and will only be released to employees who remain in the Groups employment for a period of three years from the date of grant.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Participants of the PSP scheme receive the benefit of dividend payments and therefore dividend yields are not taken into consideration in the valuation model.
Cash settled share-based payment schemes During 2006 and 2007, the Group issued share appreciation rights SARs and awards under a phantom LTIP scheme to certain senior executives that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the award to the employee at the date of exercise.
No further awards have been made under these schemes.
The expense for the year for these rights is based on the fair value of the outstanding liability at the balance sheet date of 0.4m at 31 December 2008 2007: 0.4m.
SARs were granted at a price not less than the market value of the Groups Ordinary Shares on, or shortly before, the date the rights were granted.
As with the ESOS awards, exercise is conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over a three year period and is possible between three and ten years after grant.
Phantom LTIP awards were made at nil cost, vesting over a three year performance period based on the Groups TSR relative to that of a comparator group and also conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over the same period.
The comparator group and conditions are the same as those which apply for LTIPs.

Acquisition related share-based payments The agreement for the acquisition of SPARTA Inc by Cobham provided for unvested equity-settled options held by employees of SPARTA at the date of acquisition to be replaced with cash-settled option rights.
These were issued on 3 June 2008 and vest over a maximum of three years, based on the vesting date of the original options.
The new awards are conditional only upon an employees continued employment to the vesting date.
The average exercise price based on the original options of each new right granted is 1.160 and the latest vesting date is 9 January 2011.
The rights vest at a price linked to the market price of Cobham plcs shares with a minimum value at the date of vesting, based on the market value of Cobham shares on 3 June 2008, of 2.0925.
A portion of the fair value of the rights at the date of issue associated with pre-acquisition service has been allocated to the cost of acquisition as detailed in note 32, and the liability for this element at the balance sheet date is included within contingent consideration shown in note 22.
The fair value of the total outstanding liability for these cash-settled awards at 31 December 2008 was 8.2m, of which the majority is reflected within contingent consideration.
The total expense for the year impacting the income statement is 3.1m: this is included within acquisition related adjustments and excluded from underlying earnings as described in note 7.

Other intangible assets represent purchased and acquired patents, licences and trademarks, software rights and licences and the order backlog of acquired businesses at the date of acquisition.
All of these assets are recognised at fair value and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
The fair values of acquired intangible assets have been assessed by reference to the future estimated cash flows arising from the application of assets, discounted to present value at a post-tax rate of 7.6% 2007: 7.6%.

Goodwill is allocated to approximately 40 CGUs.
The Group tests goodwill impairment for each CGU annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations unless specific conditions at a CGU dictate otherwise.
For both the current and comparative years there have been no such exceptions.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and operating cash projections during the period for which management have detailed plans.
Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the Groups time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured.
The growth rates are based on long term GDP projections of the primary geographic market for the CGU.
For the first five years only, the long term GDP projections are adjusted to recognise an estimate of the historic and projected premium of 1% associated with the high technological content associated with the business.
The long term projections used are in the range 2.5% to 3.5%.
The growth rates are determined annually by reference to projected GDP growth rates and any variation from this is validated with reference to projections by industry bodies such as the Aerospace Industries Association.
They assume that demand for our products in the USA and in the UK remains broadly in line with the underlying economic environment in the long term future.
Taking into account our expectation of future market conditions we believe that the evolution of selling prices and direct costs will reflect past practices.
78 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 www.
com Group financial statements The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the coming year and extrapolates cash flows after that period based on growth rates as described above.
Exceptionally, where a CGU is not in steady state we have used specific financial plans prepared and approved by Group management.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10.6% 2007: 10.6%.
Following detailed review, no impairment losses have been recognised in the period.
The goodwill allocated to each of SPARTA, Lansdale and M A-COM US are considered to be individually significant as they represent more than 10% of the Groups total goodwill carrying value.
After translation using year end foreign exchange rates, these CGUs have 135.9m, 82.7m and 92.0m of goodwill respectively representing 40.9% of the total balance.
Within the remaining 448.0m there are no other amounts considered individually significant.
In 2007 the goodwill allocated to REMEC Defense and Space Inc and Conax Florida Corporation were considered individually significant.
The goodwill in these CGUs now represent 7.5% and 6.7% respectively of the 2008 goodwill carrying value.
SPARTA, Lansdale and M A-COM are all within the Cobham Defence Systems Division and they all operate primarily in the US defence market.
They are also all recent acquisitions and therefore specific financial plans have been used.
The recoverable amounts associated with these goodwill balances have been determined on a value in use basis.
A value in use test requires comparison of asset carrying values where some intangible asset values arising on acquisitions have been grossed up for hypothetical tax benefits, with pre-tax cash flows which exclude any tax benefit.
Furthermore, the value in use test ignores the related deferred tax liabilities which IFRS prevents from being included in any value in use calculation.
Key assumptions and sensitivities are as follows: The specific plans for the companies have been extrapolated in perpetuity using a long term US GDP growth rate of 3.5% and discounted to a present value using the Group assumption of 10.6%.
Where the specific plan is for less than five years, the growth rate has been adjusted to reflect a premium of 1% for the nature of the CGUs business, as supported by external research conducted on behalf of the Group.
After the initial five year period, the methodology described above has been used.
A key assumption in deriving the growth rate is that market demand in the products and services provided by SPARTA, Lansdale and M A-COM grow broadly in line with the underlying economic environment for the foreseeable future.
The growth rate would need to reduce by more than 0.4%, 0.1% and 1.6% respectively in order for the carrying value to be impaired.
If the associated deferred tax liability was included in the net assets being tested, the growth rate would need to reduce by more than 1.3%, 0.6% and 2.9%: Sensitivity analysis has determined that the discount rate of 10.6% is an influential assumption on the outcome of the recoverable amount calculation.
The recoverable amounts of SPARTA, Lansdale and M A-COM exceed the total carrying value of assets for the CGU by 13.8m, 0.8m and 71.9m respectively: the discount rate would need to increase to 11.0%, 10.7% and 12.2% for SPARTA, Lansdale and M A-COM in order for the carrying value to be impaired.
If the associated deferred tax liability was included in the net assets being tested, the discount rate would need to increase to 11.9%, 11.2% and 13.5%: Sensitivity analysis has also been performed on the operating cash flow projections.
Cash flows can be impacted by changes to sales projections, sales prices and direct costs.
In order for the carrying value of goodwill for SPARTA, Lansdale or M A-COM to be impaired, the expected cash flows for every year would need to reduce by 4.6%, 0.5% and 23.3% respectively.
If the associated deferred tax liability was included in the net assets being tested, the cash flows would need to reduce by 15.6%, 7.8% and 30.7%.
The cash flow projections within the value in use calculations include an allocation of central overheads.
If these were excluded then the discount rate would need to increase to 12.5%, 11.5% and 14.0% for SPARTA, Lansdale and M A-COM in order for the carrying value to be impaired.
If the associated deferred tax liability was included in the net assets being tested, the discount rate would need to increase to 13.7%, 12.1% and 15.0%.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions that would cause the carrying value of recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

All of the Groups investment properties are held under freehold interests and are valued under the cost model.
Property rental income earned by the Group from its investment properties amounted to 1.4m 2007: 1.3m, which is net of all direct costs associated with the leasing of the property, save for depreciation.
The buildings are leased to commercial users on operating leases with terms of between 3 and 25 years, commencing in 1998, 2004 and 2006.
The fair value of the investment property acquired with business combinations during the year was assessed to be 4.8m at the date of acquisition.
The Directors do not consider the fair value of this property to be significantly different at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of the other investment properties has been assessed to be 11.3m 2007: 13.8m.
This is based on estimated market prices provided by external valuers, Vail Williams LLP, as at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
One of these investment properties was sold in January 2009 realising a small profit.
Investments in joint ventures The Group has the following interests in joint ventures within the Cobham Aviation Services Division: a 45% of the voting share capital in Aviation Dfense Service SA, a company incorporated in France.
b 50% of the voting share capital in FB Heliservices Limited, a company incorporated in England.
c 50% of the voting share capital in FBS Limited, a company incorporated in England.
d 50% of the voting share capital in FB Leasing Limited, a company incorporated in England.
Notwithstanding the fact that the holding is 45%, governance structures for Aviation Dfense Service SA are such that the Group has joint control with its partner and therefore the investment is treated as a joint venture.

This allowance is reviewed by the Directors on a regular basis and further amounts are provided or released as considered necessary.
The amounts are generally determined based on factors which include ageing and known demand.
Subsequent events may give rise to these estimates being revised and, consequently, to reversal of amounts previously provided.

All trade receivables which are more than six months overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods and services, determined by reference to past default experience.
Amounts which are less than six months overdue are provided where recovery of the balance due is considered to be in doubt.
The Group has not experienced any material change in performance with respect to the recovery of trade receivables.
A significant proportion of its business is directly with government agencies or in respect of large government-funded military programmes, where risk is still considered low.
However, in light of the recent downturn in economic conditions and the additional exposure to the commercial marketplace, where risk of default may be impacted, additional impairment provisions of 7.5m have been made.

Cobham plc has committed to making further investments for this project as detailed in note 35.
Cash and cash equivalents Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents include the following for the purposes of the cash flow statement: m 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents per balance sheet 311.0 444.5 Bank overdrafts 6.6 1 2.5 Cash and cash equivalents per cash flow statement 304.4 432.0 Cash and cash equivalents include term deposits in Australia equivalent to 5.8m in total 2007: 4.9m.
These term deposits currently satisfy a requirement to provide security over the residual value of leased assets under an agreement which expires in 2020 but can be realised within three months under the terms of the agreements.
Also, in connection with the FSTA project, a small number of accounts have been established the balances of which are subject to charges in certain circumstances.
There were no balances on these accounts during 2008 or at the year end date.

A further 4.0m has also been provided in relation to certain legal claims.
Closing balances are analysed as: Contract Aircraft Contingent Warranty loss maintenance m consideration claims provisions provisions Other Total Current liabilities 21.3 5.1 4.5 3.8 40.5 75.2 Non-current liabilities 10.8 0.6 0.9 4.5 9.0 25.8 32.1 5.7 5.4 8.3 49.5 101.0 Contingent consideration Contingent consideration has been provided for where it is considered probable that the conditions applicable to the payment of contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions made by the Group in current and previous years will be met.
The amount provided is therefore the amount considered likely to be payable in the event of these conditions being met.
Arrangements of this nature vary, but may typically extend for up to five years and are discounted where payable after two years.
The provision at 31 December 2008 is stated after a discount of 0.1m 2007: 0.5m and the unwinding of the discount in the year resulted in a finance charge of 0.4m 2007: 0.4m.
Warranty claims The warranty provision represents managements best estimate of the Groups liability under warranties granted on products sold, based on past experience and industry averages for defective products.
It is anticipated that most of these costs will be incurred in the next two financial years.
Cobham plc 85 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued Contract loss provisions Contract loss provisions represent managements best estimate of the amount by which the expected benefits from certain specific contracts are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under those contracts.
The time frame within which such provisions will unwind varies by contract, but is generally within one year.
Aircraft maintenance provision Aircraft maintenance provisions are established in respect of significant periodic maintenance costs, where maintenance activity is required on leased operational aircraft or engines on a cycle greater than 12 months.
Costs are charged to the income statement on the basis of utilisation of the aircraft and are credited to the provision.
The provision is then utilised by absorbing the actual costs incurred in carrying out the maintenance activity.
Maintenance carried out on a cycle of 12 months or less is charged to the income statement as incurred.
When aircraft are leased, it is customary for the contract to contain specific conditions regarding the state of the aircraft on its return to the lessor at the end of the lease.
These conditions may relate to the number of operational hours to be available before a major maintenance check, the physical configuration of the aircraft or direct costs to be incurred by the lessee in the physical return of the aircraft to the lessor.
The estimated cost associated with fulfilling these requirements is charged to the income statement on an aircraft utilisation basis.
The provision is utilised on actual return of the aircraft or on incurring the expenditure required to return the aircraft to the state of maintenance required by the lease before return of the aircraft to the lessor.
Other provisions As noted above, other provisions include provisions recognised in connection with the Groups investment in the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft FSTA project, as well as legal claims and warranties and indemnities given on the disposals of the Countermeasures operations and the Fluid and Air group in 2005.
All amounts have been determined based on the Directors current estimates of likely outcomes.
Provisions relating to the Countermeasures and Fluid and Air disposals are likely to unwind over a period of more than one year but, due to the uncertainty over the timing and amounts, have not been discounted.
All other items are likely to be resolved within two years.

Deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes are analysed as follows: m 2008 2007 Deferred tax liabilities fall due as follows: Within one year 4.5 2.7 After one year 53.5 19.8 58.0 22.5 Deferred tax assets are recoverable as follows: Within one year 4.5 4.0 After one year 4.5 4.3 9.0 8.3 Without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances, deferred tax balances are as follows: Retirement Accelerated tax benefit Intangible m depreciation obligations assets Other Total Deferred tax assets 0.1 14.3 0.3 17.0 31.1 Deferred tax liabilities 10.6 55.7 13.8 80.1 At 31 December 2008 10.5 14.3 56.0 3.2 49.0 Deferred tax assets 0.4 10.4 25.6 36.4 Deferred tax liabilities 7.4 4.2 39.0 50.6 At 31 December 2007 7.0 10.4 4.2 13.4 14.2 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused capital losses of 72.9m 2007: 72.0m potentially available for offset against future profits in certain circumstances.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams.
These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 448.2m 2007: 305.4m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Groups share of the tax on temporary differences arising in connection with interests in joint ventures was 4.4m 2007: 4.8m.

During 2006 and 2007 the facility was extended by one year and now expires in 2012.
Interest is payable at the applicable LIBOR rate of the drawn currencies, plus margin.
As at 31 December 2008, 285.7m 2007: 226.4m had been drawn on this facility: In addition, two tranches of senior notes were issued in 2002, being US$55m maturing in 2009 with a 5.14% coupon and US$170m maturing in 2012 with a 5.58% coupon.
The following new facilities were agreed in 2008: A US$700m acquisition financing facility was agreed in January.
This matures in June 2009 and interest is payable at LIBOR plus margin.
During the year, US$50m was repaid and cancelled and, as at 31 December 2008 the remaining facility of US$650m was fully drawn: A 50m multi-currency credit facility was entered into in November for general corporate purposes.
This matures in November 2011, with extension to July 2012 at the option of the lender.
Interest is payable at LIBOR plus margin and, at 31 December 2008, 34.8m had been drawn on this facility: A US$75m credit agreement was signed in December.
This facility is available from 30 June 2009 to 31 December 2010 with interest payable at LIBOR plus margin.
From 31 December 2010 through to 31 December 2031 the loan attracts a fixed rate of interest, however the lender has a series of put options exercisable every three years throughout this period.
Additional financing facilities have been signed post year end: these are considered in note 38.
The respective agreements contain no provisions for charges over Group assets and include both financial and non-financial covenants.
The terms of the financial covenants are mainly driven from adjusted IFRS results.
There have been no breaches of the terms of loan agreements or defaults during the current or comparative periods.

During the year, the swaps which had been designated as fair value hedging instruments were terminated as described in note 27.
All cash flow hedges were fully effective and hence there is no ineffectiveness in cash flow hedges to be reported through the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness of the fair value hedge is reported through the income statement.
Most foreign exchange derivatives are not accounted for using hedge accounting and movements in fair values are shown separately in the income statement as part of operating profit.
The fair values of the Groups foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are established using valuation techniques, primarily discounting cash flows, based on assumptions that are supported by observable market prices or rates.

com Group financial statements Borrowings categorised as held at amortised cost include 161.6m 2007: 114.3m in respect of senior notes which were previously held at fair value for the purposes of fair value hedge accounting.
During April 2008, the interest rate swap hedging instruments in the fair value hedges were sold and the debt was fair valued at this time at 6.4m above the nominal value.
The senior notes have two maturity dates, with a nominal value of 38.3m maturing in October 2009 and 118.2m maturing in October 2012.
The differences between the nominal values and fair values on termination of the fair value hedges was 0.8m and 5.6m respectively, these are being amortised from cessation of the hedges through to the respective maturities of the senior notes.
As a result of the termination of the fair value hedges the effective interest rate on the notes maturing in October 2009 is 3.7% and on the notes maturing in October 2012 is 4.4%.
As at 31 December 2008, the fair values of the senior notes maturing in October 2009 and October 2012 were 39.1m and 130.0m respectively.
The maximum exposure to credit risk on the senior notes is considered to be their carrying value of US$225m 161.6m, 2007: 114.3m.
The change in the fair value of the senior notes is considered to relate entirely to changes in market conditions and is not impacted by changes in credit risk.
The difference between the carrying amount of the senior notes and the amount which the Group is contractually required to pay on maturity is 5.1m 2007: 1.3m.
The Groups investment in the FSTA companies described in note 19e is classified as available for sale.
The Group does not hold any financial assets which would be classified as held to maturity.
The total interest income and expense for financial assets and liabilities not held at fair value through profit or loss is as follows: m 2008 2007 Interest income 28.4 20.9 Interest expense 37.8 1 1.

Financial instruments and risk management The Groups multi-national operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity risk and interest rates.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt, and other instruments, including interest rate swaps.
Financial instruments The Group finances its operations primarily through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.
Where it does use financial instruments these are mainly put in place to manage the currency financing risks arising from normal operations, further details of which are given in note 26 and interest rates.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk and interest rate risk are the most significant exposures for the Group for which financial instruments are employed as mitigation.
The Group is exposed to other risks such as liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The policies have remained unchanged throughout the year.
Foreign currency risk The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further investments in other European countries, Australia and Canada.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk.
Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Groups overseas net assets and, where applicable, are designated as net investment hedges.
Cobham plc 91 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued The Group also has transactional currency exposures which arise when an operating unit makes sales and purchases in currencies other than its own functional currency.
The Group undertakes a formal process to actively manage and mitigate this exposure through a combination of minimising trading in non-functional currencies, matching non-functional currency revenues with non-functional currency costs and through the use of forward contracts.
Currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by Cobham plc management.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities are as follows: 2008 2007 million US$ AUS$ US$ AUS$ Monetary assets 271.4 81.9 50.0 132.0 69.2 52.4 Monetary liabilities 1,070.0 107.8 88.5 329.6 101.4 82.5 The following borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts match exposures arising from currency denominated net assets: m 2008 2007 US dollar borrowings 838.1 246.2 US dollar foreign exchange contracts 1 77.4 Euro borrowings 32.9 45.4 The sterling US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as the Group is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which non US based subsidiaries expect to receive from their normal business activities, and the proportion of the Group based in the US.
In addition to the longer term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts.
It is the Groups current belief that the net dollar receipts from its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitment.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars outstanding as at 31 December: US$ amount million Average US$: exchange rate 2008 2007 2008 2007 Expiring within one year 140.0 131.0 1.82 1.93 Expiring within one to two years 70.2 16.2 1.53 1.67 Expiring after two years 75.7 51.3 1.59 1.71 285.9 198.5 1.68 1.84 The latest date for expiry of US dollar forward foreign currency contracts is September 2014.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a change in sterling against the respective foreign currencies.
The sensitivities below represent managements assessment of the possible changes in foreign exchange rates based on experience over the previous five years.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the assumption that the change is effective throughout the financial year.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and equity where sterling weakens against the respective currency.
A strengthening of sterling would have the equal but opposite effect on the basis that all other variables remain constant.

92 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 www.
com Group financial statements In order to provide comparable information, sensitivity has also been assessed based on a 10% change in sterling against the respective foreign currency, as follows: 2008 2007 m Sensitivity Profit loss Equity Sensitivity Profit loss Equity US dollars 10% 47.7 47.7 10% 7.
1 Euros 10% 2.3 2.3 10% 4.8 4.8 Australian dollars 10% 4.0 4.0 10% 3.6 3.6 The Groups sensitivity to foreign currency has increased during the current period primarily as a result of increased US based operations through acquisition, funded by US dollar borrowings during the year.
Interest rate risk The Group has various long and short term borrowings, principally in US dollars, euros and Australian dollars at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
The Group continually monitors its exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs.
Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions and to use interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk.
The Group has fixed rate borrowings under senior notes totalling 156.5m at 31 December 2008 2007: 113.0m, these mature in 2009 38.3m and 2012 118.2m.
On issuance in 2002, these were swapped into floating rates and the Group applied hedge accounting, designating the swap as a fair value hedge see note 26.
The swap contracts were satisfied during 2008 as shown in notes 26 and 27.
All floating rate borrowings have regular repricing dates.
Interest rate swaps which mitigate the exposure arising on floating rate debt are all designated as cash flow hedges and are as follows: Period of swap contract Fixed rate From To Currency value 2008 m 2007 m US dollar bank loans 4.48% January 2006 June 2010 US$260.0m 180.8 130.6 US dollar bank loans 3.49% March 2008 March 2013 US$278.0m 193.4 US dollar bank loans 3.61% August 2008 August 2013 US$422.0m 293.5 Australian dollar bank loans 6.30% May 2006 January 2020 AUS$99.0m 48.1 46.8 Australian dollar bank loans 6.40% January 2007 January 2020 AUS$14.8m 7.2 2.8 During the year the Group acquired a forward starting interest rate swap for US$260.0m which commences in June 2010.
It is at a fixed rate of 3.22% and expires in June 2013.
The fair value of these cash flow hedge instruments is as detailed in note 26.
Surplus funds are placed on short term deposit.
These deposits have floating rates of interest, and thus there is some modest exposure to interest rates on these deposits.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a change of 1.0% in interest rates throughout the year, with all other variables, including foreign currency exchange rates, held constant.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and equity where interest rates rise.
A fall in interest rates would have the equal but opposite effect on the basis that all other variables remain constant.

For short term working capital purposes in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall Group arrangement.
In the US a central treasury function is maintained which all US subsidiaries use.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the Groups policy throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long term borrowings with their lenders.
Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities and the use of the Groups revolving credit facility.
In addition, it is the Groups policy to maintain undrawn committed borrowing facilities in various currencies in order to provide flexibility in the management of the Groups liquidity.

Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with satisfactory credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group further limits risk in this area by setting a maximum level for deposits or overdrafts with any one counterparty.
These facilities are reviewed every six months or more often if there is an indication that the credit rating of any of the banks falls below a Moodys Aa3 rating.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Customers are typically large global companies or government agencies with long term trading relationships.
The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
Existing customer accounts are also monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where necessary to minimise any credit risk.
The Directors therefore believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for impaired receivables.
Group management monitor the ageing of receivables which are more than one month overdue and debtor days on a regular basis.
At 31 December 2008, 7.6% 2007: 8.9% of gross trade receivables were overdue by one month or more.
94 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 www.
com Group financial statements The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2008 is the fair value of each class of receivable as disclosed in note 19. Letters of credit are the only collateral held as security against trade receivables.
These are obtained in a limited number of cases in accordance with good business practice.
The Group has pledged assets only in respect of finance leases and bank accounts as disclosed in notes 15 and 20.
No assets have been pledged in respect of any of the Groups primary borrowing facilities or other financial liabilities.
In the UK and the USA, the Group has master netting arrangements in respect of bank balances.
In the normal course of business these bank accounts are settled on a net basis within each currency and as such are presented net in the financial statements.
In the event of an automatic enforcement event the bank balances are automatically set off against each other to achieve a net position.
Capital risk management Group policy is to maintain a strong capital base, defined as total shareholders equity, excluding minority interests, totalling 848.2m at 31 December 2008 2007: 803.7m, so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Within this overall policy, the Group seeks to maintain an optimum capital structure by a mixture of debt and retained earnings.
Funding needs are reviewed periodically and also each time a significant acquisition is made.
A number of factors are considered which include the net debt EBITDA ratio, future funding needs usually potential acquisitions, proposed dividend levels and Group banking arrangements.
This policy has been reviewed by the Board on a regular basis during the year and, given the current economic climate, continues to be considered appropriate.
Primary sources of funding for the Group are the bank and private placement markets and typically the Group borrows US dollars to fund acquisitions in the USA.
As noted above, the Group maintains a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate arrangements and within the overall net cash will have sterling deposits and borrowings in overseas currencies such as US dollars, euros and Australian dollars funding overseas operations.

These included a number of options held by senior management which, under the terms of the agreement, vested immediately at the date of acquisition: Payments are to be made for unvested options outstanding at the date of acquisition which have been replaced by cash settled rights as detailed in note 11.
US$20m of the cost of these awards has been allocated to contingent consideration, based on the proportion of the vesting period completed prior to the acquisition and the respective fair values of the original and replacement awards at that date.
Vesting and hence payment of the contingent consideration is conditional only upon the continued employment of the employees to the original vesting date: Further payments were also to be made to employees in lieu of bonus arrangements contingent upon the continued employment of the employees to the final payment date of August 2009.
US$6m of the total amount to be paid has been allocated to contingent consideration: The total amount allocated to the post-acquisition period is US$24m of which US$10.1m 5.5m has been charged to the income statement during 2008.
This is included within acquisition related adjustments and excluded from underlying earnings as described in note 7.

com Group financial statements The losses after tax since the date of acquisition shown above include the impacts of amortisation of intangible assets and internal finance costs which are included within the results of the acquired business for management purposes.
If these acquisitions had taken effect on 1 January 2008, it is estimated that Group total revenues would have been 1,676.6m and profit after tax 109.7m.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the results had the operations been acquired at the start of the year, nor of future results of the combined operations.
A summary of the total book and fair values of the acquisitions which took place during 2008 is as follows: m Book value prior to acquisition Fair value Non-current assets Intangibles 2.8 289.3 Property, plant and equipment 27.4 35.1 Investment properties 4.8 4.8 Current assets Inventories 34.0 42.0 Trade receivables 66.3 60.4 Other receivables 5.3 5.5 Corporation tax 5.9 Bank and cash balances 33.8 33.8 Current liabilities Trade payables 37.6 38.0 Other liabilities 10.2 12.1 Provisions 5.8 5.7 Corporation tax 0.2 1.9 Non-current liabilities Deferred tax liability 0.3 51.3 Held for sale 36.3 36.3 Net assets acquired 157.2 404.1 Goodwill 253.7 Total consideration 657.8 Cobham plc 99 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued This is analysed for each acquisition as follows: S-TEC, MMI and GMS Lansdale SPARTA M A-COM Book value prior Book value prior Book value prior Book value prior m to acquisition Fair value to acquisition Fair value to acquisition Fair value to acquisition Fair value Non-current assets Intangibles 2.2 39.5 46.6 0.6 119.2 84.0 Property, plant and equipment 1.6 1.6 7.4 9.6 5.2 5.2 13.2 18.7 Investment properties 4.8 4.8 Current assets Inventories 5.3 5.9 6.0 4.9 0.1 1.2 22.6 30.0 Trade receivables 6.3 4.9 2.3 2.3 28.6 27.3 29.1 25.9 Other receivables 0.7 0.7 3.6 4.6 1.2 Corporation tax 5.9 Bank and cash balances 0.6 0.6 32.9 32.9 0.3 0.3 Current liabilities Trade payables 2.9 2.9 21.8 21.8 12.9 13.3 Other liabilities 1.6 1.8 2.8 2.8 5.8 7.5 Provisions 0.3 0.6 5.5 5.1 Corporation tax 0.3 0.2 1.6 Non-current liabilities Deferred tax liability 11.3 0.3 38.5 1.5 Held for sale 36.3 36.3 Net assets acquired 11.9 36.3 15.7 63.4 42.9 130.6 86.7 173.8 Goodwill 15.9 60.4 99.4 78.0 Total consideration 52.2 123.8 230.0 251.8 As at 31 December 2008, fair values of assets and liabilities acquired for M A-COM are provisional and subject to potential subsequent adjustment.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess of the total cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Goodwill represents the premium paid in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised.
Adjustments from book value to fair value include adjustments arising from the application of Group accounting policies, the recognition of intangible assets under IFRS3 Business Combinations and fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment and inventories.
Discontinued operations m 2008 2007 Profit on disposal 2.9 5.8 No businesses were sold or classified as discontinued during the current or prior year and there were no trading profits arising from discontinued operations during 2008 or 2007.
A profit on disposal of 2.9m arose in 2008 relating to the disposal of the Fluid and Air group which was sold in 2005.
In 2007, contingent consideration totalling 5.8m was received in relation to the disposal of Wallop Defence Systems Limited which was sold in 2006.
No tax liability arises in respect of these profits.
Consistent with the treatment previously adopted for these businesses, these profits are treated as the results of discontinued operations.
Basic earnings per share from discontinued operations is 0.26p per share 2007: 0.51p per share and diluted earnings per share for the discontinued operations is 0.26p per share 2007: 0.51p per share, based on the profit for the year from discontinued operations of 2.9m 2007: 5.8m and the share data in note 6 for both basic and diluted earnings per share.

com Group financial statements M A-COM Technology Solutions Inc, part of the M A-COM business, was acquired with a view to immediate resale and its assets and liabilities are held at fair value less costs to sell.
Accordingly, it has been classified as an investment held for sale at 31 December 2008 and its results have not been included in the results of the consolidated Group.
Operating lease arrangements At the balance sheet date the Group had outstanding commitments for minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable operating leases as follows: m 2008 2007 Within one year 31.5 15.1 Between one and five years 85.5 42.8 After five years 118.6 93.1 235.6 151.0 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office and operational properties, and operational aircraft used in its service businesses.
Contingent liabilities As at 31 December 2008, the parent company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business entered into for, or on behalf of, certain Group undertakings.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the Group consolidated financial statements or within those of the relevant subsidiary.
As the conditions of the above guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no contingent liability provision has been made at the year end.
Cobham plc has also committed, in connection with the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project, to invest 6.0m in the equity share capital of three companies and to provide additional funding of 18.1m in the form of redeemable loan notes by March 2013 at the latest.
In addition, a number of guarantees and letters of credit have been provided to secure the funding of this project.
6.0m has been provided in connection with these guarantees as at 31 December 2008 as shown in note 22.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to numerous legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Even though one claim is larger than is typical, the Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
Commitments At 31 December 2008, the Group had commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment of 10.9m 2007: 17.1m of which a significant proportion relates to aircraft for the Australian Sentinel contract.
