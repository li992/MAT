Market value represents the figure that would appear in a hypothetical contract of sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to market rent, taking into account forecast growth rates and yields based on known transactions for similar properties and likely incentives offered to tenants.
There are certain restrictions on the realisability of investment property when a credit facility is in place.
In most circumstances the group can realise up to 50% without restriction providing the group continues to manage the asset.
Realising an amount in excess of this would trigger a change of control and mandatory repayment of the facility.
