The amendment to IAS 23 generally eliminates the option to expense borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as incurred, and instead requires the capitalisation of such borrowing costs as part of the cost of specific assets.
The group is currently assessing the impact of the amendment on the results and net assets of the group.
The amendment to IAS 38 clarifies the accounting for advertising expenditure.
The group is currently assessing the impact this amendment to the standard would have on the results and net assets of the group.
IFRS 3 Revised continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations with some significant changes, particularly in respect of the measurement of contingent payments, the calculation of goodwill and the treatment of transaction costs.
These changes apply to business combinations occurring from 1 July 2009.
IFRS 8 contains requirements for the disclosure of information about an entitys operating segments and also about the entitys products and services, the geographical areas in which it operates, and its major customers.
The standard is concerned only with disclosure and replaces IAS 14 Segment reporting.
The group is currently assessing the impact this standard would have on the presentation of its consolidated results.
IFRIC 14 provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised as an asset.
It also explains how the post employment benefit asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding requirement.
It is not expected that the interpretation would have a material impact on the results or net assets of the group.
The group does not currently believe the adoption of the remaining standards or interpretations would have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the group.
With the exception of IAS 1 Revised and IFRS 8, none of the above standards and interpretations not yet adopted by Diageo have been endorsed or adopted for use in the European Union.
