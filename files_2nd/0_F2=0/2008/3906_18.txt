indb 88 5 11 08 11:24:44 Statement of Accounting Policies Except as stated below, the following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost accounting rules, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards UK GAAP.
As permitted by S230 3 of the Companies Act 1985, the Companys profit and loss account and statement of total recognisable gains and losses has not been presented.
The Connaught plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2008 contain a consolidated cash flow statement.
Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 1 Revised 1996 Cash Flow Statements not to present its own cash flow statement.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions in FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures not to disclose transactions with other Group members.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Depreciation is provided by the Company to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Buildings 2% straight line per annum Leasehold improvements Charged over life of lease Motor vehicles 25% straight line per annum Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 20% straight line per annum Plant and machinery 20% straight line per annum Computer equipment 25% straight line per annum Management software packages Charged over estimated life of package Leases Where the Company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors.
Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases and the rental charges are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Pension costs The Company operates defined contribution and Group personal pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The amounts charged against profits represent the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Tax including deferred tax The tax expense represents the sum of current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
Current tax expense is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Full provision on an undiscounted basis is made for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in the respective tax computations.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are more likely than not to be recovered in the short term.

indb 89 5 11 08 11:24:44 Statement of Accounting Policies continued Dividends Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders, while interim dividends are recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid.
Investments held as fixed assets Investments held as fixed assets comprise the Companys investment in subsidiaries and are shown at initial cost being the fair value of the consideration paid including amounts attributable to transaction costs less any provision for impairment reviewed on an individual basis if events or circumstances dictate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
Share-based payment The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and until 1 September 2006 operated an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn share option scheme open to eligible employees which allows the purchase of shares at a discount.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model as set out on page 45.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Where relevant, the value of the option has also been adjusted to take account of market conditions applicable to the option.
