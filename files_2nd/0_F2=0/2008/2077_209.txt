b Shares issued on exercise of BHP Billitons employee share ownership plans include shares purchased on-market.
c There are two active Group employee ownership plans in BHP Billiton: a short-term incentive plan and a long-term incentive plan.
Short-term incentives under the Group Incentive Scheme GIS are split equally between a cash award being a percentage of base salary and a grant of Deferred Shares and or Options.
Deferred Shares and or Options are subject to a two-year vesting period before they can be exercised.
If, during that period, an individual resigns without the Remuneration Committees consent, or is dismissed for cause, their entitlement is forfeited.
The GIS incentivises the executives to achieve annual goals linked to the business strategy, budget and personal objectives.
Measures are set to reflect the critical KPIs of the Group in a combination of financial and non-financial areas.
At the end of each year, the performance level achieved against each KPI is measured and awards are calculated and paid according to the level of performance.
Long-term incentives, in the form of Performance Shares, are awarded annually under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The Performance Hurdle applicable to the awards granted requires BHP Billitons Total Shareholder Return TSR over a five-year performance period to be greater than the weighted average TSR of a peer group of companies.
To the extent that the Performance Hurdle is not achieved, awards are forfeited.
For all Performance Shares to vest, BHP Billitons TSR must exceed the weighted average TSR of the Index by a specified percentage, determined each year by the Committee.
Since the establishment of the LTIP in 2004, this percentage has been set each year at 5.5 per cent.
For performance between the weighted average TSR of the Index and 5.5 per cent per annum above the Index, vesting occurs on a sliding scale.
Participants in the GIS and the LTIP are eligible to receive a payment equal to the dividend amount that would have been earned on the underlying shares represented by the Deferred Shares, Options and Performance Shares awarded to those participants the Dividend Equivalent Payment.
The Dividend Equivalent Payment is made to the participants once the underlying shares are issued or transferred to them.
No Dividend Equivalent Payment is made in respect of Deferred Shares, Options and Performance Shares that lapse.
d In respect of employee share awards, the Group utilises the following trusts: i The Billiton Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust the Trust is a discretionary trust for the benefit of all employees of BHP Billiton Plc and its subsidiaries.
The trustee is an independent company, resident in Jersey.

The ordinary shares may be acquired by purchase in the market or by subscription at not less than nominal value.
ii The BHP Performance Share Plan Trust PSP Trust is a discretionary trust established to distribute shares under selected BHP Billiton Limited employee share plan schemes.
The trustee of the trust is BHP Billiton Employee Plan Pty Ltd, an Australian company.
The trust uses funds provided by BHP Billiton Limited and or its subsidiaries to acquire shares on market to satisfy exercises made under the LTIP, GIS, and PSP.
iii The BHP Billiton Limited Executive Incentive Schemes Trust BEIS Trust is a discretionary trust established for the purposes of holding shares in BHP Billiton Limited to satisfy exercises made under the LTIP, GIS and other employee share schemes operated by BHP Billiton Limited from time to time.
