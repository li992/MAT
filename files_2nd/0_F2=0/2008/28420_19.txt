Financial statements Parent company Notes on the parent company financial statements 1 Nature of operations Prudential plc the Company is a parent holding company.
The Company together with its subsidiaries collectively, the Group is an international financial services group with its principal operations in the UK, the US and Asia.
The Group operates in the UK through its subsidiaries, primarily The Prudential Assurance Company Limited, Prudential Annuities Limited, Prudential Retirement Income Limited and M&G Investment Management Limited.
In the US, the Groups principal subsidiary is Jackson National Life Insurance Company.
In Asia, the Groups main operations are in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan.
On 20 February 2009, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement subject to regulatory approval to transfer the assets and liabilities of its agency distribution business and its agency force in Taiwan to China Life Insurance Company Ltd of Taiwan.
Further details are set out in note I10 Post Balance Sheet Events of the Group financial statements.
The Company is responsible for the financing of each of its subsidiaries.
2 Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Company, which comprise the balance sheet and related notes, are prepared in accordance with Section 226 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985, which apply to companies generally.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP, including Financial Reporting Standards FRS and Statements of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP.
The Company has not prepared a cash flow statement on the basis that its cash flow is included within the cash flow statement in the consolidated financial statements.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the Group or investees of the Group.
In addition, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, from the requirements of this standard on the basis that the Companys results are included in the publicly available consolidated financial statements of the Group that include disclosures that comply with IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which is equivalent to FRS 29.
UITF 44, Group and Treasury Share Transactions which is an interpretation of FRS 20, Share-based Payment became effective in 2008.
Where a parent company grants the options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary, and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements, UITF 44 requires the subsidiary to record a compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity as a capital contribution equal to the value of the share-based payment in accordance with FRS 20.
Consequently, in the financial statements of the parent company, an increase in the investment in the subsidiary is recorded for the value of the share options and awards granted to the employees of the subsidiary.
As a result of the adoption of UITF 44, the Company has recognised an addition to investment in subsidiary undertakings of the aggregate amount of the contributions for equity instruments it granted, primarily under the Save As You Earn SAYE plan, subsequent to 7 November 2002.
As at 31 December 2008, the addition to investment in subsidiary undertakings of the Company was 28 million with a corresponding credit to equity for the same amount.
The 2007 comparatives have also been adjusted accordingly for the adoption of UITF 44 with an addition to investment in subsidiary undertakings of 19 million and a corresponding credit to equity.
There is no impact on the profit or loss of the Company.
In October 2008, the Accounting Standards Board ASB approved the Amendments to FRS 26 IAS 39 and FRS 29 IFRS 7 : Reclassification of Financial Assets that permit the reclassification of certain held for trading and available-for-sale financial assets into the loans and receivables category carried at amortised cost if specific conditions are met and additional disclosures are made regarding any assets so reclassified.
The adoption of these amendments to FRS 26 and FRS 29 did not have an impact on the balance sheet or profit and loss account of the Company as the Company has not made any such reclassification of financial assets as permitted by the amendments.
3 Significant accounting policies Shares in subsidiary undertakings Shares in subsidiary undertakings are shown at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value.
Loans to subsidiary undertakings Loans to subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost, less provisions.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce or manage interest rate and currency exposures.
The Companys policy is that amounts at risk through derivative transactions are covered by cash or by corresponding assets.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the profit and loss account.
Under FRS 26, hedge accounting is permissible only if certain criteria are met regarding the establishment of documentation and continued measurement of hedge effectiveness.
For derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges, the movements in the fair value are recorded in the profit and loss account with the accompanying change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
307 Notes on the parent company financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds, net of transaction costs, is amortised through the profit and loss account to the date of maturity.
Dividends Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared.
Dividends declared after the balance sheet date in respect of the prior reporting period are treated as a non-adjusting event.
Where scrip dividends are issued, the value of such shares, measured as the amount of the cash dividend alternative, is credited to reserves and the amount in excess of the nominal value of the shares issued is transferred from the share premium account to retained profit.
Share premium The difference between the proceeds received on issue of shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Foreign currency translation Foreign currency borrowings that have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated at year end exchange rates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded within the profit and loss account for the year.
Other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are also converted at year end exchange rates with the related foreign currency exchange gains or losses reflected in the profit and loss account for the year.
Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year.
To the extent that losses of an individual UK company are not offset in any one year, they can be carried back for one year or carried forward indefinitely to be offset against profits arising from the same company.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of FRS 19.
The Company has chosen not to apply the option available of recognising such assets and liabilities on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money.
Except as set out in FRS 19, deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The Groups UK subsidiaries each file separate tax returns.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, where one domestic UK company is a 75 per cent owned subsidiary of another UK company or both are 75 per cent owned subsidiaries of a common parent, the companies are considered to be within the same UK tax group.
For companies within the same tax group, trading profits and losses arising in the same accounting period may be offset for the purposes of determining current and deferred taxes.
Pensions The Company assumes a portion of the pension surplus or deficit of the Groups largest pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS and applied the requirements of FRS 17 as amended in December 2006 to its interest in the PSPS surplus or deficit.
Further details are disclosed in note 8.
A pension surplus or deficit is recorded as the difference between the present value of the scheme liabilities and the fair value of the scheme assets.
The Companys share of pension surplus is recognised to the extent that the Company was able to recover a surplus either through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes of the Prudential Group are subject to a full triennial actuarial valuation using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a high quality corporate bond rate, adjusted to allow for the difference in duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities where appropriate, to determine its present value.
These calculations are performed by independent actuaries.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel and the unwind of the discount on liabilities at the start of the period, gains and losses on settlements and curtailments, less the expected investment return on the scheme assets at the start of the period, is recognised in the profit and loss account.
To the extent that part or all of the Companys interest in the pension surplus is not recognised as an asset, the unrecognised surplus is initially applied to extinguish any past service costs, losses on settlements or curtailments that would otherwise be included in the profit and loss account.
Next, the expected investment return on the schemes assets is restricted so that it does not exceed the total of the current service cost, interest cost and any increase in the recoverable surplus.
Any further adjustment for the unrecognised surplus is treated as an actuarial gain or loss.
Actuarial gains and losses as a result of the changes in assumptions, the difference between actual and expected investment return on scheme assets and experience variances are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Actuarial gains and losses also include adjustment for unrecognised pension surplus as described above.
308 Prudential plc Annual Report 2008 Financial statements Parent company Share-based payments The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a SAYE plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
The share-based payment plans operated by the Group are mainly equity-settled plans with a few cash-settled plans.
Following the adoption of UITF 44, where the Company, as the parent company, grants the options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary, and such share-based payment is accounted for as equity-settled in the Group financial statements, the Company records an increase in the investment in the subsidiary undertakings for the value of the share options and awards granted with a corresponding credit entry recognised directly in equity.
The value of the share options and awards granted is based upon the fair value of the options and awards at the grant date, the vesting period and the vesting conditions.

These have been swapped into borrowings of 14 million with interest payable at three month Libor plus 1.2 per cent.
iii Interest on the US$1,000 million 6.5 per cent borrowings was swapped into floating rate payments at three month US$Libor plus 0.80 per cent.
In January 2009, this swap was cancelled.
iv The US$250 million 6.75 per cent borrowings and the US$300 million 6.5 per cent borrowings can be converted, in whole or in part, at the Companys option and subject to certain conditions, on any interest payment date falling on or after 23 March 2010 and 23 March 2011 respectively, into one or more series of Prudential preference shares.
v Interest on the US$300 million 6.5 per cent borrowings was swapped into floating rate payments at three month US$Libor plus 0.0225 per cent.
In January 2008, this was swapped back into fixed rate payments at 6.5 per cent.
vi Hedge accounting is applied at both the Group consolidated level and Company level.
Due to different dates for commencement of this accounting treatment, the hedge values differ between these two levels.
vii These borrowings support a short-term fixed income securities programme.
viii In October 2008, the Company issued 200 million Floating Rate Notes, maturing in April 2009.
These were wholly subscribed to by a Group subsidiary and accordingly have been eliminated on consolidation in the Group financial statements.
ix The interests of the holders of the Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Capital Securities are subordinate to the entitlements of other creditors of the Company.

Subsequent to the year end, in January 2009, the interest rate swap to hedge the interest exposure on the US$1,000 million 6.5 per cent perpetual subordinated capital securities was cancelled.
The derivative financial instruments were valued internally using standard market practices.
In accordance with the Companys risk management framework, all internally generated valuations are subject to independent assessment against external counterparties valuations.
8 Pension scheme financial position The majority of UK Prudential staff are members of the Groups pension schemes.
The largest scheme is the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS which is primarily a closed defined benefit scheme.
At 31 December 2008, on the FRS 17, Retirement Benefits basis of valuation, the underlying pension liabilities of PSPS accounted for 87 per cent 2007: 87 per cent of the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
For the purpose of preparing consolidated financial statements, the Group applies IFRS basis accounting including IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
However, the individual accounts of the Company continue to follow UK GAAP.
In 2006, the Company early adopted the amendment to FRS 17 issued in December 2006 which aligned the FRS 17 disclosures with IAS 19.
In 2008, the Group adopted IFRIC 14, an interpretation guidance to IAS 19 with the effect of derecognising the Groups interest in PSPS surplus and recognising an additional liability for the deficit funding for PSPS to 5 April 2010 in the Group financial statements.
Further details are described in note I1 Staff and pension plans of the notes on the financial statements of the Group.
At 31 December 2005, the allocation of surpluses and deficits attaching to PSPS between the Company and the unallocated surplus of the Prudential Assurance Companys PAC with-profits funds was apportioned in the ratio 30 70 between the Company and the PAC with-profits fund following detailed consideration of the sourcing of previous contributions.
This ratio was applied to the base deficit position at 1 January 2006 and for the purpose of determining the allocation of the movements in that position up to 31 December 2008.
The FRS 17 service charge and ongoing employer contributions are allocated by reference to the cost allocation for current activity.
Defined benefit schemes are generally required to be subject to full actuarial valuation every three years to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes having regard to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
PSPS was last actuarially valued as at 5 April 2005 using the projected unit method.
This valuation demonstrated the scheme to be 94 per cent funded, with a shortfall of actuarially determined assets to liabilities of six per cent, representing a deficit of 243 million.
As a result, changes to the basis of funding for the scheme from 2006 onwards were made.
Deficit funding amounts designed to eliminate the actuarial deficit over a 10-year period have been and are being made.
Based on this valuation, total contributions to the scheme for deficit funding and employer contributions for ongoing service for current employees are expected to be of the order of 70 to 75 million per annum subject to a reassessment when the subsequent valuation is completed.
In 2008, total contributions for the year, including expenses and augmentations, were 79 million 2007: 82 million.
The PSPS valuation as at 5 April 2008 is currently being finalised.
311 Notes on the parent company financial statements continued 8 Pension scheme financial position continued Using external actuarial advice provided by the professionally qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt Partners, for the valuation of PSPS, the most recent full valuations have been updated to 31 December 2008 applying the principles prescribed by FRS 17.
The key assumptions adopted were: 2008 % 2007 % Rate of inflation 3.0 3.3 Rate of increase in salaries 5.0 5.3 Rate of increase in pension payments for inflation: Guaranteed maximum 5% 3.0 3.3 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 2.5 Discretionary 2.5 2.5 Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 6.1 5.9 Long-term expected rate of return Prospectively for 2009 % 2008 % 2007 % Equities 6.8 7.5 7.5 Bonds 4.8 5.5 4.9 Properties 6.05 6.75 6.8 Other assets 2.0 5.5 5.0 Weighted average long-term expected rate of return 4.5 6.2 5.9 The long-term expected rates of return have been determined after applying due consideration to the requirements of paragraph 54 of FRS 17, in particular, taking account of the values of the assets.
Further details on the PSPS scheme, including mortality assumptions, are shown in note I1 Staff and pension plans of the notes on the financial statements of the Group.

The experience gains on scheme liabilities in 2008 of a gain of 127 million relate mainly to the true-up reflecting improvements in data consequent upon the ongoing triennial valuation of PSPS.
The actuarial gains losses attributable to the Company are net of the apportionment to the PAC with-profits funds and correspond to the surplus deficit recognised on the balance sheet of the Company.
In 2008, the actuarial losses attributable to the Company included an amount of 164 million for the unrecognised portion of surplus which has not been deducted from the pension credit charge.
The actuarial losses before tax of 143 million 2007: gains of 91 million attributable to the Company net of related tax are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Cumulative actuarial gains as at 31 December 2008 amount to 91 million 2007: 234 million.
The 2005 actuarial losses attributable to the Company reflected the changed estimate of allocation in the deficit of PSPS from a ratio of 20 80 between the Company and the PAC with-profits fund prior to 2005 to a ratio of 30 70 from 2005 onwards.
Total employer contributions expected to be paid into the PSPS defined benefit scheme for the year ending 31 December 2009 amount to 78 million, subject to a reassessment when the valuation as at 5 April 2008 is completed.
