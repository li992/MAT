136 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 Borrowings continued Taking into account the Groups interest rate swap and cap contracts, the effective interest rates of its borrowings are as follows: 31 March 2008 2007 2,394,000 6.5% cumulative preference shares of 1 each 6.5% 6.5% Industrial Revenue Bonds US$92,000,000 2.2% 3.7% 6.5% Guaranteed Notes 2012 200,000,000 5.3% 5.5% 5.0% Guaranteed Notes 2014 US$500,000,000 4.9% 4.9% 6.125% Guaranteed Notes 2011 US$300,000,000 5.0% 5.9% 6.625% Guaranteed Notes 2016 US$250,000,000 6.0% 6.4% Short-term loans and overdrafts Current short-term loans mature within the next 12 months and overdrafts are repayable on demand.
Both short-term loans and bank overdrafts are arranged at floating rates of interest and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Credit facilities and arrangements The Group has undrawn committed multi-currency facilities of 438 million 2007 236 million, of which 55 million matures in September 2009 and 383 million matures in October 2012.
These facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
The facilities may only be withdrawn in the event of specified events of default.
In addition, the Group has substantial uncommitted facilities.
At 31 March 2007, a US subsidiary had outstanding external borrowings of US$800 million, the principal amount of which was guaranteed by another Group company by way of credit-linked deposits with a bank of US$680 million and pledged bank securities of US$120 million.
The guarantees resulted in these borrowings being, in substance, non-recourse to the Group as to principal in the event of default and accordingly the borrowings and deposits were offset at that date.
This arrangement ceased during the year ended 31 March 2008.
