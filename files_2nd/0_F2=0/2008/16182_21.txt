Notes to the Companys financial statements for the 14-month period ended 30 September 2008 A.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and under the historical cost convention.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
In September 2007 the Company changed its accounting reference date from 31 July to 30 September and therefore draws up accounts for the 14-month period ended 30 September 2008.
The comparative figures cover the period from incorporation 29 January 2007 to 31 July 2007.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The profit after tax included in the financial statements of TUI Travel PLC, determined in accordance with the Act, was 376.3m 2007: nil.
Under Financial Reporting Standard No 1 revised, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement as its cash flows are included within the published consolidated statement of cash flows of TUI Travel PLC.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained within FRS 8 and has not therefore disclosed transactions or balances with entities which form part of its Group.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained within FRS 29 and has not provided the required financial instruments disclosure on the basis that the Groups consolidated financial statements include consolidated IFRS 7 disclosures which are compliant with the requirements of FRS 29.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values were determined.
Leases Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in creditors.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Operating lease income is recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Investments In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Companys profit and loss account.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any differences between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Classification of financial instruments issued Financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following conditions: they include no contractual obligation upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company and: where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
TUI Travel PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2008 125 Financial Statements Notes to the Companys financial statements for the 14-month period ended 30 September 2008 continued Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Share-based payment The Company operates share-based payment schemes for the employees of its subsidiaries.
The fair value of options granted to employees of the Company is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
However, as the Company has no employees, there is no recognition of an employee expense nor the corresponding increase in equity.
Rather the Company grants awards of its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries and as such the Company recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiaries financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and is spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the awards.
Calculating the fair value takes into account various factors including the expected volatility of the shares, the dividend yield and the risk free interest rate.
Further information on the share schemes is provided in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
The increase in investments and credit to equity for the 14-month period ended 30 September 2008 is 13.8m, comprising 0.3m relating to the period ended 30 September 2007 and 13.5m relating the year ended 30 September 2008.
Transactions of the Group-sponsored Employee Benefit Trust are included in the Companys financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and credited directly to equity.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the period and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Except as otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences, which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences arise when items of income and expenditure are included in tax computations in periods different from their inclusion in the financial statements.
Dividend on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability and deducted from equity in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are appropriately authorised and approved for payment and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
