SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Details of the share option schemes run by the Company, including information concerning vesting periods, amounts outstanding and the exercise price are contained in the remuneration report on pages 50 to 51 and 54 to 57.
The following disclosures relate to share option and SAYE grants made after 7 November 2002.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to calculate the fair value of the options and the amount to be expensed.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The inputs into the model expressed as weighted averages are as follows: Executive Options SAYE 2008 2007 2008 2007 Share price at grant date pence Group 589 1,967 702 1,767 Option exercise price pence Group 589 1,967 562 1,414 Share price at grant date pence Company 589 1,967 702 1,767 Option exercise price pence Company 589 1,967 562 1,414 Volatility % Group and Company 21.3% 19.7% 21.4% 23.2% Option life years Group and Company 4.0 4.0 3.8 3.6 Risk-free interest rate % Group and Company 3.6% 5.3% 4.2% 4.5% Expected dividends as a dividend yield % Group and Company 2.4% 2.3% 2.1% 2.1% Volatility was based on historic share prices over a period of time equal to the vesting period.
Option life used in the model has been based on options being exercised in accordance with historical patterns.
For executive share options the vesting period is 3 years.
If options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, these options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before options vest.
SAYE options vest after 3 or 5 years and expire 3 or 5 years after the date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds on a term consistent with the vesting period.
Dividends used are based on actual dividends where data is known and future dividends estimated using a dividend cover of 3 times.
It has also been assumed that performance conditions in respect of the executive share options and the share matching scheme will be met.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based upon managements best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
