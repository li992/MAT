The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IFRS 2 Share-based payments not to account for share options granted before 7 November 2002.
The charge recorded in the financial statements of the Group in respect of share-based payments is 1.9m 2007: 1.7m.
Executive Share Option Plans ESOPs The Group has in place three ESOPs, the 1998 scheme, the 2003 scheme and a one-off scheme.
Under these schemes, the remuneration committee may grant options over shares in The Restaurant Group plc to employees of the Group.
Awards under the ESOPs are generally reserved for senior management level and above.
The contractual life of an option is ten years.
Options granted under ESOPs become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to growth in earnings per share exceeding RPI growth by more than 4% under the 1998 scheme or 2.5% under the 2003 scheme.
Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group.
Options were valued using a Stochastic option pricing model.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
Note: The one-off scheme is in respect of Alan Jacksons share options granted on 5 June 2001.
Further details are provided in the Directors remuneration report on page 31.
During the year Alan Jackson exercised no options under this scheme, and as at 28 December 2008 there are 200,000 share options outstanding.
No charge to the income statement is recognised in respect of Alan Jacksons share options as they were granted prior to 7 November 2002.
Long-Term Incentive Plan On 9 November 2005 an Extraordinary General Meeting of The Restaurant Group plc approved the adoption of a new Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP for the Group, details of which are provided in the Directors remuneration report on pages 26 to 31.
Awards under the LTIP are generally reserved for senior management level and above.
Conditional Award share options and Matching Award share options were granted to Directors and selected employees on 7 December 2005, 8 March 2007 and 6 March 2008.
In respect of the Matching Award share options, the respective Director or employee was required to acquire a number of shares by 7 May 2006 in respect of the 7 December 2005 award, by 30 June 2007 in respect of the 8 March 2007 award and 30 June 2008 in respect of the 6 March 2008 award, known as Deposited Shares, and retain these shares until the Matching Award share options vest, for those Matching Award share options to be valid.
Vesting of share options under the LTIP is dependent on continuing employment.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise options before the normal period in which they are exercisable.
The options from the LTIP scheme will be satisfied through share purchases via a trust.

Employees pay a fixed amount from their salary into a savings account each month for the three-year savings period.
At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their options using the funds saved.
If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw their funds saved and the options expire.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise these options before the end of the three-year savings period.

In order to calculate volatility, the movement in the return index share price plus dividends re-invested over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to the remaining period over which the performance condition applies has been calculated.
For the SAYE awards and for the discount for the TSR performance condition for the relevant Conditional awards, the calculated volatility based on the movement in the return index over a period of 3.25 years and 3 years respectively prior to the grant has been used.

The Group borrows at floating rates and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile.
The use of any financial instruments is carefully controlled and monitored by the Board in line with the Groups treasury strategy and the terms and conditions of its facilities.
Managements approach to treasury is to: ensure sufficient committed loan facilities are in place to support anticipated business requirements: ensure the Groups debt service will be supported by anticipated cash flows and that covenants will be complied with: and manage interest rate exposure with a combination of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps.
Further details on the business risk factors that are considered to affect the Group and more specific financial risk management including sensitivity to increases in interest rates are included in the report of the Directors on pages 16 to 25.
Further details on market and economic risk is included in the Chief Executives review of operations on pages 9 and 10.

Interest is payable at floating interest rates which fluctuate and are dependent on LIBOR and base rate.
The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 2.98% 2007: 7.41%.
After taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps, the average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 2.10% 2007: 6.40%.
On 19 December 2007 the Group entered a 5 year facility agreement for 120m which was utilised from 17 January 2008 and replaced the existing facility under which the borrowings set out above for 2007 were drawn down.
Interest is payable on the amount drawn down at LIBOR plus mandatory cost and the banks margin, which is dependent on the debt to EBITDA ratio.
The Group has a 10m overdraft facility, which is repayable on demand, on which interest is payable at the banks overdraft rate.
The Group has 35.0m of committed borrowing facilities in excess of gross borrowings at 28 December 2008 30 December 2007: 41m.
The maturity profile of anticipated gross future cash flows, including interest, relating to the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis, are set out below.

The fixed rate for the duration of the three years is 2.975%.
Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2008 57 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The Group has derivative financial instruments relating to interest rate swaps and in accordance with IAS 39 these have been valued at 28 December 2008.
The fair value of these instruments was 1.1m and this is accounted for as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet 2007: 0.4m asset.
The movement in fair value has been recorded as a non-trading item in the consolidated income statement.
All financial assets and liabilities, excluding the interest rate swap, are accounted for at cost and the Directors consider the carrying value to approximate their fair value.
b Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group.
Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with large established financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet their obligations.
As a retail business with trading receipts settled either by cash or credit and debit cards, there is very limited exposure from customer transactions.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of retrospective discounts due from suppliers but management believe adequate provision has been made in respect of doubtful debts and there are no material amounts past due that have not been provided against.
The Group has an outstanding long-term receivable of 10.4m due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of the Groups associate company Pimco 2637 Limited.
This debt is secured on the assets of Living Ventures Restaurants Limited, formerly Est Est Est Restaurants Limited, but is subject to a prior ranking behind LV Finance Limiteds bank.
Following a detailed review of the carrying value of the business, including the loan note receivable, in 2007 the Board made full provision against the loan note due.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
c Liquidity risk The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reserves and bank facilities by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups loan facilities, which mature in 2012 as set out in note a above ensure continuity of funding, provided the Group continues to meet its covenant requirements as detailed in the Group Finance Directors report on page 13. d Foreign currency risk As the Group operates primarily within the United Kingdom any transactional or translational exposure to changes in foreign exchange rate is limited.
The three restaurants the Group operates in Spain are serviced by local Euro denominated debt.
The Group is not materially exposed to changes in foreign currency rates and does not use foreign exchange forward contracts.
e Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate movements is controlled through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve a balanced interest rate profile and to ensure that a minimum level of borrowings are at fixed rates for the next three years in line with the Groups treasury strategy.
Details of the current swaps are set out in note a above.
The interest rate profile is reviewed on a regular basis.
27 Lease commitments Future lease payments in respect of finance leases are due as follows: Minimum Present value of minimum lease payments lease payments 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 Within one year 274 271 274 271 Within two to five years 1,096 1,082 840 830 After five years 6,250 6,157 1,812 1,728 7,620 7,510 Less: Future interest payments 4,694 4,681 Present value of lease obligations 2,926 2,829 2,926 2,829 Analysed as: Amount due for settlement within one year 274 271 Amount due for settlement after one year 2,652 2,558 Present value of lease obligations 2,926 2,829 Lease commitments are in respect of property leases where the term of the lease is in excess of 25 years and the conditions of the lease are in keeping with a finance lease.
There are no finance leases where the Group itself is the lessor.
The interest rate applied in calculating the present value of the payments is the incremental borrowing cost of the Group in relation to each lease.
The fair value of the lease payments is estimated as 2.9m 2007: 2.8m.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2008 58 Notes to the accounts continued 27 Lease commitments continued The total future minimum rentals payable and receivable under operating leases over the remaining lives of the leases are: Payable Receivable Payable Receivable 2008 2008 2007 2007 Lease expiring: 000 000 000 000 Within one year 498 146 1,015 Within two to five years 13,964 3,004 25,321 2,608 After five years 544,190 43,221 483,653 42,914 558,652 46,371 509,989 45,522 The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms, both as lessee and lessor.
There are no restrictions imposed by the Groups operating leases, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable as contingent rents.
The lease payments for certain units, primarily in the Groups Concessions division, include an element that is dependent on the turnover of that unit.
28 Capital commitments 2008 2007 000 000 Authorised and contracted for: 12,379 12,948 29 Contingent liabilities The Group has assigned a number of leases to third parties that were originally completed prior to 1 January 1996 and hence unaffected by the Landlord and Tenant Covenants Act 1995 and also a number of leases completed after this date that were the subject of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.
Consequently, should the current tenant default, the landlord has a right of recourse to The Restaurant Group plc for future rental payments.
As and when any liability arises, the Group will take whatever steps necessary to mitigate the costs.
30 Related party transactions Pimco 2637 Limited is a related party to The Restaurant Group plc through the Groups 38% holding.
A loan note of 10.4m is due from LV Finance, a subsidiary of Pimco 2637 Limited, which attracts interest at the rate of LIBOR.
During the year ended 28 December 2008, 0.6m of interest was accrued of which the Group recognised nil 23 June to 30 December 2007: 0.3m of which the Group recognised nil.
Consequently, in addition to the 10.4m loan note outstanding at 28 December 2008, 0.9m interest had accrued, of which 0.4m was overdue under the terms of the agreement.
Living Ventures Limited was a related party of The Restaurant Group plc through the Groups 38% holding until 22 June 2007 when the Group disposed of its investment.
In 2007, the Group received 1.5m of interest due from Living Ventures Limited, of which 1.0m had not been recognised in the financial statements and was recorded as interest income in the year ended 30 December 2007.
Alan Jackson resigned as a director of Living Ventures Limited on 17 January 2007.
For the year to 30 December 2007, Alan Jackson received a fee of 2,916 from Living Ventures Limited in respect of his duties as non-executive chairman of that company.
Alan Jackson is a non-executive director of Charles Wells Limited, an independent brewing, pub and distribution company.
During 2005, The Restaurant Group plc entered into a lease for a site owned by Charles Wells Limited and subsequently this site was converted into a Frankie & Bennys restaurant.
No premium was paid by the Group to Charles Wells Limited.
The Group has entered into the lease with Charles Wells Limited, on an arms length basis, with an annual rent of 73,850 per annum.
In addition, the Group purchased products with a value totalling 0.9m 2007: 0.7m from Charles Wells Limited during the year, on an arms length basis.
No balance was directly outstanding at the year end.
