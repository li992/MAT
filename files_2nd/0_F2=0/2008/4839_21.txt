72 DSG international plc Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies 1.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to those companies reporting under IFRS.
The directors consider that the underlying performance measures, together with the associated income statement presentation, provide additional useful information for shareholders on underlying performance of the business, and are consistent with how business performance is measured internally.
Such measures exclude the amortisation of acquired intangibles, net restructuring and business impairment charges and other one-off items, profit on sale of investments, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments and, where applicable, discontinued operations.
These measures are not recognised profit measures under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures used by other companies.
During the period, the Group adopted the following new standards: IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the associated amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures.
IFRS 7 replaces the disclosure requirements of IAS 32 by introducing new disclosures to increase the information provided about financial instruments and risk exposures.
The presentation requirements of IAS 32 remain unchanged.
The IAS 1 amendment introduces new disclosures about the management of capital.
The principal accounting policies are set out below: 1.2 Accounting convention and basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to control the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired are included from the date on which power to control passes.
The net assets of subsidiaries acquired are recorded at their fair values.
The results of subsidiaries disposed of are included up to the effective date of disposal.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting from the date on which the power to exercise significant influence passes.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
1.3 Revenue Revenue comprises sales of goods and services excluding sales taxes.
Revenue from sales of goods is recognised at the point of sale or, where later, upon delivery to the customer and is stated net of returns.
Revenue earned from customer support agreements is recognised as such over the life of the agreement by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
1.4 Other income, including non operating income Other income which is incidental to the Groups principal activities of selling goods and services and accordingly is not recorded as part of revenue, is recognised when the Group obtains the right to consideration by performance of its contractual obligations.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established.
Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 73 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 1.5 Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Group which represents a significant separate line of business which has been sold.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or earlier if beneficial title and risk has transferred to the purchaser and in the case of a business acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal, on the date of acquisition.
1.6 Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
The determination of the classification of property leases is made by reference to the land and buildings elements separately.
All leases not classified as finance leases are operating leases.
Finance leases Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at their fair value on acquisition or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease and depreciated over their estimated useful lives or the lease term if shorter.
The corresponding obligation to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a liability.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation.
Finance charges are charged to the income statement over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
Operating leases Rentals payable under operating property leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the fixed term of the lease.
At the end of the fixed term of leases, rental payments are reset to market rates, typically on an upwards only basis.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1.7 Translation of foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses arising on settlement or retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are included in the income statement.
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange during the period.
Exchange differences resulting from the translation of the results and balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are charged or credited directly to retained earnings.
Such translation differences become recognised in the income statement in the period in which the subsidiary undertaking is disposed.
As the cumulative translation differences for all foreign subsidiaries were deemed to be zero at the transition date to IFRS on 2 May 2004, upon disposal of a foreign subsidiary, any gain or loss arising will include only those foreign exchange gains or losses attributable to periods after that date.
1.8 Goodwill On acquisition of a subsidiary or associate, the fair value of the consideration is allocated between the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets liabilities on a fair value basis, with any excess consideration representing goodwill.
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is capitalised as goodwill on the balance sheet: goodwill relating to associates is capitalised in investments in associates as part of the carrying value of the associate.
Goodwill is not amortised, but instead is reviewed annually for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal.
74 DSG international plc Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued 1.9 Intangible assets Acquired intangibles Acquired intangibles comprise brands and customer lists purchased as part of acquisitions of businesses and are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight-line basis.
Acquired intangibles are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight-line basis between three and 30 years.
Other intangible assets: computer software Computer software is capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred both to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between three and seven years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred unless they increase the future economic benefits of the asset, in which case they are capitalised.
Internally generated computer software is capitalised at cost if the project is technically and commercially feasible and the economic benefits which are expected to be generated exceed one year.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight-line basis between three and seven years.
Computer software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal.
1.10 Property, plant & equipment Property, plant & equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful lives.
The rates used are: Short leasehold property over the term of the lease 2 Freehold and long leasehold buildings between 1 % and 2% per annum 3 1 Fixtures, fittings and equipment between 10% and 33 3% per annum No depreciation is provided on freehold and long leasehold land or on assets in the course of construction.
Property, plant & equipment is assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to the conclusion that the carrying value is not supportable.
Where assets are to be taken out of use, an impairment charge is levied.
Where assets useful lives are shortened, an estimate is made of their new lives and an accelerated depreciation charge is levied.
Where the property, plant & equipment form part of a separate cash generating unit CGU the recoverable amount of the CGU is determined by calculating its value in use.
The value in use is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to managements projection of future profitability and any impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value with the value in use.
Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 75 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 1.11 Investments and other financial assets The Groups financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and those receivables which involve a contractual right to receive cash from external parties.
Financial assets comprise all items shown in notes 14, 15 and 16 with the exception of prepayments.
Under the classifications stipulated by IAS 39, short term investments and trade and other receivables, excluding derivative financial assets are classified as available for sale and loans and receivables, respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, which are further described in notes 1.14 and 1.16, are classified as loans and receivables and held for trading unless designated in a hedge relationship, respectively.
Investment in associates Associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting from the date on which the power to exercise significant influence passes.
All purchases and sales of investments and other financial assets are recognised on the date that the Group becomes committed to make such purchase or sale the trade date.
Short term investments Investments are initially measured at fair value and then subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date owing to occasional sales of such investments.
The fair value of unlisted investments is estimated either by comparing recent arms length transactions or by using discounted cash flow analysis or other modelling techniques.
Gains and losses arising from revaluation at the balance sheet date are recognised directly in equity.
For unlisted investments a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost is considered evidence of impairment.
To the extent that any fair value losses are deemed permanent, such impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Upon sale or impairment of the investments, any cumulative gains or losses held in equity are transferred to the income statement.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables excluding derivative financial assets are recorded at cost less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts and any other adjustments required to align cost to fair value.
The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced through the use of a provision account.
A provision for bad and doubtful debts is made for specific receivables when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
Receivables that are not assessed individually for impairment are assessed for impairment on a collective basis using ageing analysis to determine the required provision.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
1.12 Taxation Current taxation Current taxation is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using prevailing tax rates and adjusted for any tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
No provision is made for tax which would have been payable on the distribution of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries or associated undertakings, unless the distribution of such earnings has been accrued in the balance sheet.
76 DSG international plc Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
1.13 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct purchase cost and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition, both types of cost being measured using a weighted average cost formula.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated and directly attributable costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
1.14 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, bank overdrafts and short term highly liquid deposits with a maturity of three months or less and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts, which form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement, are shown under current liabilities.
1.15 Borrowings and other financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities are those which involve a contractual obligation to deliver cash to external parties at a future date.
Financial liabilities comprise all items shown in notes 17, 18 and 19 with the exception of other taxation and social security, accruals and deferred income from customer support agreements, other deferred income and other non financial creditors.
Under the classifications stipulated by IAS 39, borrowings, finance lease obligations and trade and other payables excluding derivative financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments, which are described further in note 1.16 below, are classified as held for trading unless designated in a hedge relationship.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recorded at the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
Transaction costs are amortised through the income statement using the effective interest method and the unamortised balance is included as part of the related borrowing at the balance sheet date.
A fair value adjustment is made to the borrowing where hedge accounting, as described in note 1.16 below, has been applied.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables excluding derivative financial liabilities are recorded at cost.
Derivative financial instruments, which includes put options over equity held by minority shareholders, are initially recorded at fair value and then subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date and are held within assets or liabilities as appropriate.
Gains and losses arising from revaluation at the balance sheet date are recognised in the income statement unless the derivatives are designated as hedges and such hedges are proved to be effective.
Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 77 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 1.16 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments held by the Group are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value within assets or liabilities as appropriate and then subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date.
Derivatives are classified as non-current assets or liabilities where a hedge relationship is identified and the remaining maturity of the hedged item is greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Derivatives are classified as current assets or liabilities in all other circumstances.
Fair values are derived from market values.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, options, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts to hedge these risks.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where hedge accounting is to be applied, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting.
The accounting treatment of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting is dependent on how they are designated.
The different designations and accounting treatments are explained below: Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments that meet the fair value hedging requirements are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with corresponding fair value movements recognised within finance income costs in the income statement.
For an effective fair value hedge, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the income statement.
To the extent that the designated hedge relationship is effective, such amounts in the income statement offset each other.
As a result, only the ineffective element of any designated hedging relationship impacts the income statement.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item for which the effective interest method is used, is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure on inventory ordered and purchased and certain sales of inventory.
It is Group policy to hedge between 80% and 100% of committed purchase orders and sales.
At any point in time the Group also hedges up to 80% of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecast purchases and sales for the subsequent 12 months.
Orders and purchases as well as sales are each considered to be separate hedge transactions.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify for such cash flow hedging are initially recognised on the balance sheet with gains and losses relating to the remeasurement of the effective portion of the hedge being deferred in equity.
To the extent that such items are ineffectively hedged, gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss i. e. when a purchase or sale is made.
78 DSG international plc Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued For inventory purchases, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of inventory.
For sales, the gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the income statement in the period in which the sale is made.
Net investment hedges The Group uses currency forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge its currency risk on the translation of net investments in foreign entities.
Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of the investments and the related derivatives are recognised in equity.
However, this is on the basis that the hedging requirements of IAS 39 are met and the hedging relationship is effective.
To the extent that such items are ineffectively hedged, gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised within the income statement.
1.17 Retirement benefit obligations Company contributions to defined contribution pension schemes and contributions made to state pension schemes for certain overseas employees are charged to the income statement on an accruals basis as contributions become payable.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the regular service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the period, together with the cost of any benefits relating to past service is charged to operating profit in the period.
A credit representing the expected return on assets of the retirement benefit schemes during the year is included within other finance income.
This is based on the market value of the assets of the schemes at the start of the financial period.
A charge is included within other finance costs, representing the expected increase in the liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes during the period.
The difference between the market value of the assets and the present value of the accrued pension liabilities is shown as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.
Differences between the actual and expected returns on assets during the period are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense, together with differences arising from changes in actuarial assumptions.
1.18 Share-based payments The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees which are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
This fair value is expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest as adjusted for any non-market conditions.
A liability equal to the portion of services received from employees is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date for cash settled share-based payments.
1.19 Estimates, judgements and critical accounting policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Significant items subject to such assumptions and estimates include the useful lives of assets: the measurement and recognition of provisions: the recognition of deferred tax assets: and liabilities for potential corporation tax.
Actual results could differ from these estimates and any subsequent changes are accounted for with an effect on income at the time such updated information becomes available.
The most critical accounting policies in determining the financial condition and results of the Group are those requiring the greatest degree of subjective or complex judgements.
These relate to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, lease costs, the valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets, share-based payments, post-retirement benefits and taxation, and are set out below.
Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 79 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Revenue recognition Revenue earned from the sale of customer support agreements is recognised over the term of the contracts when the Group obtains the right to consideration by performance of its contractual obligations.
Performance of these contractual obligations is determined by reference to extensive historical claims data.
Reliance on historical data assumes that current and future experience will follow past trends.
The directors consider that the quantity and quality of data available provides an appropriate proxy for current trends.
Inventory valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value includes, where necessary, provisions for slow moving and damaged inventory.
The provision represents the difference between the cost of stock and its estimated market value, based on ageing.
Calculation of these provisions requires judgements to be made which include forecast consumer demand, the promotional, competitive and economic environment and inventory loss trends.
Provisions and accruals for onerous leases If the Group vacates a store or other property prior to the expiry of the related lease, it records a provision for the expected lease payments that the Group will incur prior to assignment or sublease of the property.
Such a calculation requires a judgement as to the timing and duration of the expected vacancy periods and the amount and timing of future potential sublease income.
When making these judgements, the directors consider a number of factors, including the landlord, the location and condition of the property, the terms of the lease, the specific marketplace demand and the economic environment.
Goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment impairment reviews Goodwill is required to be valued annually to assess the requirement for potential impairment.
Other assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to the conclusion that the carrying value of such assets is not supportable.
Impairment testing on goodwill is carried out in accordance with the analyses described in note 9.
Such calculations require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors and long term growth prevalent in a particular market as well as short and medium term business plans.
The directors draw upon experience as well as external resources in making these judgements.
In assessing impairment of intangible assets and property, plant & equipment discounted cash flow methods are used as described in note 1.10.
Judgement is required in determining the appropriate discount factors as well as the short and medium term business plans.
As for goodwill, the directors draw upon experience and external resources in making these judgements.
Share-based payments The charge for share-based payments is calculated in accordance with the analysis described in note 25.
The option valuation models used require highly subjective assumptions to be made including the future volatility of the Companys share price, expected dividend yields, risk-free interest rates and expected staff turnover.
The directors draw upon a variety of external sources to aid in the determination of the appropriate data to use in such calculations.
Defined benefit pension schemes The surplus or deficit in the UK defined benefit scheme that is recognised through the statement of recognised income and expense is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties.
The calculated liabilities of the scheme are based on assumptions regarding salary increases, inflation rates, discount rates, the long term expected return on the schemes assets and member longevity.
Details of the assumptions used are shown in note 27.
Such assumptions are based on actuarial advice and are benchmarked against similar pension schemes.
80 DSG international plc Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Taxation Tax laws that apply to the Groups businesses may be amended by the relevant authorities, for example as a result of changes in fiscal circumstances or priorities.
Such potential amendments and their application to the Group are regularly monitored and the requirement for recognition of any liabilities assessed where necessary.
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of different jurisdictions and judgement is required in determining the appropriate provision for transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
In such circumstances, the Group recognises liabilities for anticipated taxes due based on best information available and where the anticipated liability is probable and estimable.
Where the final outcome of such matters differs from the amounts initially recorded, any differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period to which such determination is made.
Where the potential liabilities are not considered probable, the amount at risk is disclosed unless an adverse outcome is considered remote.
Deferred tax is recognised on taxable losses based on the expected ability to utilise such losses.
This ability takes account of the business plans for the relevant companies, potential uncertainties around the longer term aspects of these business plans, any expiry of taxable benefits and potential future volatility in the local tax regimes.
1.20 New accounting standards and interpretations During the period, the following new standards which are applicable to the Group were published, but do not become effective until future accounting periods: IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
IFRS 8 adopts a management approach to segmental reporting requiring the identification of operating segments based on internal reporting to the chief operating decision maker and extends the scope and disclosure requirements of IAS 14 Segmental Reporting.
It is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and will have no impact on the net results or net assets of the Group.
IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements.
This revises the presentation of non-owner changes in equity and introduces a statement of comprehensive income.
It is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and is not expected to have an impact on the net results, net assets or disclosures of the Group.
This removes the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial time to prepare for use.
It therefore requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs as part of the costs of such assets.
IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations and IAS 27 Revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
IFRS 3 Revised introduces a number of changes in the accounting for business combinations that will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs and the future reported results.
IAS 27 Revised requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction.
These changes must be applied prospectively and will affect future acquisitions and transactions with minority interests.
The revised standards are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
Certain interpretations were issued during the period which either do not apply to the Group or are not expected to have any material effect.
Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 81 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 2 Segmental analysis The Group is managed and reported according to three operating divisions: Computing, Electricals and e-commerce.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segmental information.
The principal activities of each division are as follows: the Computing division is engaged in the retail and business to business sale of computer hardware and software, associated peripherals and services and related financial and after-sales services.
The division operates in the UK and Southern Europe which also includes the small Nordic operations.
Results for 2006 07 include the activities of the Groups store based operations in France, which the Group announced its withdrawal from in that financial year.
Any closure costs arising in 2007 08 have been categorised as non-underlying: the Electricals division is engaged in the retail sale of high technology consumer electronics, domestic appliances, photographic equipment and related financial and after-sales services.
The division operates in the UK, Ireland, the Nordic region, Southern Europe and Central Europe: and the e-commerce division is engaged in the online retail sale of high technology consumer electronics, domestic appliances, photographic equipment and related financial and after-sales services.
The division operates in the UK, Ireland, the Nordic region, Southern Europe and Central Europe.
During the period management responsibility for a small business services related part of the business was transferred from the Computing division to the Electricals division.
Comparative figures have been restated to reflect this change in responsibility.
Corporate centre & shared services assets and liabilities comprise mainly freehold land and buildings, investments, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, net retirement benefit obligations, intersegment adjustments and eliminations and related tax assets and liabilities.
The income statement for Corporate centre & shared services includes intersegment eliminations.
The Groups secondary reporting segments are geographical and comprise four territories: the UK & Ireland, the Nordic region, Southern Europe and Central Europe.
There were no material exports from the locations in which the Group operates.

Asset impairments relate to intangible assets and items of property, plant & equipment which are to be eliminated from the business over a shorter period than their current useful expected lives and inventories.
Impairments relating to intangible assets and property, plant & equipment comprise a combination of asset write offs and incremental accelerated depreciation charges associated with the economic useful life of these assets being shortened and for which incremental charges of 17.7 million are expected to be spread over the next two financial periods.
Other charges predominantly comprise employee severance 2006 07 also included certain incremental transition costs.
The Italian business impairment relates to UniEuro S. p. A. UniEuro.
Goodwill is discussed further in note 9.
Other asset impairments comprise other intangible assets, property, plant & equipment and inventory.
Such impairments relate to assets in individual under performing stores connected with impairment reviews of the relevant businesses and for which either stores have been deemed impaired or are to be closed.
Other charges relate predominantly to employee severance.
ii Effect of changes in pension benefits: 2006 07 related to the change in benefits accruing to members of the UK defined benefit pension scheme following changes in legislation concerning lump sums allowed on retirement commutations.

iv Net fair value remeasurement gains and losses on revaluation of financial instruments: Items excluded from underlying finance income and expense represent the gains and losses arising from the revaluation of derivative financial instruments under methodologies stipulated by IAS 39 compared with those on an accruals basis the basis upon which all other items in the financial statements is prepared.
Also included within this amount are remeasurement losses relating to put options predominantly held by minority shareholders.
Such a treatment is a form of revaluation gain or loss created by an assumption that the derivatives will be settled before their maturity.
Such gains and losses are unrealised and in the directors view also conflict with both the commercial reasons for entering into such arrangements as well as Group Treasury policy whereby early settlement in the majority of cases would amount to speculative use of derivatives.

As required by IFRS 3, goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews.
These reviews are carried out using the following criteria.
An amount of goodwill is attributed to each specific acquisition.
Such acquisitions are determined to be a Cash Generating Unit CGU as determined by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined based on calculating its value in use.
The value in use is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to managements own projections covering a five year period.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a long term growth rate equivalent to the relevant markets Gross Domestic Product GDP.
The value in use is compared to the carrying amount in order to determine whether impairment has occurred.
The impairment charge in the current year relates predominantly to UniEuro 2006 07 UniEuro and is discussed further below.
The most significant components of goodwill relate to Elkjp Nordic AS Elkjp, UniEuro S. p. A. UniEuro and FotoVista S. A. S. FotoVista.
In addition to managements five year projections, the key assumptions used in calculating value in use as well as the carrying values are: 2008 2007 Key assumptions Key assumptions Pre tax risk Pre tax risk Growth rate adjusted Carrying Growth rate adjusted Carrying beyond discount value beyond discount value five years rate million five years rate million Elkjp 2.5% 11.4% 585.5 2.2% 11.1% 516.3 UniEuro 1.2% 12.7% 129.0 1.4% 12.9% 325.9 FotoVista 2.3% 13.7% 162.5 1.8% 13.3% 141.9 The growth rate beyond five years is based on GDP for the territories in which these businesses operate.
The discount rates applied to cash flows are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital with a risk premium reflecting the relative risks in the markets in which the businesses operate.
94 DSG international plc Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 9 Goodwill continued Managements five year projections have been prepared on the basis of strategic plans, knowledge of the market, performance of competitors and managements views on achievable growth in market share over the longer term.
For UniEuro, the continuing weakness in the Italian economy highlighted by poor trading in the current period, coupled with further increased competition in the market has caused the directors to further revise significantly the projections for the five year period referred to above and which has been used to assess impairment in previous financial periods.
As a result of this revision, an impairment loss of 246.2 million has been recognised in the current period.
Sensitivities A sensitivity analysis had been performed on the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill.
The directors have concluded that in the case of Elkjp there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use.
In the case of UniEuro and FotoVista, it is reasonably possible that a change in key assumptions could occur over the course of the next financial period.
UniEuro In respect of managements five year projections, a decrease of 5.0% in the compound annual growth rate in pre tax profits over this five year period would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use by 1.6 million.
In addition, the five year projections are sensitive to the level and timing of cost reduction initiatives built into the five year compound annual growth rate in pre tax profits.
An average reduction of 10% per annum in such savings over that five year period would cause the goodwill to exceed its value in use by 3.5 million.
A decrease in the growth rate beyond five years of 0.1% and an increase in the pre tax adjusted discount rate of 0.1% would cause the goodwill to exceed its value in use by 1.2 million and 1.7 million, respectively.
FotoVista In respect of managements five year projections, a 1.0% decrease in compound annual growth rate would cause the current headroom of 26.6 million to erode by 7.9 million.
A decrease in the growth rate beyond five years of 0.1% and an increase in the pre tax adjusted discount rate of 0.1% would cause the goodwill to exceed its value in use by 1.7 million and 2.7 million, respectively.

The currency swaps carry fixed rates ranging from 3.46% to 5.99% 28 April 2007 4.60% to 5.72% and the main floating rates are based on EURIBOR and LIBOR which ranged between 5.14% and 7.37% 28 April 2007 4.90% to 6.52%.
The Group holds options to acquire equity stakes in other businesses which are recorded at nil 28 April 2007 nil owing to the option prices being at or above their current market value.
c Hedging activities The Group manages exposures that arise on purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies by entering predominantly into forward foreign exchange currency contracts.
It also uses swaps and options to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange translation exposure.
The Group designates financial instruments as hedges under IAS 39 as follows: Cash flow hedges At 3 May 2008 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts in place with a notional value of 351.5 million 28 April 2007 541.5 million that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges.
The fair value of these currency derivatives, which have been deferred in equity amounts to a 1.5 million loss 28 April 2007 2.7 million loss.
In respect of contracts which matured during the period, losses of 11.5 million and profits of 6.4 million have been transferred out of equity into inventory and out of equity into operating profit, respectively 2006 07 losses of 3.1 million and 5.4 million have been transferred out of equity into inventory and out of equity into operating profit, respectively.
No significant hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement 2006 07 nil.
Fair value hedges At 3 May 2008 and 28 April 2007 the Group had interest rate swaps in place with a notional amount of 300 million whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 6.125% and pays a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread on the notional amount with a November 2012 maturity.
The swaps are used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of the Bonds and have the same critical terms.
The fair value of interest rate swaps entered into as fair value hedges is a liability of 0.1 million 28 April 2007 a liability of 5.9 million.
A fair value loss on the interest rate swaps of 5.6 million 2006 07 gain of 9.6 million has been recognised in the income statement and offset by an equivalent fair value gain on the Bonds.
Hedge of net investments in foreign operations At 3 May 2008 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps in place with a notional value of 858.1 million 28 April 2007 827.7 million which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in foreign operations.
Gains and losses on the retranslation of these derivatives are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the foreign operations.
The fair value of currency derivatives entered into as net investment hedges is a 104.9 million loss 2006 07 5.9 million loss.
No hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement 2006 07 nil.

Sterling cash and investments include 66.5 million 28 April 2007 111.2 million of restricted funds which predominantly comprise funds held under trust to fund customer support agreement liabilities.
Sterling floating rate assets comprise floating rate notes together with cash and commercial paper.
Sterling fixed rate assets comprise money market deposits.
Sterling floating rate borrowings comprise bank overdrafts and 50 million of the Bonds that bear interest at rates based on LIBOR.
The remaining 250 million of the Bonds have been swapped into floating rate euro borrowings.
After taking account of interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, no sterling borrowings carry interest at fixed rates 28 April 2007 none.

e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and total equity to changes in specified market variables.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Groups total equity due to changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges.
The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Groups key currencies, with other variables held constant.

The impact of movements in exchange rates are recorded directly in equity: and changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments that are not in hedging relationships arising from movements in interest rates and exchange rates only affect the income statement to the extent that they are not offset by changes in an underlying transaction.

Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 115 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 27 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The principal scheme which operates in the UK includes a funded defined benefit section whose assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the actuarys advice so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants.
Membership of the defined contribution section is offered to eligible employees.
In the Nordic region, the Group operates secured defined benefit pension schemes with assets held by a life insurance company and an unsecured pension arrangement.
In addition, contributions are made to a state pension scheme.
In other territories, the Group also provides other additional post-employment benefits.
In particular, in Greece and Italy, the Group has state related obligations to fund post employment benefits to employees.
a Defined contribution pension schemes The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes was 5.1 million 2006 07 2.2 million.
A further 0.1 million 2006 07 0.1 million provision was made in respect of the Nordic unsecured pension arrangement.
b UK defined benefit pension scheme actuarial valuation and assumptions A full actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2007 using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level of funding to the scheme.
The Groups contribution rate for the period ended 3 May 2008, agreed in consultation with the trustees actuaries, was 12.6% 2006 07 12.9% with the reduction representing a change in the mix of contributions between different sections of the scheme.
The contribution rate for future periods is currently planned to remain at this level, however a recovery plan has been agreed with the trustees whereby the Company is to make twice yearly contributions of 6.0 million commencing in June 2008 and ending in December 2012.
Since April 2007, the scheme has operated on a career average revalued earnings arrangement where benefits are earned for each year of pensionable service as opposed to being calculated with reference to salary near to date of retirement.
The principal actuarial assumptions as at 5 April 2007 used for determining costs and contributions were: Rate per annum Discount rate Pre retirement 6.6% Post retirement 5.2% Rate of increase in Up to April 2010 3.5% pensionable salaries Thereafter 4.5% Rate of increase to pensions Guaranteed Minimum Pension 3.0% Pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.5%-3.75% Inflation 3.0% Expected return on assets 6.5% At 5 April 2007, the market value of the schemes investments was 688 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 92% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The value of liabilities exceeded assets by 61.0 million.

The methodologies set out in IAS 19 are different from those used by the scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
i Principal assumptions adopted: Rates per annum 2008 2007 Discount rate 6.5% 5.6% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries up to April 2010 4.1% 4.5% thereafter 5.1% 4.5% Rate of increase in pensions in payment deferred pensions 3.6% 3.0% Inflation 3.6% 3.0% The Group uses certain mortality rate assumptions when calculating scheme obligations.
The demographic assumptions used are those underlying the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 5 April 2007.
In particular, post retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard tables PA92 projected to calendar year 2008 in line with the medium cohort factors set out in CMI working paper 1: interim basis for adjusting the 92 series mortality projections for cohort effects, with an allowance for future mortality improvement in line with medium cohort projection factors.
Such tables represent an average expected longevity of 85.2 years for men and 88.3 years for women 2006 07 84.2 years for men and 87.4 years for women for those becoming 65 at the measurement date and an extra one year of longevity for both men and women becoming 65 in 15 years time.
