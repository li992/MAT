The carrying amounts of the Groups trade receivables and accrued income are stated after deducting a provision of 199.6 million at 31 March 2008 2007 - 208.6 million for doubtful debts and sales allowances.
A provision for uncollectible trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The provision is calculated by estimating future cash flows from trade receivables on the basis of historical loss experience.
A receivable is written off against the provision when it is believed to be entirely uncollectible.
Any monies recovered subsequent to write-off are recorded as adjustments to the bad debt provision and considered in the local historical loss experience.
The movements in the provision for doubtful debts were as follows for the years ended 31 March 2008 and 2007: millions 2008 2007 At beginning of year 208.6 157.8 Charged to income statement 97.1 99.3 Acquisition of subsidiaries 1.4 45.5 Disposal of subsidiaries 0.4 15.5 Writeoffs and exchange movement 107.1 78.5 Balance at 31 March 199.6 208.6 The Company has no trade receivables or provision for doubtful debts.
