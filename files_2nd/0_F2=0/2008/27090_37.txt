Company Law states that Investment Companies may only distribute accumulated realised pro ts.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, in its technical guidance TECH 01 08, states that pro ts arising out of a change in fair value of assets, recognised in accordance with Accounting Standards, can be distributed, provided the change recognised can be readily converted into cash.
Securities listed on a recognised stock exchange are generally regarded as being readily convertible into cash and hence unrealised pro ts in respect of such securities, currently included within the Unrealised Capital Reserve, can be regarded as distributable under Company Law.
This technical interpretation of the meaning of distributable reserves would, as a consequence, give rise at 30 April 2008 to capital reserves available for distribution of approximately 967.4 million.
