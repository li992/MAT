100 Tullow Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Accounts Group overview Directors report: Business review Directors report: Corporate governance Financial statements The Group is exposed to floating rate interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The Group hedges its floating rate interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate derivatives, namely interest rate swaps, interest rate collars and interest rate caps.
All interest rate derivatives currently in place were put in place for a three-year period in May 2008 and expire in May 2011.
The interest rate swap currently in place has a swap rate of 3.4375% for a current notional principal of US$50 million 34.5 million.
The effect of the interest rate collar currently in place limits the exposure to US Dollar LIBOR at varying rates maximum of 4.3% over the life of the derivative for a current notional principal of US$50 million 34.5 million.
The combined mark-to-market position as at the 2008 year end was 2,089,000 2007: 104,000.
The interest rate hedges are included in fixed rate debt in 2008 and were included in the floating rate debt table in 2007 as there was non-material differences between book and fair values for the mark-to-markets on the hedges in place at the time.
Foreign currency risk Wherever possible, the Group conducts and manages its business in Sterling UK and US Dollars all other countries, the functional currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates.
A natural hedge exists in the majority of the Groups oil and gas income and expenditure, which are denominated in US Dollars and Sterling respectively.
The Groups borrowing facilities are also denominated in Sterling and US Dollars, which further assists in foreign currency risk management.
From time to time the Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
These exposures are managed by executing foreign currency financial derivatives, typically to manage exposures arising on corporate transactions such as acquisitions and disposals.
There were no foreign currency financial derivatives in place at the 2008 year end.
Cash balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating and administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
As at 31 December 2008, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were US$930 million 642.3 million cash drawings under the US$1,350 million Borrowing Base Facility and US$100 million 69.1 million cash drawings under the US$200 million Hardman Bridge Facility.
As at 31 December 2007 the only material assets or liabilities that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were US$570 million 285.4 million cash drawings under the US$1,350 million Borrowing Base facility and US$400 million 200.3 million cash drawings under the $550million Hardman Bridge Facility.
These US Dollar cash drawings at 31 December 2008 continue to be held as a hedge against US Dollar denominated net assets in subsidiaries.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are 444.5 million 2007: 452.2 million.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to fluctuation in the US Dollar.
The Group measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses including 20% favourable and adverse changes in the key variables.
The sensitivity analyses include only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 20% change in foreign currency rates.
As at 31 December 2008, a 20% increase in Sterling against the US Dollar would have resulted in a decrease in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of 133.1 million 2007: 49.4 million 10% increase and a 20% decrease in Sterling against US Dollar would have resulted in an increase in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of 199.7 million 2007: 60.3 million 10% decrease.
Liquidity risk The Group manages the liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash flow projections, supplemented by maintaining debt financing plans and active portfolio management.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices and different production rates from the Groups portfolio of producing fields.
The Group normally seeks to ensure that it has a minimum ongoing capacity of 200 million for a period of at least 12 months to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Following the equity placing announced in January 2009 and securing the US$2 billion financing in March 2009, the Groups forecasts and projections show that there is significant capacity and financial flexibility for the 12 months from the date of this Annual Report and Accounts.
Although there is considerable economic uncertainty at the present time, after taking account of the above, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
