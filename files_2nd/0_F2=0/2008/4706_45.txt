The larger plans are generally of the defined benefit type and are funded by payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies.
The principal plans are in the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States and Canada.
All valuations were performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit method to determine pension costs.
The most recent full valuations of the significant defined benefit pension plans were carried out as follows: United Kingdom on 31 March 2006: Ireland on 31 December 2006: and United States on 1 January 2007.
The measurement dates used to calculate the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are the respective balance sheet dates.
In the United Kingdom, the Diageo Pension Scheme closed to new members in November 2005.
New employees in the United Kingdom are now eligible to become members of the Diageo Lifestyle Plan, which is also a defined benefit pension plan.
The assets of the principal pension plans are held in separate funds administered by trustees to meet long term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
The two largest pension plans are the Diageo Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom and the Guinness Ireland Pension Scheme in Ireland.
For the Diageo Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom, the trustee is Diageo Pension Trust Limited.
The appointment of the directors to the board is determined by the Schemes trust documentation.
There is a policy that one-third of all directors should be nominated by members of the Scheme.
Two member nominated directors have recently been appointed from the pensioner member community and two from the active member community.
For the Guinness Ireland Pension Scheme, the appointment of trustees is strictly a company decision.
Currently the company makes three nominations and appoints three further candidates nominated by representative groupings.
The chairman is a former employee of the company and is viewed as independent.
The group also operates a number of plans, primarily in the United States, which provide employees with post employment benefits in respect of medical costs.
These plans are generally unfunded.
In addition, there are a number of other plans which provide post employment benefits other than pensions and medical benefits.
These plans are also included in the figures presented below.
a The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the groups deficit surplus in the main post employment plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the charge credit in the consolidated income statement for the year to 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June.

The 2008 assumption for medical inflation in the United States reduces by 0.5% per year to 5% 2007 0.5% per year to 5%: 2006 1% per year to 5%.
In assessing the groups post retirement liabilities, the mortality assumption for the largest plan which is in the United Kingdom is based on the mortality experience of that plan.
This mortality experience analysis was carried out in 2006 as part of the triennial funding valuation of that plan.
The assumption is based on the PA92 birth year tables with scaling factors based on the experience of the plan.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the medium cohort effect.
The mortality assumptions for the other plans around the world are based on relevant standard mortality tables in each country.

The expected long term rate of return on other assets in the UK was adjusted to reflect this.
114 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE SUMMARY BUSINESS DESCRIPTION BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE OTHER INFORMATION 212833 DIAGEO REPORT P106-127 5 9 08 10:14 Page 115 DIAGEO | ANNUAL REPORT 2008 Post employment benefit assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, depending on whether an individual plan is in surplus or deficit, as follows: 2008 2007 million million Non-current assets 47 38 Non-current liabilities 455 457 408 419 The expected long term rates of return for equities have been determined by reference to government bond rates minimum risk rates in the countries in which the plans are based.
As at 30 June 2008, to reflect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long term rates of return on equities include a risk premium of 3.25% per year 2007 and 2006 3.25% per year in excess of the expected return from government bonds.
This risk premium is a long term assumption which is set after taking actuarial advice and considering the assumptions used by other FTSE 100 companies.
The expected long term rates of return for other assets are determined in a similar way, by using an appropriate risk premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country.
The groups investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally by the trustees of the plan and or Diageo, as appropriate, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the return on the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the group of the post employment plans being lower over the long term, and will be within acceptable boundaries of risk.
Each investment strategy is also designed to control investment risk by managing allocations to asset classes, geographical exposures and individual stock exposures.
At 30 June 2008, approximately 40% 2007 40% of the UK Diageo Pension Schemes liabilities and approximately 40% 2007 nil of the Guinness Ireland Pension Schemes liabilities were hedged against future movements in interest rates and inflation through the use of swaps.
The fair value of these swaps was an asset of 169 million 2007 liability of 64 million for the UK Scheme and an asset of 22 million 2007 nil for the Guinness Ireland Scheme.
These amounts are included in other assets in the table of fair value of plan assets.
The discount rate is based on the yields of high quality, long dated, fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities.
For the UK pension plans, which represent approximately 67% of total post employment benefit liabilities, the discount rate is based on the iBoxx over 15-year AA sterling corporate bond index at 30 June rounded to the nearest 0.1%.
A similar process is used to determine the discount rate for the non-UK plans.

For these purposes, the value of the deficit, calculated using the trustees actuarial valuation of the Scheme, was ascertained through the triennial valuation as at 31 March 2006.
Following the completion of that valuation, Diageo has undertaken to make an annual 50 million cash contribution in each of the four years of the funding plan.
The first payment of 50 million was made in the year ended 30 June 2007, with a further 50 million contribution in the year ended 30 June 2008.
Payments are made into an escrow account subject to an agreement between the group and the trustees, with release from escrow to either the group or the trustees determined by an agreed formula in the light of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 31 March 2009.
Investment returns on the funds held in escrow accrue to the group.
This amount held in escrow is included in other investments on the consolidated balance sheet and is not included in the table above.
In addition to the deficit funding, Diageo continues to make a cash contribution in respect of current service cost based on the trustees valuation: this contribution is expected to be 49 million in the year ending 30 June 2009.
Funding arrangements will be reviewed and adjusted in the light of future triennial actuarial valuations.
Contributions to other plans in the year ending 30 June 2009 are expected to be approximately 57 million.
