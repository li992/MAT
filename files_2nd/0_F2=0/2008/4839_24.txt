128 DSG international plc Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements a Accounting policies The unconsolidated financial statements for the Company have been prepared in accordance with UK law and applicable UK GAAP accounting standards.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied throughout the current and preceding periods with the exception of changes caused by the adoption of UITF 44 IFRIC Interpretation 11 FRS 20 Group and Treasury Share Transactions UITF 44.
The principal accounting policies are set out below: i Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain derivative financial instruments to fair value.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and has not disclosed information required by that standard, as the consolidated financial statements for DSG international plc, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
ii Change in accounting policy and presentation of financial information Where the Company has granted rights over its equity to employees of subsidiary undertakings in relation to equity settled share-based payments arrangements, UITF 44 requires recognition of the contribution to subsidiary undertakings.
This contribution is recognised as a movement in the investment in subsidiary undertaking.
iii Operating leases Rentals payable under property leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal instalments up to each market rent review date throughout the lease term.
Rentals payable under leases for plant and machinery are charged to the profit and loss account in equal instalments over the total lease term.
iv Share-based payments The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees which are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
This fair value is expensed in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest as adjusted for any non-market conditions.
A liability equal to the portion of services received from employees is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date for cash settled share-based payments.
v Translation of foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses arising on settlement or retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are included in the profit and loss account.
vi Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment or estimated loss on disposal.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful lives.
The rates used are: Fixtures, fittings and equipment between 10% and 333% per annum.
Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 129 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 vii Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
viii Taxation Current taxation Current taxation is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using prevailing tax rates and adjusted for any tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided for in full on all timing differences which have not reversed at the balance sheet date.
No provision is made for tax which would become payable on the distribution of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries or associated undertakings, unless the distribution of such earnings has been accrued in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
ix Borrowings Borrowings are initially recorded at the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
Transaction costs are amortised through the income statement using the effective interest method and the unamortised balance is included as part of the related borrowing at the balance sheet date.
A fair value adjustment is made to the borrowing where hedge accounting has been applied.
x Post retirement benefits The expected cost of providing pensions under the defined benefit pension scheme arrangements, as calculated periodically by qualified actuaries, is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members in such a way that the pension cost is a substantially level percentage of current and expected future pensionable payroll.
It is not practical to allocate the underlying assets and liabilities of the defined benefit section to individual companies, on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Therefore, following full implementation of FRS 17, the Company has accounted for its contributions to the defined benefit section of the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
The Companys contributions to the defined contribution section of the pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis as they become payable.
xi Derivative financial instruments derivatives Derivatives are classified as current assets or liabilities when they are deemed to be held for trading.
Derivatives are classified as non-current assets or liabilities where a hedge relationship is identified and the remaining maturity of the hedged item is greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Fair values are derived from market values.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Hedge accounting The Companys activities expose it primarily to the financial risks associated with changes in interest rates.
The Company uses derivatives such as interest rate swaps to hedge these risks.
The Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
Where hedge accounting is to be applied, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting.
130 DSG international plc Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued a Accounting policies continued The accounting treatment of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting is dependent on how they are designated.
The designations and accounting treatments applicable to the Company are explained below: Fair value hedges The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised liabilities.
Derivatives that meet the fair value hedging requirements are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with corresponding fair value movements recognised within interest in the income statement.
For an effective fair value hedge, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the income statement.
To the extent that the designated hedge relationship is fully effective, the amounts in the income statement offset each other.
As a result, only the ineffective element of any designated hedging relationship impacts the income statement.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item for which the effective interest method is used, is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity.
xii Cash flow statement As permitted by FRS 1 Revised 1996 Cash flow statements, the Company has not prepared a cash flow statement because it has already produced a consolidated cash flow statement which is publicly available.
b Directors and auditors remuneration Details of directors remuneration, share interests, share options, pensions and other entitlements, which form part of these financial statements, are given in the parts of the directors Remuneration Report which are described as having been audited.

l Post retirement benefits DSG international plc maintains a pension scheme for eligible employees in the UK comprising both a defined benefit and defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
The last valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2007, using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level of funding to the scheme.
The last actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section showed the value of assets to be sufficient to cover 92% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
At 3 May 2008, the valuation of the defined benefit section for the purposes of FRS 17 showed a gross pension deficit of 51.0 million 28 April 2007 38.4 million.
Further particulars of the scheme are disclosed in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements, which although presented under IAS 19 Employment Benefits show figures and disclosures equivalent to those applicable under FRS 17.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the pension scheme has been closed to new entrants.
Membership of the defined contribution section is now offered to eligible employees.
m Related parties The Company has applied the exemption allowed by FRS 8 regarding disclosure of transactions with other undertakings which are members of the DSG international plc Group.
