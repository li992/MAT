Annual Report and Accounts 2008 69 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15 Intangible assets continued Intangible assets included in continuing operations Goodwill relates to the consideration exceeding the fair value of net assets of the acquisitions of statutory entities including the deferred tax liability arising on statutory licence acquisitions.
Licences comprises the cost of acquired betting shop licences.
The acquired betting shop licences are not amortised as they are considered to have an indefinite life for a combination of reasons: Ladbrokes is a leading operator in well-established markets: there is a proven, sustained demand for bookmaking services: and existing law acts to restrict entry.
Ladbrokes has a very strong track record of renewing its betting permits and licences at minimal cost.
Software relates to the cost of software acquisition and the capitalised costs in respect of internally generated software.
Customer relationships relate to contracted relationships acquired as part of a business combination.
16 Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets The Group tests annually for impairment and at each reporting date if there are indications that goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired, by comparing the carrying amounts of these assets with their recoverable amounts being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Goodwill is tested for impairment by allocating its carrying amount to groups of cash generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination: if the recoverable amount of a group of CGUs exceeds its carrying amount, the group and any goodwill allocated to that group would be regarded as not impaired.
Goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2008 2007 m m Goodwill UK and Other European Retail 54.4 48.3 Casino 10.7 During 2008, following the decision not to expand the casino operation, an impairment charge of 7.5 million was recognised.
The remaining goodwill of 3.2 million has been transferred to the assets held in the disposal group see note 14.
Licences have been allocated to the individual UK and Other European Retail CGUs that are expected to benefit from the assets.
The carrying value of licences at 31 December 2008 was 579.0 million 2007: 410.5 million.
Customer relationships of 40.5 million 2007: 40.5 million have been allocated to a cash generating unit within the eGaming segment.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These are based on budgets approved by management for the next five years, extrapolated thereafter using a 2.5% growth rate 2007: 2.5%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The key assumptions taken into account by management are its cash flow projections and the discount rate applied.
The cash flow projections are based upon historic experience, managements best estimate of future trends and performance and taking account of industry sources.
The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10.3% 2007:10.3%.
The recoverable amount of the UK and Other European Retail estate is considerably in excess of its carrying amount.
The recoverable amount of individual CGUs is sensitive to changes in cash flows or discount rate, although there would need to be a significant change in the cash flow projections or the discount rate before a material impairment charge would be required.
For example, a reduction in projected cash flows of 20% and an increase of 2% in the discount rate would not lead to an impairment.

The Group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 510.4 million at 31 December 2008 2007: 558.6 million.
The expiry profile of these is as follows: 2008 2007 m m In more than two years but no more than five years 510.4 558.6 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups treasury function provides a centralised service for the provision of finance and the management and control of liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rates.
The function operates as a cost centre and manages the Groups treasury exposures to reduce risk in accordance with policies approved by the Board.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, overdrafts, loan notes, bonds, financial guarantee contracts, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables and accruals that arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to assist in the management of the Groups financial risk and to generate the desired effective currency and interest rate profile.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken other than betting and gaming transactions.
The Group has a 2 billion Euro Medium Term Note EMTN programme that is used to increase the flexibility of funding with regards to source, cost, size and maturity.
At 31 December 2008, two public Eurobond issues remained under this programme, a 464.5 million following the repayment of 35.5 million in December 2008 6.5% bond maturing July 2009 and a 250 million 7.125% bond, maturing July 2012.
Several loan notes have also been issued under the programme in a variety of currencies.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had one remaining loan note with a carrying value of 19.4 million.
Funds raised via the EMTN programme have been used to repay bank debt.
The main financial risks for the Group are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest bearing loans and borrowings and on cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups policy for the year ended 31 December 2008 was to maintain a minimum of 25% of net debt at fixed interest rates 2007: 25% so that it was less sensitive to movements in variable short-term interest rates.
At 31 December 2008, after taking account of interest rate and cross currency swaps, 451.3 million 2007: 268.5 million of the Groups gross borrowings were at fixed rates.
Foreign currency risk The Group carries out operations through a number of foreign enterprises.
The day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currencies.
The Groups exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is monitored and reviewed regularly.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of its structural currency exposure arising from the translation of foreign currency assets through Euro drawings under its committed facilities.
These facilities were used to provide an economic hedge of the Groups exposure until 1 July 2008, since which date they have been formally documented as part of the Groups net investment hedging structure.
The Group has foreign currency borrowings, including a 464.5 million bond, some of which have been swapped into sterling.
The total carrying value of these borrowings at 31 December 2008 was 593.3 million 2007: 414.7 million, of which 475.0 million 2007: 385.1 million was swapped into sterling.
76 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Any changes to credit terms are assessed and authorised by senior management on an individual basis.
The Groups Telephone Betting division incurs a level of High Rollers betting activity.
High Rollers are individuals who place sizeable stakes.
The Group manages this activity and the associated risk exposure by utilising senior management expertise and setting maximum levels in respect of stakes placed.
Of the 4.5 million 2007: 72.6 million trade receivables balance, 3.7 million 2007: 71.2 million relates to the Groups Telephone Betting division.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and a loan to a joint venture, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is managed by restricting those transactions to banks that have a defined minimum credit rating and by setting an exposure ceiling per bank.
The Group also has exposure to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contracts provided by the Group.
This risk is partly mitigated by the indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation for any loss incurred in connection with these guarantees.
For further details of these guarantees refer to note 27.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility, through the use of borrowings with a range of maturities.
The Groups policy on liquidity is to ensure that there are sufficient medium-term and long-term committed borrowing facilities to meet the medium-term funding requirements.
At 31 December 2008, there were undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 510.4 million 2007: 558.6 million.
Total committed facilities had an average maturity of 2.8 years 2007: 2.9 years.
The Group intends to repay the 464.5 million 6.5% bond, maturing July 2009, using its existing borrowing facilities.

Other than betting and gaming transactions, the Group does not hold any financial instruments for trading purposes.
The fair value of cash at bank and in hand approximates to book value due to its short-term maturity.
The amortised cost of bank loans approximates to fair value.
Financial guarantee contracts The Group has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division.
The Group received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation HHC, at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Group may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees.
The maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees is 943.1 million 2007: 1,228.1 million, with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount.
Included in the maximum liability exposure is 528.5 million 2007: 539.9 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 414.6 million 2007: 688.2 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Group has entered.
These guarantees expire between 2009 and 2042 and the net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2008 is 430.1 million 2007: 635.8 million.
Included in the net present value of the maximum exposure is 219.1 million 2007: 227.1 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 211.0 million 2007: 408.7 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Group monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations.
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.
The financial guarantee asset has been valued on a similar basis to the liability, taking account of the credit profile of the counter party, HHC, to assess the likelihood of HHC continuing to be solvent at the time of any future potential claim under the indemnity.
At 31 December 2008 the Group has recognised a financial liability of 9.0 million 2007: 10.0 million in respect of these guarantees together with a financial asset of nil 2007: 3.0 million in relation to the indemnity.

The fixed rate bonds and the interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
b At 31 December 2008, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place that had an impact of switching 199.0 million of bank debt from floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.
The floating rate bank debt and the interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than six months.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

b At 31 December 2007, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place that had an impact of switching 19.0 million of bank debt from floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.
c During December 2007, the Group entered into further interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows of 180.0 million of bank borrowings with effect from 29 July 2008.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Sensitivity analysis Foreign currencies The Group has foreign exchange exposure to the Euro and the US Dollar, arising from foreign currency assets.
The impact of a 10% and a 20% movement in the exchange rates between sterling and these currencies is shown below: Profit before tax Equity 2008 2007 2008 2007 Effect on: m m m m Euro 10% movement in the exchange rate 4.0 6.4 4.9 20% movement in the exchange rate 7.6 12.9 9.0 US Dollar 10% movement in the exchange rate 6.9 20% movement in the exchange rate 13.8 The impact on equity relates primarily to unhedged foreign exchange exposure arising on translation of the net assets of foreign subsidiaries.
The fair values of net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements.
Based on the hedging instruments in place at the year end, a 10% increase decrease in the value of the Euro while all other market rates remain constant would lead to a fair value gain loss of 11.8 million 2007: nil.
These movements would be recognised in equity and their post-tax amount offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries.
These sensitivities have been calculated before adjusting for tax.
80 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 27 Financial instruments continued Interest rates The Groups policy is to maintain a minimum of 25% of net debt at fixed interest rates and is therefore sensitive to movements in variable short-term interest rates.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this movement is applied to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.
Profit before tax Equity 2008 2007 2008 2007 Effect on: m m m m 100 basis points increase 6.4 6.2 0.5 200 basis points increase 12.7 12.5 1.0 100 basis points decrease 6.4 6.2 0.5 200 basis points decrease 12.7 12.5 1.0 Sensitivity has been estimated by applying the basis points movement to the carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities held by the Group at the year end.
Hedging activities Hedging of net investments in foreign operations The Group has designated its committed Euro borrowings facility as a partial hedge of the net investments in its European subsidiaries from 1 July 2008.
These facilities comprised an economic hedge of the Groups foreign net investments prior to that date.
At 31 December 2008, foreign currency borrowings of 117.6 million 2007: nil and foreign exchange swap contracts with a nominal value of 0.1 million 2007: nil have been designated as net investment hedges in respect of the currency translation risk arising on foreign operations.
Pre-tax losses of 17.8 million 2007: nil post-tax losses of 12.8 million 2007: nil arising on the translation of these borrowings have been deferred in reserves.
The Group continued to hold and enter into foreign exchange swaps and cross currency swaps that do not qualify as net investment hedges under IAS 39 but that are economic hedges of the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
The fair value of the Groups cross currency swaps is an asset of 109.1 million 2007: 1.2 million.
The fair value of the Groups foreign exchange swaps is an asset of 2.8 million 2007: 29.0 million Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its fair value exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings by swapping borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates in accordance with the policy of the Group.
Contracts with nominal values of 451.0 million 2007: 542.6 million have fixed interest receipts and floating interest payments based on EURIBOR and LIBOR.
The contracts are outstanding for periods up until 2009.
The fair value of these swaps at 31 December 2008 is an asset of 4.7 million 2007: asset of 3.3 million.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its cash flow exposure.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had contracts for interest rate swaps with nominal values of 199.0 million maturing between June 2011 and January 2012.
These contracts have floating rate receipts and fixed rate payables and contracts with a nominal value of 180.0 million took effect on 29 July 2008.
The fair value at 31 December 2008 was a liability of 11.2 million 2007: liability of 1.0 million that has been deferred in equity.
There is no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement arising from cash flow hedges.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure net debt and equity see notes 28 and 30 for further details and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital using a net debt to EBITDA ratio.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008 83 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 Employee share ownership plans The Ladbrokes Share Ownership Trust LSOT is used in connection with the Companys Deferred Bonus Plan and the Restricted Share Plan the Plans.
The LSOT may also be used in connection with the Companys other share-based plans, including the Ladbrokes plc International Share Option Scheme.
The trustee of the LSOT, Computershare Trustees CI Limited, purchases the Companys shares in the open market, as required, on the basis of regular reviews of the anticipated liabilities of the Group, with financing provided by the Company.
Under the Plans, awards of shares are made either in the form of conditional shareholdings or nil priced options for certain non-UK executives once the bonuses for the year ending 31 December have been finalised.
Awards made under the Deferred Bonus Plan will vest two years or three years in respect of awards made from 2008 onwards to executive directors and certain senior executives after the award date.
Awards made under the Restricted Share Plan will vest in their entirety after three years employees can elect for 50% of the award to vest after two years.
Shares in the LSOT have been conditionally gifted to employees.
Shares are forfeited by employees who leave, other than for specified reasons, within the vesting period.
All expenses of the LSOT are settled directly by the Company and charged in the financial statements as incurred.
The Ladbrokes Share Incentive Plan LSIP is currently used in connection with the Companys OWN share plan the OWN plan and Freeshare share plan Freeshare.

Defined benefit plans The Groups only significant defined benefit retirement plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan which is a final salary pension plan for UK employees.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group.
Although the Group is responsible for the operation of this arrangement, professional advisers are appointed to assist the trustees in running it.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 September 2007.
The results of the actuarial valuation were updated to 31 December 2008 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method, as required by IAS 19.
During 2007, the sale of the Vernons Pools business was announced.
Vernons Pools Limited is a participating employer in the Ladbrokes Pension Plan and contributed 0.1 million during 2007, with contributions ceasing with effect from 30 November 2007 for those employees affected by the sale that have now ceased to participate in the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.
The liabilities in respect of the affected individuals have been retained in the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Present value of funded obligations 196.5 208.5 Fair value of plan assets 217.3 242.1 Net asset 20.8 33.6 Amounts in the balance sheet Liabilities Assets 20.8 33.6 Net asset 20.8 33.6 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Analysis of amounts charged to staff costs Current service cost excluding employee element continuing operations 4.0 4.5 discontinued operations 0.1 Interest on obligation continuing operations 12.2 10.8 Expected return on plan assets continuing operations 13.9 14.2 Gains on curtailments and settlements continuing operations 1.0 Total expense recognised in the income statement in staff costs continuing operations 2.3 0.1 discontinued operations 0.1 The actual return on plan assets over the year was a loss of 23.6 million 2007: a gain of 11.2 million.
The amount recognised outside the income statement but in the statement of recognised income and expense SORIE for 2008 is a loss of 16.5 million 2007: gain of 5.1 million.
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the SORIE at 31 December 2008 is a loss of 31.3 million 2007: loss of 14.8 million.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 85 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 33 Retirement benefit schemes continued Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Opening defined benefit obligation 208.5 208.1 Current service cost excluding employee element 4.0 4.6 Contributions by plan members 1.5 1.5 Interest cost 12.2 10.8 Gains on curtailments 1.0 Actuarial gains 21.0 8.1 Benefits paid 8.7 7.4 Closing defined benefit obligation 196.5 208.5 Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Opening defined benefit asset 242.1 230.7 Expected return 13.9 14.2 Actuarial losses 37.5 3.0 Contributions by sponsoring companies 6.0 6.1 Contributions by plan members 1.5 1.5 Benefits paid 8.7 7.4 Closing defined benefit asset 217.3 242.1 The Group expects to contribute 7.4 million to its defined benefit plan in 2009.
The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets are as follows: 2008 2007 Equity instruments % 39.0 50.0 Debt instruments % 61.0 50.0 100.0 100.0 Principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date expressed as weighted averages where appropriate : 2008 2007 % pa % pa Discount rate 6.4 5.9 Expected return on plan assets 5.7 6.1 Future salary growth 3.8 plus 6.2 promotional scale Price inflation 2.8 3.2 Future pension increases LPI 5% 2.6 3.1 LPI 3% 2.4 2.6 LPI 2.5% 2.1 2.2 The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the long-term expected rates of return on each of the major asset classes invested in, weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes over the long term.
The sources used to determine the best estimate of long-term returns include bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations.
At 31 December 2008, the long-term expected rate of return on equity instruments, debt instruments and other assets was assumed to be 7.4% pa, 4.1% pa and 3.8% pa, respectively, for the plan.
The equivalent assumptions at 31 December 2007 were 7.6% pa, 4.6% pa and 4.4% pa respectively.
86 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 33 Retirement benefit schemes continued The post retirement mortality assumed for most members is based on the standard PNA00 mortality table with medium cohort projection, which takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reflect plan specific experience.
The assumption used implies that the expected future lifetime of members aged 65 in 2008 is 85.7 years for males and 87.7 years for females.
For members with large pensions a longer lifetime is assumed 89.1 for males and 90.9 for females.
The post retirement mortality assumption has been updated since 2007 when expected future lifetimes were generally assumed to be 85.0 years for males aged 65 and 87.9 years for females, with longer lifetimes assumed for members with large pensions of 88.6 years for males and 91.7 years for females.
Changes to the assumptions will impact the amounts recognised in the balance sheet and the income statement in respect of the plan.
For the significant assumptions, the following sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact for the year ended 31 December 2008, excluding the impact on the associated deferred tax items: 2008 2007 m m 0.5% pa decrease in the discount rate would have the following approximate effect: Decrease in the balance sheet asset at 31 December 17.3 18.4 This ignores the potential positive impact that a general fall in bond yields may have on the value of the bond assets held by the plan.
0.5% pa decrease in the previous years discount rate would have decreased the 2008 service cost by 0.6 million 2007: 0.8 million.
1.0% pa decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have the following approximate effect: Increase in the amount charged to staff costs 2.2 2.2 one year increase in life expectancy would have the following approximate effect: Increase in the current service cost excluding employee element 0.1 0.1 Decrease in the balance sheet asset at 31 December 3.9 5.0 0.5% pa increase in price inflation would have the following approximate effect: Increase in the current service cost excluding employee element 0.4 0.5 Decrease in the balance sheet asset at 31 December 11.5 10.2 Amounts for the current year and the prior four years are as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 m m m m m Defined benefit obligation 196.5 208.5 208.1 500.8 419.2 Plan assets 217.3 242.1 230.7 357.3 290.6 Surplus deficit 20.8 33.6 22.6 143.5 128.6 Experience loss on plan liabilities 1.7 5.8 3.0 0.3 Experience loss gain on plan assets 37.5 3.0 8.9 34.2 7.3 34 Share-based payments Ladbrokes plc has a performance share plan, an approved and an unapproved share option plan, a sharesave, a share incentive plan, a restricted share plan and an annual bonus plan.
The plans and the various performance conditions are discussed in more detail below.
All of the plans listed below are equity settled share-based payment plans.
i Annual bonus compulsory and voluntary deferral into shares An award under the bonus plan will vest for each annual bonus year as set out below.
2008 For certain senior executives, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment, after three years.
For other employees, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment, after two years.
2007 For certain senior executives, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment, after three years.
For other employees, half of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment, after two years.
2006 Half of the gross annual bonus was delivered in shares that vested, subject to continued employment, after two years.
2005 Where a participant earned a bonus and further Group performance criteria were met, participants were invited to invest up to 25% of the value of their total bonus in Ladbrokes plc shares that were then held for three years.
The Group matched any percentage up to the 25% maximum voluntarily invested by a participant.
The matching shares vested after three years, subject to continued employment and the participant continuing to hold the shares purchased by their voluntary investment.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 87 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 34 Share-based payments continued ii Sharesave related share options scheme This is a sharesave scheme with options granted at a 20% discount to market value.
The scheme operates with either a three or five years saving with vesting after this time.
iii Share incentive plan a Under the OWN plan, employees can contribute up to 75 per month to acquire Ladbrokes plc shares.
For every two shares purchased, the Group provides a match of one additional share.
b Under the Freeshares plan, an award of up to 250 in value is made to participating employees on reaching one years service.
iv Share options The options granted are all market value options with a three year vesting period.
Vested options lapse if they have not been exercised within ten years of the date of grant.
All options have an EPS growth based performance condition.
v Restricted plan An award under the Restricted plan will vest in its entirety after three years.
However, employees can elect for 50% of the award to vest after two years.
vi Performance share plan PSP An award under the PSP consists of a conditional allocation of shares that will vest, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, at the end of the three year period.
The performance conditions are set out below.
2005 awards The vested 2005 awards had two separate performance conditions: half of the award vested based on TSR and half of the award vested based on operating profit growth.
2006 awards The 2006 awards have two separate performance conditions: half of the award vests based on TSR and half of the award vests based on operating profit growth.
2007 and 2008 awards The 2007 and 2008 awards have two separate performance conditions: half of the award vests based on TSR and half of the award vests based on EPS.

The Group recognised an expense of 3.2 million 2007: 6.4 million relating to equity settled share-based payment transactions.
Share awards granted during the year: 2008 2007 Number 1,159,385 1,047,786 Weighted average fair value 3.18 4.04 The fair value of share awards was measured by calculating the present value of the dividends receivable between the grant date and the vesting date and valuing the market-related performance conditions through the use of a closed-form model, similar to a Monte Carlo simulation.
35 Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments Group as lessee The Group has a number of lease agreements that, pursuant to their economic substance, qualify as non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
These primarily relate to rents payable on land and buildings.
The terms of the leases vary significantly but can broadly be summarised as follows: Lease terms Shop leases are typically 15 years with a tenant only break clause at 10 years and rent reviews every five years.
Other leases are typically between three and 10 years.
Determination of rent payments Rent payments are based on the amount specified in the agreement.
Terms of renewal The agreements are not terminated automatically after expiry of the lease term and in the majority of cases, lease extension options have been agreed upon and in many other cases, there will be an opportunity to negotiate lease extensions with the lessor.
Restrictions There are no restrictions imposed upon the Group, concerning dividends, additional debt or further leasing under any of the existing lease arrangements, although there were occasionally non-financial restrictions on leases preventing the Group from opening or operating another competing hotel for a specified number of years.
Subleases The Group does sublease areas of leased properties and receives sublease payments from third parties.
