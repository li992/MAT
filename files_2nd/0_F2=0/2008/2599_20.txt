13 Risk management and financial instruments Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Group monitors the return on average capital employed as well as the level of total shareholders equity and the amount of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the return on average capital employed was 57.3% 2007: 60.9%, the level of total shareholders equity at 31 December 2008 was 612.6m 2007: 476.2m and the amount of dividends paid in the year ended 31 December 2008 was 59.9m 2007: 56.2m.
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of shareholders equity and bank and capital market borrowings.
All of the borrowings are managed by a central treasury function and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries as required.
The overall objective is to manage the funding to ensure the Group has a portfolio of competitively priced borrowing facilities to meet the demands of the business over time and, in order to do so, arranges a mixture of borrowings from different sources with a variety of maturity dates.
The Groups businesses provide a high and consistent level of cash generation, which helps fund future development and growth.
The Group seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year and the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Treasury policies and controls The Group has a centralised treasury department to control external borrowings and manage liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of financial instruments that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
The Group uses derivatives to manage its foreign currency and interest rate risks arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury department is subject to periodic independent review by the internal audit department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the executive directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place.
Hedge accounting The Group designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either a a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: b a hedge of the cash flow risk resulting from changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates: or c a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
The accounting treatment for hedges is set out in the financial instruments accounting policy in Note 2.
The Group tests the effectiveness of hedges on a prospective and retrospective basis to ensure compliance with IAS 39.
Methods for testing effectiveness include dollar offset, critical terms and regression analysis.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group continually monitors net debt and forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient facilities are in place to meet the Groups requirements in the short, medium and long term and, in order to do so, arranges a mixture of borrowings from different sources.
Additionally, compliance with biannual debt covenants is monitored on a monthly basis based on the management accounts.
Sensitivity analyses using various scenarios are applied to forecasts to assess their impact on covenants and net debt.
During 2008 all covenants have been complied with and based on current forecasts it is expected that such covenants will continue to be complied with for the foreseeable future.
The Group is funded by multi-currency credit facilities from the Groups bankers and US dollar bonds and the Group has substantial borrowing facilities available to it.
At 31 December 2008, the total US dollar bonds outstanding were $535m with maturities ranging from 2009 to 2018.
The bank facilities mature between December 2010 and March 2013.
At 31 December 2008 the available bank facilities totalled 767.0m of which 524.9m was drawn down.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Expiring within one year 15.7 Expiring after one year but within two years 97.6 Expiring after two years 144.5 200.0 242.1 215.7 In addition the Group maintains overdraft and uncommitted facilities to provide short term flexibility.
The contractual maturity profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December is set out on page 24.
The amounts disclosed on page 24 are the undiscounted cash flows and therefore include interest cash flows forecast using LIBOR interest rates at 31 December in the case of non-fixed rate financial liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments of 44.4m 2007: 11.3m have been included within the tables since they predominantly relate to derivatives which are used to manage the interest cash flows on the Groups debt.
Bank loans have been drawn under committed facilities and can be refinanced on maturity from these same facilities.
Accordingly they have been aged based on the maturity dates of the underlying facilities.
At 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 there were no loans secured by either fixed or floating charges on the Groups assets.

The fair values of financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value have been calculated by discounting cash flows at the prevailing interest rates.
The value of the US dollar bonds would be 368.2m 2007: 281.4m if the movement in credit spreads in 2008 was taken into account.
Fair value gains and losses on the interest rate caps and the time value of interest rate collars impact the income statement whilst all other financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value are in hedging relationships.
24 Notes Bunzl plc Directors Report and Accounts 2008 13 Risk management and financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Groups debt is effectively held at floating interest rates since the US dollar bonds have been swapped to floating rates using interest rate swaps.
Bank loans are drawn for various periods at interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Interest rate caps and interest rate collars are in place to reduce the Groups resultant floating rate exposure to movements in LIBOR and thereby protect the Groups interest charge against material adverse movements in interest rates.
The interest rate swaps are in fair value hedge relationships with the market risk of the US dollar bonds.
These hedges were effective during the year ended 31 December 2008 and have therefore had no net impact on the income statement since changes in the fair values of the hedged items and hedging instruments are of the same amount and offset each other in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge accounting is applied to the intrinsic value of the interest rate collars.
For the year ended 31 December 2008 all collar cash flow hedges were effective with a loss of 6.4m 2007: 1.3m recognised in equity.
This will affect the income statement during the year ending 31 December 2009 and the year ending 31 December 2010.
Hedge accounting is not applied to the interest rate caps or to the time value of the interest rate collars.
The interest rate swaps had a notional principal of 371.5m outstanding at 31 December 2008 2007: 268.8m.
The floating interest rate is based on US dollar LIBOR repricing every three months.
Financial liabilities with a notional principal of 517.6m were capped at 31 December 2008 2007: 193.0m.
The interest rate is based on US dollar and euro LIBOR repricing every three months.
The interest rate collars have been entered into to manage the interest rate risk on US dollar borrowings with a notional principal of 69.4m in the year ended 31 December 2008 and 208.3m in the year ending 31 December 2009.
After taking account of hedge relationships, a change of 1% in the interest rate forward curves on 31 December would have the effects set out below as a result of changes in the fair values of derivatives at that date: Impact on profit before tax Impact on equity 1% 1% 1% 1% m m m m 2008 0.8 0.1 2.8 2.2 2007 1.0 0.2 2.4 1.8 Foreign currency risk The majority of the Groups borrowings were effectively denominated in US dollars and euros until the latter part of 2008.
As a result of the increased volatility in the foreign exchange markets towards the year end, the Group converted the majority of this debt into sterling in order to limit the impact of foreign exchange on the level of net debt.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had 255.9m of debt denominated in foreign currencies.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the respective functional currencies of the Groups operations and so transaction exposures are limited.
However where they do occur the Groups policy is to hedge significant exposures of firm commitments for a period of up to one year as soon as they are committed using forward foreign exchange contracts and these are designated as cash flow hedges.
For the year ended 31 December 2008 all foreign exchange cash flow hedges were effective with a 1.5m gain recognised in equity 2007: 0.2m.
This will affect the income statement for the year ending 31 December 2009.
The following significant exchange rates applied during and at the end of the year: Average rate Closing rate 2008 2007 2008 2007 US dollar 1.85 2.00 1.44 1.99 Euro 1.26 1.46 1.03 1.36 If a 10% strengthening or weakening of sterling had taken place on 31 December it would have increased decreased profit before tax and equity for the year by the amounts shown below.
The impact of this translation exposure is much greater on equity than it is on profit before tax since equity is translated using the closing exchange rates and profit before tax is translated using the average exchange rates for the year.
As a result the value of equity is more sensitive than the amount of profit before tax to a movement in exchange rates on 31 December and the resulting movement in profit before tax is due to the translation effect on monetary items.
Following the conversion of the majority of the Groups borrowings into sterling towards the end of 2008, the impact of this translation exposure on the US dollar and euro denominated assets and liabilities is much greater than it would otherwise have been.
For this reason the impact on equity is much greater in 2008 than in 2007.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
