These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
As the Groups operations are entirely UK based, the Group does not present any secondary segment information.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to segments as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated corporate items comprise mainly interest bearing loans and borrowings.
There are no inter-segment sales.
