27 Catalogue costs: voluntary accounting policy change In its Annual Improvement Update issued in February 2008, the IASB proposed amendments to IAS38, Intangible assets.
These would require an entity to recognise an expense in respect of advertising and promotional activities when it receives services or, in the case of a supply of goods, when it receives access to those goods.
In addition, the IASB proposed that catalogues are a form of advertising.
In light of these proposals, the Directors have decided to make a voluntary change to their current accounting policy to write off costs relating to the production and printing of catalogues to the income statement as they are incurred.
In prior periods, the adopted policy was to recognise these costs as the catalogues were distributed to customers.
In applying the new policy retrospectively, the Directors have reclassified unused paper stocks to be used for printing catalogues as inventory and have recognised additional accruals in respect of certain catalogue costs that would have been prepaid under the previous accounting policy but are expensed as incurred under the new policy.
The impact of the change in accounting policy to distribution and marketing costs and profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2008 is nil the 2007 impact is to reduce distribution and marketing costs and increase profit before tax by 2.0m, together with a nil effect to the income tax expense 2007 impact is to increase the income tax charge by 0.6m.
The change had no effect on basic earnings per share in 2008, 0.3p increase in basic earnings per share in 2007.
The change has also reduced the foreign exchange translation income through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense by 0.5m for the year ended 31 March 2008 2007 impact is to reduce the foreign exchange translation cost by 0.3m.
The change reduced trade and other receivables as at 1 April 2006 by 8.4m, at 31 March 2007 by 7.4m and at 31 March 2008 by 8.5m.
The current and net deferred tax liability decreased at 1 April 2006 by 2.8m, at 31 March 2007 by 2.1m and at 31 March 2008 by 2.3m.
In addition, reclassifications increased inventories and accruals at 1 April 2006 by 1.9m and 3.3m respectively and increased inventories by 0.4m at 31 March 2008.
In aggregate, the change reduced net assets at 1 April 2006 by 7.0m, 31 March 2007 by 5.3m and 31 March 2008 by 5.8m.
The restatement has no affect on the Groups operating or free cash flow in either year.
