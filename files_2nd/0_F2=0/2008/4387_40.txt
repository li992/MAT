Intangible assets The movements during the year were as follows: Exploration and Evaluation Goodwill Assets Total 000 000 000 Cost and Net Book Value: At 1 January 2007 97,082 97,082 Arising on acquisition 122,714 20,355 143,069 Exchange adjustments 8,136 1,166 9,302 Additions 69,760 69,760 Unsuccessful exploration and evaluation 12,691 12,691 Disposals 3,275 3,275 At 31 December 2007 Restated 130,850 172,397 303,247 Transfers and reclassifications 26,729 26,729 Exchange adjustments 24,130 11,718 35,848 Additions 105,378 105,378 Unsuccessful exploration and evaluation 29,852 29,852 At 31 December 2008 154,980 232,912 387,892 77 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2008 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 11.
Intangible assets continued Exploration and Evaluation Additions to exploration and evaluation assets represent the ongoing execution of the underlying work programmes and the fulfilment of individual licence requirements.
During the year, following completion of geotechnical evaluation activity, certain licences were either relinquished or are in the process of being relinquished, and declared unsuccessful.
Accordingly the related licence expenditures were expensed.
During 2008, the principal exploration write-offs were Morocco NW Safi, Fiacre Block 23 11 N, Norway PL311 and Norway PL 329 2007: Mauritania Block 8, Kenya L5, Clochnaben in the UK and the GAB acreage in Australia.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is described more fully in note 30 Acquisition of Subsidiaries, on pages 99 to 101.
The Group has one class of business, the exploration for and production of hydrocarbons liquids and gas: and has determined that this primary business segment will be used, for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill arising on business combinations on an annual basis as it is currently the lowest level that goodwill is reviewed by the Board.
Value in use: key assumptions The recoverable amount of the primary business segment is determined by value in use calculations which measure the net present value at the reporting date of the anticipated cash flow projections from each individual asset which comprise the portfolio underpinning the business segment.
Life of field cash flow projections are used for development and producing assets, applying generally accepted market assumptions for commodity price and future inflation.
For exploration assets a risked valuation is used which combines an assessment of the expected chance of commercial success and likely development cost.
Value attributable to exploration from the Groups extensive exploration portfolio, is derived from two sources: one, being the market value of existing discoveries which have established the presence of hydrocarbons, but where further appraisal activity is required, and the other, being the economic monetary value of the future drilling portfolio taking account of geological risking less the expected pre-tax exploration cost: in both cases, using valuation multiples in line with precedent transactions.
The risk adjusted cash flows are then discounted at 12% Note that Egypt assets are discounted at 8% as pre-tax and post-tax cash flow are the same.
The calculation of value in use for the segment is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Commodity price Production volumes Exchange rates Discount rates Operating costs Capital costs 78 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2008 11.
Intangible assets continued Commodity prices reflect a market view of future prices.
Wood Mackenzie was used as an independent source of such prices, which for oil were: 2009 $64 boe, 2010 $75 boe, 2011 $73 boe rising 2.5% annually thereafter and for gas: 2009 66p therm, 2010 65p therm, 2011 57p therm, rising 2.5% annually thereafter.
From a review of other market price forecasts, Wood Mackenzie was considered in the median range of such forecasts.
Life of field production profiles are estimated for each individual asset within the Group development and production portfolio by the technical management team.
Operating costs and capital costs are estimated using information from either the operator for non-operated assets or the technical management team for operated assets.
No annual inflation factor has been applied.
The year end foreign exchange rates were used for the calculations which were: USD GBP 1.4378 NOK GBP 10.0673 Euro GBP 1.0344 The excess of the recoverable amount of the D&P assets over the carrying value of the segment is 526.4 million.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions There are possible changes to the key assumptions above which might be considered reasonably likely and cause the carrying value of the segment to exceed its recoverable amount.
Commodity price the Board has considered the possibility of lower than planned oil and gas prices.
A reduction in oil price to $38 per barrel would be required before value in use, as defined above, was reduced to a value equal to its carrying amount.
Production volumes the Board recognises that production profiles may be adjusted at each future reserves estimate review.
An across-the-board reduction of 57% in production accompanied by the Wood Mackenzie prices would be required before value in use, as defined above, was reduced to a value equal to its carrying amount.
Exchange rates the Board has considered the possibility of a significant movement in exchange rates between GBP and USD.
An exchange rate of $3.01 1 would be required before value in use, as defined above, was reduced to a value equal to its carrying amount.
The Board considers that the market capitalisation of the Company is one indicator of the recoverable amount of the business segment including exploration value.
At 31 December 2008 the market capitalisation was 178,489,353 greater than the segment carrying amount.
