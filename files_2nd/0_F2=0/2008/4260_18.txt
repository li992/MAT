CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2009 Continued 47 Financial instruments continued 102 Financial risk management objectives The Group Treasury function provides services to the Company, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Company.
The main risks the Company is exposed to are the currency risk component of market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
Foreign currency risk management The Company does not seek to manage the currency risk component of market risk as these risks are managed on a Group level.
The Company does not enter into any financial derivative contracts.
The Company does not enter into, or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure of the Company to foreign currency movements for its non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
If the US Dollar had strengthened by ten percent against GBP Sterling, the Companys: loss for the 53 week period ended 2 January 2009 would have decreased by $1,017,000.
The loss for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 would have decreased by $1,267,000.
In both periods, this is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to foreign exchange movements on Sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities: there is no impact on other equity reserves 2007: $nil.
A ten percent weakening of the US Dollar against GBP Sterling would have had the equal but opposite effect, on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
A thirty percent strengthening of the US Dollar against GBP as at 2 January 2009 would have had a $3,559,000 decrease in loss for the period and no impact on equity reserves.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change in currency rates given current market conditions.
This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2007.
Although Management believes a ten percent movement is the most representative movement in the US Dollar to GBP Sterling rate, given market conditions, a thirty percent movement has been shown to aid understanding of the Companys market risk.
Interest rate risk management The company has no significant direct exposures to fluctuations in interest rates other than those on interest bearing cash balances.
The majority of cash balances are held at fixed rates of interest and the effective rate of interest on those balances in the period was 4.67% 2007: 5.16%.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparties will default on their contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company.
The Company has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss.
This information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and if not available, the Company uses other publicity available financial information and trading records.
For cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits, the Company only transacts with entities that are equivalent to investment grade and above.
Other financial assets consist of amounts receivable from related parties.
The Companys exposure to significant concentration of credit risk on receivables from related parties is detailed in note 48.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for the liquidity risk management of the Company rests with the Board of Directors which manages the liquidity requirements of the Company in terms of short, medium and long-term funding requirements.
