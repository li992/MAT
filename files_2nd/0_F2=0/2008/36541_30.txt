UK REIT TAXATION As a UK REIT, Hammerson plc is exempted from corporation tax on rental income and gains on UK investment properties but is required to pay Property Income Distributions PIDs.
UK shareholders will be taxed on PIDs received at their full marginal tax rates.
A REIT may in addition pay normal dividends and Hammerson currently expects that its interim dividends will be paid entirely as PIDs while its final dividends will have both a PID and a normal dividend element.
For most shareholders, PIDs will be paid after deducting withholding tax at the basic rate.
However, certain categories of shareholder are entitled to receive PIDs without withholding tax, principally UK resident companies, UK public bodies, UK pension funds and managers of ISAs, PEPs and Child Trust Funds.
Hammersons website includes a form to be used by shareholders to certify if they qualify to receive PIDs without withholding tax.
Further information on UK REITs is available on the Companys website.
CAPITAL GAINS TAX 1982 SHARE VALUE For the purposes of computing capital gains tax, the value of the Companys shares on 31 March 1982, after adjustment for subsequent issues, was 290p for each ordinary share at that date and 315p for each share classified as A ordinary limited voting at that date.
The cost to be used by shareholders in computing the gain on any disposal of shares will, however, vary according to individual circumstances and shareholders should seek professional advice on the amount of tax that may arise.
