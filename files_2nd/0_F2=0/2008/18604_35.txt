The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds.
Pension arrangements for directors are disclosed in the report of the remuneration committee and the directors remuneration report on page 49 of the review section of this document.
The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents contributions payable by the group.
Dened benefit scheme In addition to the above, the group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme, the BPT Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by trustees and are invested with an independent investment manager.
Costs and funding are assessed with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial valuations are carried out every three years and the last full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 1 July 2007.
This scheme was operated by BPT Limited which became a subsidiary of Grainger plc in 2003.
The actuarial valuation as at 1 July 2007 was based on the main actuarial assumptions of an investment return of 6.8% per annum, salary increases of 4.9% per annum and inflation-linked increases to pensions in deferment of 3.4% per annum.
The scheme assets were valued at 17.9m and scheme liabilities at 21.1m, a funding level of 85%.
The funding level for the scheme at the previous valuation as at 1 July 2004 was 79%.
The trustees and the employer have agreed a recovery plan to eliminate the deficit.
This plan will run for seven years with company contributions to the scheme of 48,350 per month, 580,200 per annum.
The actuary also undertook a Section 179 valuation as at 1 July 2007 as required by the Pension Protection Fund.
The funding level on a Section 179 valuation basis was 142%.
The scheme was closed to new members and to employee contributions in 2003.
Accordingly, there is no current service cost for the scheme.
The IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the 1 July 2007 actuarial valuation but have been updated to 30 September 2008 by a qualified independent actuary.
