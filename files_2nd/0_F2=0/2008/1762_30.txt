The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the income statement in the period in which those benefits are earned by the employees.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent the benefits are already vested, or otherwise is recognised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.

2 The increase in foreign exchange gains mainly reflects the exchange gain on an intercompany loan from the UK to the US businesses.
3 The net loss on remeasurement of financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss is principally due to the movement in the US dollar exchange rate on hedges relating to a portion of the intercompany loan from the UK to the US businesses.
4 The increase in foreign exchange losses is mainly due to movements in the Euro exchange rate relating to loans from equity accounted investments, and the revaluation of a loan from the US business to the UK.

2 Amortisation is included in operating costs in the income statement.
3 Adjustment on finalisation of provisional goodwill relating to the acquisition of Armor Holdings, Inc. in 2007.
The amounts are not considered material for the restatement of comparative information.
The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
The Groups approach to goodwill impairment testing is set out in the accounting policies on page 110.
The Groups goodwill of 10.9bn 2007 8.4bn is allocated across 16 cash-generating units.
In order to calculate the recoverable amount of the Groups goodwill, all goodwill balances by cash-generating units have been considered with regard to value in use calculations.
These calculations use risk-adjusted future cash flow projections based on the Groups five-year Integrated Business Plan IBP and include a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with an inflationary growth rate assumption applied.
Pre-tax discount rates derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.19% adjusted for risks specific to each cash-generating unit as appropriate have been used in discounting these projected risk-adjusted cash flows.
The Group has two cash-generating units whose combined allocated goodwill exceeds 40% of the Groups total goodwill balance.
These are both US operations within the Land & Armaments operating group acquired in 2005 and in 2007.
The key assumption underpinning the cash flow projections for these operations is the continued demand in our home markets and from exports for existing and successor military land and tracked vehicles, upgrade programmes and support.
Whilst there are no other cash-generating units with allocated goodwill balances exceeding 20% of the Groups total goodwill balance, the majority of the projected cash flows within the remaining cash-generating units are underpinned by the expected continuation of levels of US government spending on aerospace, defence and security.
Intangible assets continued The directors have not identified any reasonably possible material changes relating either specifically to the global military vehicle market, or to the levels of defence spending in our home markets, particularly in the US, that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
The result of the review of the carrying value of goodwill across the Group is an impairment charge of 54m 2007 148m.
This mainly reflects lower sales volumes in the US-based Products Group business 40m against the 254m total goodwill, which was acquired with Armor Holdings, Inc. in 2007.

BAE Systems Annual Report 2008 135 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 22.
Retirement benefit obligations Pension plans BAE Systems plc operates pension plans for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries.
The principal plans in the UK and US are funded defined benefit plans, and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans in other countries are unfunded or defined contribution plans.
Pension plan valuations are regularly carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding and to calculate the IAS 19 deficit.
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit plans in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the deficit of the plans at 31 December each year.
Plan assets are shown at the bid value at 31 December each year.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
The latest valuations of the principal plans, covering retiree medical and life insurance plans in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2008.
These plans were rolled forward to reflect the information at 31 December 2008.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension plans.
The financial assumptions used to calculate liabilities for the principal plans were: UK US 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 % % % % % % Inflation rate 2.9 3.3 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase in salaries 3.9 4.3 4.0 5.5 5.8 5.8 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.2 3.4 2.3 3.3 2.9 3.0 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.9 3.3 3.0 n a n a n a Discount rate 6.3 5.8 5.2 6.5 6.5 5.9 Long-term healthcare cost increases n a n a n a 5.3 5.4 5.5 The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The bid value of plan assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of plan liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, as at 31 December are shown in the tables below.
For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 31 December 2008, continued to use PA 00 medium cohort tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of plan members.
In addition, this mortality has been subject to a minimum assumed rate of future annual mortality improvements of 1%.
For its US pension arrangements, the mortality tables used for pensioners and non-pensioners are RP 2000 projected to 2010.
The current life expectancies underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the main UK and US plans range from 19 to 23 years for current male pensioners at age 65 and 22 to 25 years for current female pensioners at age 65.
The Group has a number of healthcare arrangements in the US.
The long-term healthcare cost increases shown in the table above are based on the assumptions that the increases are 9% in 2008 reducing to 5% by 2015 for pre-retirement and 10% in 2008 reducing to 5% for post-retirement.
A summary of the movements in the retirement benefit obligations is shown overleaf.
The full disclosures, as required by IAS 19, are provided in the subsequent information.
Retirement benefit obligations continued Additional disclosure summary of movements of the retirement benefit obligations US and UK other Total m m m Deficit in defined benefit pension plans at 1 January 2008 1,908 91 1,999 Transfers arising on acquisitions 8 8 Actual return on assets below expected return 2,956 768 3,724 Decrease increase in liabilities due to changes in assumptions 1,471 38 1,433 One-off contributions 104 104 Recurring contributions in excess of service cost 212 5 217 Exchange translation 240 240 Other movements 13 49 62 Deficit in defined benefit pension plans at 31 December 2008 3,072 1,083 4,155 US healthcare plans 61 61 Total IAS 19 deficit 3,072 1,144 4,216 1 Allocated to equity accounted investments and other participating employers 891 891 Groups share of IAS 19 deficit excluding Groups share of amounts allocated to equity accounted 2,181 1,144 3,325 investments and other participating employers As a result of the recent fall in global stock markets the actual return on assets is below that expected.
The decrease in the liabilities due to changes in assumptions is primarily due to an increase in corporate bond yields which has increased the discount rates used to calculate the liabilities of the pension plans as at 31 December 2008.
Global credit issues have resulted in current corporate bond yields being notably higher than in the recent past.

As these plans are multi-employer plans the Group has allocated an appropriate share of the IAS 19 pension deficit to the equity accounted investments and to Airbus SAS based upon a reasonable and consistent allocation method intended to reflect a reasonable approximation of their share of the deficit.
The Groups share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.

This is consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time.
Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before expected return assumptions are determined for each asset class.
The overall expected return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

Contributions The Group contributions made to the defined benefit plans in the year ended 31 December 2008 were 399m 2007 403m excluding those amounts allocated to equity accounted investments and participating employers 87m.
In 2009, the Group expects to make regular contributions at a similar level to those made in 2008.
In addition, the Group expects to make incremental contributions of 200m in respect of the UK pension schemes and $250m 172m to the US pension schemes in 2009.
The Group incurred a charge in respect of the cash contributions of 84m 2007 62m paid to defined contribution plans for employees.
Following the acquisitions the Group has made in 2008 note 31, it expects to make a contribution of 132m to these plans in 2009.

Aircraft financing The provision includes probable exposures under residual value guarantees issued by the Group on previous sales transactions.
Further information is provided in note 24.
Such costs are generally incurred within five years.
Warranties and after-sales service Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience.
Such costs are generally incurred within three years post-delivery.
Whilst actual events could result in potentially significant differences to the quantum but not the timing of the outflows in relation to the provisions, management has reflected current knowledge in assessing the provision levels and historical evidence indicates that the actual outflows are similar to the amounts provided.
Reorganisations continuing operations The costs associated with the reorganisation programmes are supported by detailed plans and based on previous experience as well as other known factors.
Such costs are generally incurred within one to three years.
There is limited volatility around the timing and amount of the ultimate outflows related to these provisions.
Legal costs, environmental and other provisions The Group holds provisions for expected legal, environmental and other costs that it expects to incur over an extended period.
These costs are based on past experience of similar items and other known factors and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
Included within legal costs, environmental and other is 26m 2007 75m in respect of the cash-settled elements of certain of the Groups share option schemes note 26.
The costs in respect of this liability are expected to occur over the next five years.
Reflecting the inherent uncertainty within many legal proceedings, the timing and amount of the outflows could differ significantly from the amount provided.
BAE Systems Annual Report 2008 141 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 24.
Contingent liabilities and commitments Aircraft financing contingent liabilities Included within the aircraft financing provision of 71m note 23 is an exposure of 58m as discussed below: 2008 2007 m m Potential future cash flow payments in respect of aircraft financing obligations 97 134 Anticipated aircraft values 37 55 Adjustments to net present values 2 9 Net exposure provided 58 70 The Group has provided residual value guarantees RVGs in respect of certain commercial aircraft sold.
At 31 December 2008, the Groups gross exposure to make future payments in respect of these arrangements was 97m 2007 134m.
The Groups net exposure to these guarantees is covered by the provisions held and the residual values of the related aircraft.
The Group is also exposed to actual and contingent liabilities arising from commercial aircraft financing and RVGs given by Saab AB.
Provision is made against the expected net exposures on a net present value basis within the accounts of Saab.
The Groups share of such exposure is limited to its percentage shareholding in Saab.
Guarantees and performance bonds The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business.
Provision is made for any amounts that the directors consider may become payable under such arrangements.
Operating lease commitments where the Group is the lessee The Group leases various offices, factories, shipyards and aircraft under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases and associated future minimum sublease income are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Payments due: Not later than one year 177 125 Later than one year and not later than five years 546 460 Later than five years 679 731 1,402 1,316 Total of future minimum sublease income under non-cancellable subleases 259 249 Capital commitments Capital expenditure contracted for but not provided for in the accounts is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Property, plant and equipment 133 121 Intangible assets 7 6 140 127 Treasury contingent liabilities Treasury contingent liabilities are set out in note 32.
Other contingent liabilities The Group is subject to an ongoing investigation by the UK Serious Fraud Office the SFO in connection with marketing of the Groups products.
The Group is co-operating fully with the SFO.
At this stage management cannot determine whether or not it might lead to any proceedings being brought against the Group.
Accordingly, the potential for fines or other penalties cannot currently be assessed, although the directors continue to consider that the Group has not acted unlawfully in relation to any of the matters under investigation.
As the investigation is ongoing it is not possible to identify the timescale in which these issues might be resolved.
In addition, in June 2007, the US Department of Justice notified the Group that it had commenced a formal investigation relating to the Groups compliance with anti-corruption laws, including its business concerning the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Again, given the status of this matter it is not possible to provide any details of any possible future financial effects that might result from the investigation and any subsequent actions or events that might occur as a result of the investigation.
Equally it is not possible to provide any timescale in which these issues might be resolved.
The directors continue to consider that the Group has not acted unlawfully in relation to its dealings with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or in relation to anti-corruption laws.
Should any financial effects arise as a result of these investigations the directors consider it unlikely that there is any likelihood of reimbursement for such costs from any sources other than certain rights to recover reimbursement of the legal costs under the Groups insurance policies.

Certain parts of the Companys Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special Shareholder.
These articles include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have more than a 15% voting interest in the Company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, the requirement that decisions of the directors at their meetings, in their committees or via resolution must be approved by a majority of British directors and the requirement that the Chief Executive and any executive chairman are British citizens.
The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations made by the directors and approved by the Special Shareholder.
The Special Shareholder may require the Company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into one ordinary voting share.
The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of the Companys shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the Special Share.
Placing of shares On 11 May 2007, 174,418,605 new ordinary shares of 2.5p each were placed at a price of 430p, raising 750m before expenses see note 27.
Conversion of preference shares As at 1 January 2007, the Company had in issue 259,962,909 7.75p net cumulative redeemable preference shares of 25p each.
During the prior year, the shares were converted into ordinary shares of 2.5p each on the basis of 0.47904 ordinary shares for each preference share, as a result of which 124,532,630 ordinary shares of 2.5p each were issued.
There were, therefore, no preference shares in issue as at 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2008.
In accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, the convertible preference shares were considered to be a compound financial instrument consisting of both a debt element and an equity component which required separate accounting treatment.
Following conversion to ordinary shares the amounts previously recognised within equity note 27 and within loans and overdrafts note 20 have been extinguished.
Treasury shares As at 31 December 2008, 55,038,953 2007 61,945,000 ordinary shares of 2.5p each with an aggregate nominal value of 1,375,974 2007 1,548,625 were held in treasury.
During 2008, 6,906,047 treasury shares were used to satisfy awards and options under the Share Incentive Plan and the Save-As-You-Earn Share Option Scheme.

The 1,343m credit to other reserves includes 1,004m to the translation reserve and 339m to the hedging reserve.
Under Section 4 of the British Aerospace Act 1980 the statutory reserve may only be applied in paying up unissued shares of the Group to be allotted to members of the Group as fully paid bonus shares.
Placing of shares On 11 May 2007, 174,418,605 new ordinary shares of 2.5p each were issued by a placing of shares note 25.
The placing structure utilised attracted merger relief under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985, resulting in a credit to the merger reserve of 736m.
Subsequent internal transactions required to complete the placing structure have resulted in this part of the merger reserve being transferred to the retained earnings reserve.
Own shares held Own shares held, including treasury shares and shares held by BAE Systems ESOP Trust, are recognised as a deduction from retained earnings.
Conversion of preference shares During the prior year, 259,962,909 preference shares were converted into ordinary shares of 2.5p each on the basis of 0.47904 ordinary shares for each preference share note 25.
Treasury shares During the prior year, 33,270,000 ordinary shares of 2.5p each were repurchased under the buyback programme announced in October 2006.
BAE Systems ESOP Trust The Group has an ESOP discretionary trust to administer the share plans and to acquire Company shares, using funds loaned by the Group, to meet commitments to Group employees.
A dividend waiver was in operation for shares within the ESOP Trust, other than those owned beneficially by the participants, for the dividends paid in June and December 2008.

Acquisition of subsidiaries The Group acquired MTC Technologies, Inc. MTC in the US on 9 June 2008, Tenix Defence in Australia on 27 June 2008 and Detica Group plc Detica on 25 September 2008.
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2008, combined sales of Group and equity accounted investments would have been 19.0bn, revenue 17.2bn and profit for the year from continuing operations 1.8bn.
MTC On 9 June 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of MTC in the US for a cash consideration including transaction costs of $375m 188m.
Goodwill arising on consolidation is 131m.

In the period from acquisition to 31 December, MTC contributed revenue and loss after tax of 98m and 1m, respectively, to the Groups consolidated results.
The acquisition of MTC complements the existing US business in the Electronics, Intelligence & Support operating group.
It allows for synergies in professional services, aircraft integration centres, and modification and sustainment.
The opportunities presented by these circumstances do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within the Electronics, Intelligence & Support operating group supporting the goodwill.

The acquisition of Tenix Defence complements the existing Australian business enabling BAE Systems to establish a greater presence in the Australian defence market and in particular to expand into the Australian land and marine sectors.
These opportunities do not translate into separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within Tenix Defence supporting the recognised goodwill.
Certain of the accounting policy alignments have not yet been finalised pending further review.
In addition, certain of the fair values assigned to the net assets acquired are provisional.
These will be amended as necessary in light of subsequent knowledge or events to the extent that these reflect conditions as at the date of acquisition.

Acquisition of subsidiaries continued Detica On 25 September 2008, the Groups offer for the acquisition of Detica for 543m including assumption of net debt became wholly unconditional.
Detica is a specialist business and technology consultancy with expertise in information exploitation, security and resilience, threat intelligence and customer insight.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2008, Detica contributed revenue and profit after tax of 60m UK 55m and 1m, respectively, to the Groups consolidated results.
The acquisition of Detica provides access to UK and US government contracting opportunities in the intelligence, security and resilience market and significant cross-selling opportunities, particularly in our home markets.
The combination of capabilities within Detica and BAE Systems will provide innovative solutions in this growing sector.
The opportunities presented by these circumstances do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within BAE Systems supporting the recognised goodwill.

BAE Systems Annual Report 2008 153 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 31.
Acquisition of subsidiaries continued Acquisition of subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2007 The Group made a number of acquisitions during the year ended 31 December 2007, the most significant of which was of Armor Holdings, Inc. in the US.
The acquisitions took place throughout the year ended 31 December 2007, but if they had occurred on 1 January 2007, combined sales of Group and equity accounted investments would have been 16.7bn, revenue 15.3bn and profit for the year ended 31 December 2007 from continuing operations 928m.
Armor Holdings, Inc. On 31 July 2007, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Armor Holdings, Inc. Armor, in the US, for a consideration of 1,696m, excluding transaction costs incurred by the acquiree 26m.
Goodwill arising on consolidation amounted to 1,554m.
Armor is a major manufacturer of tactical wheeled vehicles and a leading provider of vehicle and individual armour systems and survivability technologies for the military and for the law enforcement and commercial security markets.
1 In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2007, Armor contributed EBITA of 77m and profit after tax of 18m to the Groups consolidated results.
Mobile International, a subsidiary of Armor, was acquired with a view to immediate resale.
Accordingly, it was classified as held for sale in the acquisition balance sheet and as at 31 December 2007 note 19.
The acquisition of Armor complements the existing US business in the Land & Armaments business group creating synergy potential.
It allows for continued development of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected MRAP vehicles and Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles FMTV programmes, as well as advanced ceramics for body armour.
The opportunities presented by these circumstances do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within the Land & Armaments business group supporting the recognised goodwill.

Acquisition of subsidiaries continued Certain of the fair values assigned to the net assets at the date of acquisition were provisional, and in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the Group has adjusted the fair values attributable to legal provisions and associated deferred taxation in the year ended 31 December 2008, resulting in a net increase in goodwill on acquisition of 6m.
This has not had a material impact on the consolidated accounts and, as such, the Group has not restated the balance sheet at 31 December 2007.
Other acquisitions in 2007 Other acquisitions included the acquisition of Pitch Technologies AB and iSC for a consideration of 5m and 4m, respectively.
In each case, 100% of the shares were acquired.
As a result of these acquisitions, an additional 9m of goodwill was generated in the year.
Financial risk management A discussion of the Groups treasury objectives and policies and the use of financial instruments can be found in the Directors report.
Financial instruments comprise net cash debt note 29 together with other financial assets and other financial liabilities note 17 and other instruments deemed to be financial instruments under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, including non-current receivables, non-current payables and non-current provisions.

Financial risk management continued Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of a financial instrument is the price at which one party would assume the rights and or duties of another party.
The fair values of financial instruments have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair value of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: and the fair value of loans and overdrafts has been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market-based interest rates prevailing at 31 December.
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at the balance sheet date may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would expect to realise in a current market environment.
The following table compares the estimated fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities to their carrying values at the balance 1 sheet date.
Net carrying Estimated Net carrying Estimated amount fair value amount fair value 2008 2008 2007 2007 m m m m Assets Non-current 2 Other receivables 125 125 265 265 Other financial assets 514 514 48 48 Current Other investments 164 164 Other financial assets 674 674 101 101 Cash and cash equivalents 2,624 2,624 3,062 3,062 Liabilities Non-current Loans 2,608 3,090 2,197 2,399 Other financial liabilities 383 383 26 26 Current Loans and overdrafts 173 173 299 308 Other financial liabilities 362 362 71 71 1 The estimated fair values of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are consistent with their carrying values at the balance sheet date.
2 Net carrying amount approximates to estimated fair value as there is no active market.
Interest rate risk Based on contracted maturities and or repricing dates, the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over the future as shown below: Beyond 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2013 m m m m m m Assets Current Cash and cash equivalents 2,624 Liabilities Non-current Loans 651 651 279 110 80 Current Loans and overdrafts 50 156 www.
Financial risk management continued Collateral As shown above, the Group has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts to hedge certain long-term foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
Cash collateral payments can be required to be made periodically to the counterparty dependent on the market value of these financial derivatives.
Cash deposited in this way is treated as a non-current receivable and at 31 December 2008 totalled nil 2007 109m.
Committed undrawn borrowing facilities At 31 December 2008 the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 1.5bn, which expires in more than two years but less than five years 2007 1.5bn which expires in more than two years but less than five years.
Of the 1.5bn, 45m relates to Lehman Brothers Commercial Paper Inc.
The RCF was originally contracted for five years until 2010.
However, it has been extended by the agreement of two one-year extensions until 2012, although the available amount for the final year has been reduced from 1.5bn to 1.3bn.
The RCF remained undrawn throughout the year.
Interest rate fluctuations The objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings and deposits.
This is achieved through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon by utilising derivative instruments, mainly interest rate swaps.
The Groups current interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 25% 2007 25% and a maximum of 75% 2007 75% of debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had 73% 2007 75% of fixed rate debt and 27% 2007 25% of floating rate debt based on a gross debt of 2.6bn including debt-related derivative financial assets 2007 2.5bn.
The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars.
At the end of 2008, the Group had a total of $1.3bn 2007 $1.3bn of this type of swap outstanding with a weighted average duration of 2.4 years 2007 3.2 years.
In respect of the fixed rate debt the weighted average period in respect of which interest is fixed was seven years 2007 seven years.
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 5.2% 2007 6.7%, 3.5% on US dollars and 8% on sterling 2007 6.3% on US dollars and 7.3% on sterling.
The cost of the fixed rate debt was 6.8% 2007 7.1%.
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost to the Group by 6m 2007 7m.
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Groups working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term periods based at floating interest rates.
A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average cash deposits would vary the interest receivable by 12m 2007 23m.
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents The Group is exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents to the extent of non-performance by its counterparties in respect of financial instruments.
However, the Group has policies in place to ensure credit risk is limited by placing concentration limits.
BAE Systems has a credit limit system to manage actively its exposure to treasury counterparties.
The cash and cash equivalents balance at 31 December 2008 of 2,624m 2007 3,062m was invested with 14 2007 26 financial institutions.
The system assigns a maximum exposure based on the counterpartys size, a composite credit rating and Credit Default Swap price.
These limits are regularly monitored and updated.
The Group has material receivables due from the UK and US governments where credit risk is not considered to be an issue.
For the remaining trade receivables no one counterparty constitutes more than 2% of the balance 2007 3%.
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid such as short-term deposits.
The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to credit risk and managed its price risk through this process.
Currency risk In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures.
Further explanation is set out in the Risk management and principal risks section of the Directors report on page 61.

Events after the balance sheet date In connection with the joint venture company BVT Surface Fleet Limited BVT, which was established on 1 July 2008, VT Group plc VT holds a put option exercisable from 1 July 2009 to sell its 45% interest in BVT to the Group for a minimum of 380m subject to adjustments.
In addition, on completion of that put option, deferred consideration of 65m plus interest in respect of the sale to VT of the Groups 50% shareholding in Flagship Training Limited becomes payable subject to adjustment.
In January 2009, VT announced that it had decided to exercise this put option and that it expects to be in a position to exercise that option by 1 July 2009.
