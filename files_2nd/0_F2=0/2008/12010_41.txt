 continued Areas which management believes require the most critical accounting estimations are: Landfill costs The estimation of landfill reserves is of particular importance in assessing landfill costs, since the cost of a landfill site is depreciated over its estimated operational life taking into account the usage of void space and gas production at the site post closure.
The estimates of landfill reserves are regularly reviewed and updated during the financial year for usage and other events for example site extensions.
Estimates are also subject to physical review by external advisors.
A number of factors impact on the depreciation of landfill reserves including the available landfill space, future capital expenditure and operating costs.
The assumptions are revised as these factors change.
Carrying value of long-life assets The Groups accounting policy for property, plant and equipment assets is set out in note 2.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 March 2008 was 2,663.0 million.
In the year ended 31 March 2008 additions totalled 228.8 million and the depreciation charge was 129.2 million.
Estimated useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are based on managements judgement and experience.
When management identifies that actual useful lives differ materially from the estimates used to calculate depreciation, that charge is adjusted prospectively.
Due to the significance of capital investment to the Group, variations between actual and estimated useful lives could impact operating results both positively and negatively.
Historically, only minor changes to estimated useful lives have been required.
Revenue recognition The Group recognises revenue at the time of delivery of services.
Payments received in advance of services delivered are recorded as a liability.
South West Water Limited raises bills and recognises revenue in accordance with its entitlement to receive revenue in line with the limits established by the Periodic Review price setting process.
For water and waste water customers with water meters, revenue recognised is dependent upon the volume supplied including an estimate of the sales value of units supplied between the date of the last meter reading and the financial year end.
Estimated usage is based on historic data, judgement and assumptions: actual results could differ from these estimates which would result in operating revenue being adjusted in the period in which the revision of the estimates is determined.
Provision for doubtful debts At the balance sheet date each subsidiary evaluates the collectability of trade debtors and records provisions for doubtful debts based on experience including comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write-off history.
The actual level of debt collected may differ from the estimated levels of recovery and could impact future operating results positively or negatively.
Impairment of intangible assets The Group records all assets and liabilities acquired in business acquisitions, including goodwill, at fair value.
Intangible assets which have an indefinite useful life, principally goodwill, are assessed at least annually for impairment.
The initial goodwill recorded and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make estimations of future cash flows, terminal values and an assessment of the long-term pre-tax discount rate to be applied to those cash flows which reflects an assessment of the cost of capital of the cash-generating unit.
