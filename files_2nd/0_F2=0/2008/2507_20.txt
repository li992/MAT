Job: 10795 British Energy R&A 08 BCK AW Proof: 02 Proof Read by: Operator: Nigel Date: 02.06.2008 Server: studio 3 Set-up: Dave First Read Revisions FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2008 1.
Presentation of the Financial Statements i Description of Business British Energy Group plc is engaged in the generation and sale of electricity.
References to the Company are to British Energy Group plc, the ultimate holding company of the Group.
References to the Group are to the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Group operates eight nuclear power stations and one coalred power station in the United Kingdom.
British Energy Group plc is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in Great Britain.
British Energy Group plcs ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 28 May 2008. ii Compliance with Applicable Law and IFRS The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
iii Financial Period The consolidated financial statements cover the financial year from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008, with comparative gures for the financial year from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007. iv Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements consolidate the financial statements of British Energy Group plc and the entities it controls its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 March each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised pro ts arising from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated in full.
A list of subsidiary undertakings which, in the opinion of the Directors, principally affected the amount of pro t or the net assets of the Group is given in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
v Composition of the Consolidated Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements consolidate the financial statements of British Energy Group plc and all of its subsidiary undertakings, and comprise the following: consolidated income statement: consolidated statement of recognised income and expense: consolidated balance sheet: consolidated statement of cash ows: and notes to the consolidated financial statements.
vi Accounting Convention The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, modi ed for certain items carried at fair value, as stated in the accounting policies.
vii New Accounting Policy During the year the NLF converted part of its entitlement to receive Cash Sweep Payments see note 30.
In order to re ect this, the accounting policy 2 xiii was adopted which resulted in the recognition of a conversion asset of 2,340m, additional equity share capital of 45m and additional share premium of 2,295m representing the excess of the conversion share price of 5.20 over the nominal value of shares issued.
The application of this new accounting policy resulted in shareholders funds at 31 March 2008 being increased by 2,173m and the pro t for the year ended 31 March 2008 being reduced by 167m see note 15. viii Change in Accounting Estimate On 11 December 2007, British Energy Group plc extended the useful accounting lives of two of the Groups nuclear power stations by five years.
The change in accounting estimate has been accounted for prospectively and the effect from 11 December 2007 to 31 March 2008 was to decrease nuclear liability revalorisation by 125m, reduce NLF receivable revalorisation by 125m, reduce the conversion asset amortisation by 13m and reduce property, plant and equipment depreciation by 6m.
As a result of these accounting life extensions for the year ending 31 March 2009, the Group expects that: nuclear liability revalorisation will decrease by 7m and NLF receivable revalorisation will decrease by 7m therefore having no income statement impact: conversion asset amortisation will reduce by 41m: and property, plant and equipment depreciation will reduce by 27m.

Presentation of the Financial Statements continued ix Parent Company Financial Statements British Energy Group plc, the Company, has not adopted IFRS and has therefore drawn up separate financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP.
These are presented in the Annual Report on pages 97 to 102.
Accounting Policies i Signi cant Estimates and Judgements Used in Applying Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group in the consolidated financial statements are as set out below.
The application of a number of these policies required the Group to use a variety of estimation techniques and apply judgement to best re ect the substance of underlying transactions.
Signi cant factors considered when using estimates to assess the carrying value of assets include future electricity prices, expected annual output, expected station operating costs, remaining station lives and discount rates.
The Group has determined that a number of its accounting policies can be considered signi cant, in terms of the management judgement that has been required to determine the various assumptions underpinning their application in the consolidated financial statements presented which, under different conditions, could lead to material differences in these statements.
The policies where signi cant judgements have been made are the: application of business combination accounting rules: accounting for conversion asset: accounting for property, plant and equipment: accounting for goodwill: accounting for coal inventory: estimation of liabilities for spent nuclear fuel and decommissioning costs: estimation of retirement bene t obligations: estimation of fair value of derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts: and accounting for deferred tax.
Actual results can differ from estimates.
ii Revenue Revenue is recognised by the Group when a sales arrangement exists, delivery of goods or services has occurred, the amount of revenue and costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic bene ts will ow to the Group.
Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration receivable for sales of electricity supplied during the period and sales of other related goods and services.
It is shown net of value added tax, electricity purchases relating to short-term balancing and hedging activities, and climate change levy.
Revenue is also shown after elimination of sales within the Group.
Wholesale generation and direct supply sales are recognised on an accruals basis with reference to meter readings of electricity supplied.
Where required, a management estimate is included of the value of units supplied to customers between the date of their last meter reading and the accounting period end.
Where an estimate of electricity supplied is required, the estimate is calculated using historical consumption patterns and is included in trade receivables.
Revenue includes miscellaneous income that comprises mainly services to Magnox in respect of shared sites and the income generated from the Groups role in trading the electrical output of the Nuclear Decommissioning Agencys Magnox nuclear power stations.
iii Fuel Costs Nuclear Front End Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors AGR Front end fuel costs consist of the costs of procurement of uranium, conversion and enrichment services and fuel element fabrication.
Fabrication costs comprise xed and variable elements.
All costs are capitalised into inventory and charged to the consolidated income statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
Pressurised Water Reactor PWR All front end fuel costs are variable and are capitalised into inventory and subsequently charged to the consolidated income statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.

Accounting Policies continued iv Fuel Costs Nuclear Back End AGR Spent fuel extracted from the reactors is sent for reprocessing and or long-term storage and eventual disposal of resulting waste products.
Back end fuel costs comprise: a a cost per tonne of uranium in AGR fuel, in respect of amounts payable on loading of fuel into any one of the AGR reactors: and b a rebate surcharge against the cost mentioned in a above that is dependent on the out-turn market electricity price in the year and the amount of electricity generated in the year.
The loading related cost and the rebate surcharge is capitalised into inventory and charged to the consolidated income statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
PWR Back end fuel costs are based on wet storage in station ponds followed by dry storage and subsequent direct disposal of fuel.
Back end fuel costs comprise the estimated cost of this process at current prices discounted back to current value.
Back end fuel costs are capitalised into inventory on loading and charged to the consolidated income statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
v Unburnt Fuel at Shutdown Due to the nature of the nuclear fuel process there will be some unburnt fuel in the reactors at station closure.
The costs of this unburnt fuel final core are fully provided at the balance sheet date and any changes in the carrying value of nuclear fuel attributed to the final core are charged to the consolidated income statement in the accounting period.
vi Fuel Costs Eggborough Fuel costs for Eggborough are determined on a weighted average cost basis.
Fuel costs for Eggborough also include costs of carbon allowances see note 2 xv.
vii Research Expenditure Expenditure on scienti c and engineering research, preliminary studies and the initiation of new technologies is categorised as research and charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred.
viii Operating Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and bene ts of ownership of the asset are classi ed as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
ix Foreign Currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the balance sheet.
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
x Share-based Payment The Group has five share compensation schemes, the Share Incentive Plan, the Deferred Incentive Plan, the Long-Term Deferred Bonus Plan, the Executive Share Option Plan 2004 and the Interim Bonus Plan.
The Group accounts for its share compensation schemes in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment IFRS 2.
The fair value of the share compensation schemes is charged to the consolidated income statement over the period from the date the awards were granted to the date at which the compensation is expected to vest on the employees.
The corresponding credit is included in total shareholders equity.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the Groups various employee share compensation schemes.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.
xi Exceptional Items Exceptional items, by their nature, are not indicative of the underlying operating performance of the Group.
Exceptional items are material to the results for the year and are of a non-recurring nature and are therefore presented separately.

Accounting Policies continued xii Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences identi ed at the balance sheet date using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro ts.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that taxable pro t will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged to the consolidated income statement except where it relates to items charged or credited to equity in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in equity.
xiii Conversion Asset The conversion asset represents the asset which arose following partial exercise of the NLFs conversion right see note 2 xviii.
The partial NLF conversion has been accounted for under IFRS 2.
The issue of new shares by British Energy Group plc gave rise to the recording of ordinary share capital, together with a share premium representing the excess of the conversion share price over the nominal value of shares issued.
The partial conversion also gave rise to a conversion asset which represents the fair value of the obligation which is removed as a result of the partial exercise of the conversion right.
The conversion asset is allocated between current and non-current assets as appropriate on the consolidated balance sheet.
The fair value of the conversion asset recorded as a result of the partial exercise of the conversion right has been deemed to be the fair value of the new equity issued at the conversion date.
Following initial recognition, the conversion asset is measured at cost less amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The charge for amortisation is calculated so as to write the conversion asset off on a straight line basis over the estimated useful accounting lives of the nuclear power stations.
xiv Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment comprises assets acquired or constructed by the Group.
Property, plant and equipment other than assets in the course of construction are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired as a result of the Restructuring was deemed to be the cost amount recognised at that date.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Accumulated depreciation includes additional charges made where necessary to re ect impairment in value.
Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost and not depreciated until commissioned.
The charge for depreciation of property, plant and equipment is based on the straight line method so as to write off the costs of assets, after taking into account provisions for diminution in value, over their estimated useful lives.
The asset lives adopted are reviewed annually and for the year ended 31 March 2008 were: AGR power stations 6 15 years PWR power station 27 years Eggborough power station 8 years Other buildings 30 years Other plant and equipment 18 months 5 years Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately, or to improve its operational performance is included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate when it is probable that future economic bene ts in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset will ow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Expenditure to improve safety or in order to meet increased regulatory standards is also capitalised.
Expenditure on major inspection and overhauls of production plant is capitalised, within other plant and equipment, when it meets the asset recognition criteria and is depreciated over the period until the next Outage.
For AGR power stations, this depreciation period is two to three years, for the PWR power station it is 18 months and for Eggborough it is four years.
Major spare parts are classi ed as property, plant and equipment and assigned to individual stations when they are expected to be utilised over more than one period.
They are depreciated using the applicable station lifetime estimate.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are included in operating pro t. 58 British Energy Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 08 M M6005 BE back.

Accounting Policies continued xv Intangible Assets excluding Goodwill The costs of acquired computer software are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring the speci c software in to use, and are amortised using the straight line method over their estimated operational lives for a maximum of five years.
Costs directly associated with the development of computer software programmes that are expected to generate economic bene ts over a period in excess of one year are also capitalised and amortised over their estimated operational lives.
Purchased Renewable Obligation Certi cates ROCs and Levy Exemption Certi cates LECs are initially recognised at cost within intangible assets.
A liability for ROCs is recognised based on the level of electricity supplied to customers, and is calculated in accordance with percentages set by the UK Government and the renewable obligation certi cate buyout price for that period.
ROCs and LECs have sustainable values and can be used over an unrestricted period and therefore they are not amortised.
Under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme EU ETS, granted carbon allowances received in a period are initially recognised at nil value within intangible assets.
Purchased carbon allowances are initially recognised at cost within intangible assets.
Allowances granted are apportioned over the year in line with actual and forecast emissions for the relevant emissions year.
A liability is recognised when actual emissions are greater than the granted allowances apportioned for the year.
The liability is measured at the cost of purchased allowances up to the level of purchased allowances held, and then at the market price of allowances ruling at the balance sheet date, with movements in the liability recognised in operating pro t. Forward contracts for the purchase or sale of carbon allowances are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement in the unrealised net gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts line.
On delivery of forward contracts, carbon allowances are capitalised in intangible assets at cost, with any permanent reduction to bring the carrying value in line with market prices being presented within fuel costs.
Carbon allowances have a sustainable value and can be used in settlement of the Groups EU ETS obligation at any time within the corresponding EU ETS Phase.
As a result, carbon allowances are not amortised.
xvi Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets excluding Goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews its tangible assets and intangible assets excluding goodwill see note 2 xvii to determine whether there is any indication that those assets may have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is assessed.
If an asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce the assets carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount.
xvii Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration at acquisition compared to the fair value of the identi able net assets acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset on the consolidated balance sheet.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill balances are assessed for impairment at least annually and at other balance sheet dates if there is any indication of impairment.
xviii NLF Funding Arrangements Under the arrangements with the Secretary of State the NLF will fund, subject to certain exceptions, the Groups qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities and qualifying decommissioning costs.
To the extent there is any surplus remaining in the NLF after all obligations have been discharged, this amount will be paid to the Secretary of State.
The Group is responsible for funding certain excluded or disquali ed liabilities and will, in certain circumstances, be required to compensate or indemnify the NLF and the Secretary of State in relation to such liabilities.
The Groups obligations under these arrangements with the Secretary of State are guaranteed by certain companies within the Group.
In consideration for the assumption of these liabilities by the Secretary of State and the NLF, British Energy Bond Finance plc formerly British Energy Holdings plc a subsidiary of British Energy Group plc issued 275m in Bonds to the NLF at RED.
The Group will also make the following payments to the NLF: i an annual contribution Cash Sweep Payment initially equal to 65%, reduced to 36% following the partial conversion, of the Groups adjusted net cash ow, adjusted for certain corporate actions but never to exceed 65% Cash Sweep percentage : ii xed decommissioning contributions equal to 20m per annum indexed to RPI but tapering off as the nuclear power stations were scheduled to close at RED : and iii 150,000 indexed to RPI for every tonne of uranium in PWR fuel loaded into the Sizewell B reactor after RED.
The NLF has the right from time to time to convert all or part of the Cash Sweep Payment into convertible shares of British Energy Group plc the NLF conversion right.
On a full conversion of its remaining interest, the NLF would hold up to approximately 35% of the thereby enlarged equity share capital of British Energy Group plc.
However, the terms of the convertible shares include a limit on the voting rights of such shares equal to a maximum of 29.9% whilst held by the NLF.
See note 30 for more details on the convertible shares.
The annual Cash Sweep Payment accrual can only be determined after the end of the financial year and is contingent based on cash generation in the year.
Therefore, it is only recognised and provided for when it becomes determinable and not in any interim financial periods.
It will be recorded as an operating cost of the applicable financial year.
The annual Cash Sweep Payment accrual becomes payable 25 business days after publication of the Annual Report and Accounts.

Accounting Policies continued The xed decommissioning obligations of 20m per annum have been recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet at their discounted value and disclosed as the NLF liability.
The NLF liability is reduced as payments are made to the NLF.
Each year the nancing charges in the consolidated income statement include the revalorisation of NLF liabilities required to discharge one years discount from the liability.
PWR fuel loaded after RED will increase the qualifying nuclear liability recognised for back end PWR fuel costs as set out above and will increase the NLF receivable by a corresponding amount.
The difference between the payment of 150,000 indexed to RPI per tonne made to the NLF on the loading of PWR fuel and the increase in the liability recognised upon loading of this fuel is matched against back end fuel costs as the loaded tonnes are burned in the PWR reactor.
xix NLF and Nuclear Liabilities Receivables The Government indemnity is provided to indemnify any future shortfall on NLF funding of qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities including PWR back end fuel services and qualifying nuclear decommissioning costs.
The NLF receivable asset recognised represents the aggregate value of the Nuclear Liabilities Fund and the Government indemnity such that the receivable equals the present value of the associated qualifying nuclear liabilities.
The Government indemnity is also provided to cover the cost of services for spent AGR fuel loaded pre-Restructuring.
The nuclear liabilities receivable is recognised in respect of the indemnity such that the receivable equals the present value of the associated qualifying nuclear liabilities.
The NLF receivable and the nuclear liabilities receivable are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at current price levels, discounted at a long-term real rate of interest of 3% per annum to take account of the timing of payments.
Each year the nancing charges in the consolidated income statement include the revalorisation of these receivables required to match the revalorisation of the nuclear liabilities.
xx Nuclear Liabilities Nuclear liabilities represent provision for the Groups liabilities in respect of the costs of waste management of spent fuel and nuclear decommissioning.
The provisions represent the Directors best estimates of the costs expected to be incurred.
They are calculated based on the latest technical evaluation of the processes and methods likely to be used, and re ect current engineering knowledge.
The provisions are based on such commercial agreements as are currently in place, and re ect the Directors understanding of the current Government policy and regulatory framework.
Given that Government policy and the regulatory framework on which the Groups assumptions have been based may be expected to develop and that the Directors plans will be in uenced by improvements in technology and experience gained from decommissioning activities, liabilities and the resulting provisions are likely to be adjusted.
In recognising the costs of generating electricity, accruals are made in respect of the following: a Back End Fuel Costs The treatment of back end fuel costs in the consolidated income statement has been dealt with under the accounting policies for fuel costs above.
These nuclear liabilities cover the reprocessing and storage of spent nuclear fuel and the long-term storage, treatment and eventual disposal of nuclear waste.
They are based, as appropriate, on contractual arrangements or the latest technical assessments of the processes and methods likely to be used to deal with these obligations under the current regulatory regime.
Accruals are included within nuclear liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, which are based on contractual arrangements and long-term cost forecasts, and which are reviewed regularly and adjusted where necessary.
b Decommissioning of Nuclear Power Stations The consolidated financial statements include provision for the full cost of decommissioning the Groups nuclear power stations.
Provision is made on the basis of the latest technical assessments of the processes and methods likely to be used for decommissioning under the current regulatory regime.
The liabilities for back end fuel costs and decommissioning are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at current price levels, discounted at a long-term real rate of interest of 3% per annum to take account of the timing of payments.
Each year the nancing charges in the consolidated income statement include the revalorisation of liabilities required to discharge one years discount from provisions made in prior years and restate these provisions to current price levels.

Accounting Policies continued xxi Financial Instruments Recognition, Classi cation and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39 requires that all financial assets and liabilities be initially recognised at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value reported through the consolidated income statement, or the hedge reserve to the extent that effective cash ow hedges exist.
Exceptions apply to assets classi ed as loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments, which are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, and also to equity investments in instruments whose fair value can not be reliably measured, which are recognised and measured at cost.
Financial liabilities are measured at fair value or at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The Group measures all debt instruments initially at fair value, and this is taken to be the fair value of the consideration received.
Where financial assets or financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, transaction costs any such costs incremental to and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instruments are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the consolidated income statement over the life of the instrument.
Where financial assets or financial liabilities are measured at fair value, transaction costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
If there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of an invoice, an impairment loss on the respective trade receivable will be recognised.
In such an instance, the carrying value of the receivable is reduced, with the amount of the loss recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Impaired trade receivables are derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to the cash ow from the asset expires.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation speci ed in the contract is extinguished or expires.
Accounting for Derivatives and Commodity Contracts The Groups activities expose it primarily to risks associated with electricity generation, the purchase of fuel for use in the generation process, the purchase of carbon allowances and the supply of electricity to end customers in both the wholesale and retail markets.
The Group follows a trading strategy of selling forward a proportion of the Groups output to reduce the Groups exposure to potential falls in the market price of electricity.
The use of derivative financial instruments occurs primarily within the Groups electricity trading and coal and carbon allowance procurement activities.
The Board has endorsed the use of derivative financial instruments as hedging tools and the Group uses derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage its exposures.
Physical and nancially settled instruments are held by the Group to match offsetting physical positions and are not held for proprietary trading purposes.
Where commodity contracts, such as electricity and fuel, are entered into in accordance with the Groups own purchase, sale or usage requirements own use they are excluded from the scope of IAS 39 and are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of these contracts are recorded within trade payables and trade receivables respectively.
Where a commodity contract is not entered in to or does not continue to be held to meet the Groups own purchase, sale or usage requirements it is treated as a derivative financial instrument, and the recognition and measurement requirements of IAS 39 are applied.
Derivative financial instruments are presented in the derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts line of the consolidated balance sheet.
Derivative financial instruments that are held for trading, as fide ned by IAS 39, are initially recognised at fair value and all changes in fair value are subsequently accounted for through the unrealised net gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts line of the consolidated income statement.
Held for trading assets and liabilities are classi ed as current in the consolidated balance sheet.
Derivative financial instruments that are designated and are effective as hedges of future cash ows are initially recognised at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised directly in equity, in the cash ow hedge reserve.
The ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Hedging instruments are classi ed as current or noncurrent with reference to the period of delivery.
The Group designates derivatives as cash ow hedging instruments when it is expected that there will be a high inverse correlation between the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument and the changes in the fair value of the cash ows of the hedged item.
This is measured primarily using the dollar offset method.
Such correlation is required to be within the limits of 80% to 125% for hedge accounting to be permitted.
Prospective and retrospective testing is carried out on a regular basis, at least on each reporting date, to establish whether the assumptions and application criteria for hedge accounting are supported.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting where the hedging relationship correlation is outside the required parameters.

Accounting Policies continued Derivative instruments are fide-designated from a hedge relationship when: the hedging instrument or item expires or is settled: the forecast transaction is no longer considered to be highly probable: and the hedging instrument no longer quali es for hedge accounting under IAS 39 rules.
Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity, in the cash ow hedge reserve, until the forecast transaction is settled.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised within equity is transferred to the consolidated income statement of the period.
Valuation of Commodity Contracts and Derivatives The Groups valuation policy for derivative and other financial instruments is to maximise the use of quoted prices from active trading markets.
All contracts that fall within the scope of IAS 39 are valued using observable market prices.
Certain long-term structured transactions have been classi ed as own use and therefore fall outside the scope of IAS 39.
The Group considers that the UK electricity market is active for up to two years ahead, with reliable broker quotes and published prices available for this period.
Purchase contracts are valued against the quoted bid price and sales contracts are valued against the quoted offer prices, with no provisions made for liquidity.
Valuation adjustments are made for the time value of money, which is applied to all contracts, and credit risk, which will be applied where applicable.
Principal values are undiscounted and are derived from the aggregate volumes and relevant contract prices of those sale and purchase contracts that are within the scope of IAS 39.
The principal values provide an indication of the scope of the use of derivatives but do not re ect the risk the Group is exposed to from entering into derivatives.
Embedded Derivatives The Group also evaluates contracts for embedded derivatives, and considers whether any embedded derivatives have to be separated from the underlying host contract and accounted for separately in accordance with IAS 39 requirements.
Where embedded derivatives have terms that are not closely related to the terms of the host contract in which they are included, they are accounted for separately from the host contract as derivatives, with changes in the fair value recorded in the consolidated income statement on the unrealised net gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts line, to the extent that the hybrid instrument is not already accounted for at fair value.
If the fair value can not be determined reliably based on the terms and conditions of the embedded derivatives, the fair value of the embedded derivatives is calculated as the difference between the value of the hybrid instrument and the host contract excluding the derivative element.
Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Liabilities The Group offsets a financial asset and a financial liability and reports the net amount only when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Impact on Effective Tax Rate Income tax for interim reporting periods is calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate to the interim result excluding IAS 39 adjustments, and by calculating tax at the standard rate for the IAS 39 adjustments arising within the period.

Accounting Policies continued xxv Employee Bene ts Post Retirement Bene t Obligations The Group provides for pension costs in accordance with IAS 19 2004 Employee Bene ts IAS 19.
Contributions to the Groups fide ned bene t pension schemes are assessed by quali ed actuaries.
The Group operates two separate pension arrangements in the UK within the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, which is a fide ned bene t scheme.
Pension scheme assets are measured using market values, which for securities is based on bid price values.
Pension costs are assessed using the projected unit method so that the cost of providing pensions is charged to the consolidated income statement in a manner which spreads the service cost over the expected service lives of employees.
The retirement bene t obligation is measured as the present value of the estimated future cash out ows, discounted using the yields on high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity.
The expected return on the plan assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the fide ned bene t obligations arising from the passage of time are included in other finance expenses.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately within the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
The capital cost of ex-gratia and supplementary pensions is charged to the consolidated income statement, to the extent that the arrangements can not be covered by any surplus in schemes, in the accounting period in which they are granted.
Certain additional unfunded retirement bene ts are provided to eligible employees.
The cost and actuarial gains and losses of providing such bene ts is charged to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of recognised income and expense respectively.

Cash Sweep Payment Credit As part of the Contribution Agreement made at the time of Restructuring, the Group has an obligation to make annual Cash Sweep Payments to the Nuclear Liabilities Fund should certain criteria be met.
Under the terms of the original Contribution Agreement, on a conversion by the NLF of part or all of its Cash Sweep Payment right, the NLF was entitled to both a Cash Sweep Payment on the part converted for the period up to conversion and any dividend in respect of the same period on the shares arising from the conversion.
The Group obtained agreement from the NLF and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry now the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to an amendment to the Cash Sweep Payment right and Cash Sweep Payment percentage adjustment formula in relation to the partial conversion, which took place in the year, so as to ensure the principle of economic parity was maintained and to avoid an unintended dilution of British Energy Group plcs equity shareholders interests.
As a result, the 305m accrued in the 2007 Annual Report and Accounts for the Cash Sweep Payment due for the year ended 31 March 2007 was reduced by 134m to 171m to re ect the NLFs agreement to waive the proportion of the 2007 obligation due that was extinguished by the partial conversion in June 2007.
The 134m reduction has been recognised as a credit in the consolidated income statement for this year: the remaining 171m obligation was paid in July 2007.
Cash Sweep Payment Accrual Under the terms of the Restructuring, the Group has an obligation to make payments to the NLF should certain criteria be met.
The basis of the Cash Sweep Payment accrual, which remains subject to review by the NLF, is as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2008 2007 m m Decrease increase in cash as per the consolidated statement of cash flows 73 463 Increase decrease in restricted cash 178 111 Increase in restricted cash excluded from Cash Sweep Payment accrual 1 1 Increase decrease in restricted cash for Agreed Collateral Purposes 177 112 Other 1 Increase in available cash 105 351 Cash Sweep Payments to the NLF 171 105 Administration payment to the NLF 1 Transfer to from Forecast Expenditure Reserve 55 22 Equity dividends paid 140 Amounts received from issue or sale of ordinary shares 7 6 Cash required to be retained released to meet Target Amount 67 1 Adjusted net cash flow 288 473 Weighted average payment percentage 35.4% 64.4% Cash Sweep Payment accrual 102 305 66 British Energy Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 08 M M6005 BE back.

Cash Sweep Payment Accrual continued An accrual for the Cash Sweep Payment of 102m 2007: 305m is included in trade and other payables within current liabilities see note 24.
In July 2007 a reduced Cash Sweep Payment of 171m for the year ended 31 March 2007 was paid see note 8.
Target Amount and Cash Required to be Retained to Meet Target Amount The Target Amount is 490m plus the Incremental Collateral Amount, which is the amount by which cash applied to providing collateral for the generation, sale and purchase by the Group of electricity i. e. for Agreed Collateral Purposes exceeds 200m.
Any increase or decrease in the Incremental Collateral Amount shall automatically increase or decrease the Target Amount by the same amount.
The restricted cash for Agreed Collateral Purposes at 31 March 2008 is 267m 2007: 90m, therefore the Target Amount and cash required to be retained to meet the Target Amount at the balance sheet dates are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2008 2007 m m Cash required to be retained to meet Target Amount in prior years 490 491 Base Target Amount 490 490 Incremental collateral in excess of 200m see above 67 Target Amount at 31 March 557 490 Cash required to be retained released to meet Target Amount 67 1 Payments to NLF Payments to NLF represent the aggregate of any payments made by or on behalf of the Group to the NLF during the year, excluding xed decommissioning payments of 20m per annum indexed to RPI but tapering off as the nuclear power stations were scheduled to close at RED and 150,000 indexed to RPI for every tonne of uranium in PWR fuel loaded into Sizewell B reactor after RED.
Forecast Expenditure Reserve The Group has increased the Forecast Expenditure Reserve by 55m 2007: 22m reduction to 210m 2007: 155m.
The Forecast Expenditure Reserve will be used to meet capital expenditure commitments and non-recurring maintenance and repair of a capital nature which is payable in the following financial year, as well as to fund capital expenditure, as fide ned in the underlying agreements.
Weighted Average Payment Percentage The weighted average payment percentage has decreased from 64.4% at 31 March 2007 to 35.4% at 31 March 2008 principally as a result of the NLFs partial conversion into equity of its Cash Sweep Payment right in June 2007.
The remainder of the decrease relates to the exercise of 6,955,809 British Energy Group plcs Warrants and the Cash Sweep Payment, offset by the impact of the dividend payment made during the year.
At 31 March 2008 there were 6,764,057 unexercised Warrants remaining.
Payment Percentage The NLF Cash Sweep percentage is 35.1% at 31 March 2008 2007: 64.0%.

Diluted Earnings Per Share The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the weighted average of 946,439,433 2007: 570,769,647 ordinary shares in issue together with the dilutive weighted average of potential ordinary shares of 5,519,514 2007: 11,378,881 in respect of Warrants.
Adjusted Earnings Per Share The Directors consider that the adjusted earnings per share calculation is a more appropriate earnings measure because the Cash Sweep Payment accrual of 102m 2007: 305m and the net pro t for the year attributable to shareholders of 335m 2007: 465m does not necessarily re ect the respective economic interests of the NLF and equity shareholders in the pro ts of the Group.
The calculation in any given year of the annual Cash Sweep Payment accrual is based on cash ows and the retention of appropriate cash Target Amount and expenditure Forecast Expenditure Reserve reserves see note 9.
The adjusted earnings per share has been calculated by excluding the following from the net pro t for the year attributable to shareholders: the Cash Sweep Payment credit relating to the year ended 31 March 2007: the Cash Sweep Payment accrual for the year: and the amortisation of the conversion asset for the year.
The weighted average share capital is adjusted by the number of shares that would have been in issue if: the NLF had fully converted their remaining interest at the balance sheet date: and the partial conversion had taken place at the start of the year, rather than during the year.

As a result on 6 June 2007 British Energy Group plc issued 450 million convertible shares of 10p each to the NLF, which were re-designated as 450 million ordinary shares of 10p each and admitted to the Of cial List of the UKLA and to trading on the London Stock Exchange on the same day.
Following the partial conversion and share issue the Cash Sweep Payment percentage was reduced to approximately 36% and resulted in the recognition of a conversion asset of 2,340m, additional equity share capital of 45m and additional share premium of 2,295m representing the excess of the conversion share price of 5.20 over the nominal value of shares issued.
The conversion asset represents the fair value of the obligation which was removed as a result of the exercise of the conversion right.
The conversion asset is amortised over the estimated useful accounting lives of the Groups nuclear power stations.
The amortisation of the conversion asset is recognised in the amortisation of conversion asset line in the consolidated income statement.

Under the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3, during the year ended 31 March 2006 23m was charged to the consolidated income statement to reduce goodwill in relation to recognition of a deferred tax asset at 31 March 2006, which at RED did not satisfy the recognition criteria within IFRS 3 due to uncertainty of recoverability.
Additionally during that year 23m was credited within the tax charge in the consolidated income statement to re ect the recognition of the deferred tax asset.
For impairment testing purposes goodwill has been fully allocated to one cash generating unit being the total of the Groups operating and generating assets.
There were no intangible assets with inde nite useful lives allocated to the cash generating unit.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit at 31 March 2008 was determined using estimated fair value less costs to sell.
The calculation of fair value less costs to sell was based on a discounted cash ow valuation over the lives of the power stations, using available market information to re ect the amount that the Group estimates that it could have obtained, at the balance sheet date, from the disposal of the asset in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal.
The calculation of fair value less costs to sell for the cash generating unit is most sensitive to the following key assumptions: electricity prices: projected output: fuel costs: other operating costs and investment: Cash Sweep Payment obligation: and value attributable to potential nuclear new build development.
The Groups approach in determining the key assumptions was as follows: Electricity prices were based on contracted and projected commodity prices for electricity.
Projected market prices for electricity were based on an external market view of projected long-term electricity prices.
Projected output was based on expected levels of output over the expected operating lives of the power stations using the Groups own engineering projections which considered historical performance, plant degradation, plant maintenance activity and investment, and allow for scheduled timings of outages and refuelling.
Where possible these assumptions were validated externally.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets continued Fuel costs were based on contracted and projected commodity prices, for coal and nuclear fuel, and using the Groups own engineering projections for consumption having considered historical consumption data and projected plant performance.
Other operating costs and investment was estimated using the Groups own engineering projections, where relevant, and having considered historical performance, plant degradation, plant maintenance activity and investment.
The estimates of other operating costs and investment used in the discounted cash ow projection were consistent with those used in the Groups three year business plan.
In subsequent periods the growth rate applied to other operating costs was based on the RPI and fully re ects the expected operating lives of the power stations.
The impairment calculations made allowance for projected levels of Cash Sweep Payment.
The projection used the Cash Sweep percentage as at 31 March 2008 as a starting point, with adjustments in subsequent years to allow for retentions of undistributed cash following payment of dividends in line with the Groups dividend policy as set out on pages 25 and 26 in the Financial Review.
A pre-tax discount rate of 17% 2007: 23% was used equivalent to a post-tax discount rate of 9% 2007: 9%.
The Groups value attributable to potential nuclear new build development has been assessed by the Directors.
With regard to the assessment of value of the cash generating unit, the Group is of the opinion that, based on current knowledge, reasonably possible changes in any of the above key assumptions would not cause the carrying value to exceed the recoverable amount.
Software Software is amortised over its estimated operational life for a maximum of five years.
The amortisation of software is recognised in the other amortisation line of the consolidated income statement.
ROCs and LECs ROCs and LECs have a sustainable value and can be used in settlement of an obligation over an unde ned period and therefore, on this basis, ROCs and LECs are not amortised.
Included within additions of 69m in the year 2007: 40m are ROCs and LECs with a value of 9m 2007: 8m which were produced internally.
Carbon Allowances Carbon allowances are not amortised because they are held to settle the Groups EU ETS obligation and therefore have a sustainable value.
During the year the Group took delivery of Phase I carbon allowances, which had been purchased under forward contracts.
In line with the Groups accounting policy, these carbon allowances were recognised within intangible assets at cost.
Subsequently, a write down of 58m 2007: 41m was charged to the consolidated income statement to re ect a reduction in market prices of Phase I carbon allowances.
During the year these allowances were used to settle the Groups 2007 EU ETS obligation, therefore the write down has had no impact on the carrying value of carbon allowances at 31 March 2008.

Restricted Cash and Other Financial Assets and Cash and Cash Equivalents continued Other financial assets principally comprise net cash provided to satisfy variation margin calls in relation to trading through exchanges.
These funds are non-interest bearing and availability of the cash pledged is restricted pending settlement of the related forward instrument.
Cash not immediately required for business purposes is invested in line with the Groups treasury policy.
At 31 March 2008 all cash investments not used to support collateral arrangements were due to mature within three months.
The investments made during the year ended 31 March 2008 have a weighted average interest rate of 5.84% 2007: 4.92%.
As at 31 March 2008 and 2007, all cash and cash equivalent deposits are with counterparties with investment grades of at least AAA for money market funds, or a short-term rating of A1, P1 or F1 for all other deposits, as per the Groups treasury management policy.
For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash ows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank of 1,028m 2007: 1,101m.
Financial Instruments and Derivatives Overview The Groups principal financial instruments include derivative commodity contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity, purchase of coal and carbon allowances, interest bearing debt, loans, investments in short-dated commercial paper, cash held in collateral accounts, cash and short-term deposits.
The main financial risks faced by the Group are trading risks in respect of the sale of electricity.
Electricity trading risks include exposure to electricity price uctuations, balancing of output volume with contractual commitments, commodity coal, carbon allowances and uranics price risk and counterparty credit risk.
These are managed by the Groups Trading and Sales division which operates within policies and procedures that are approved and monitored by the Board.
The Trading and Sales division is not permitted to take speculative open positions.
Non-trading financial risks, including liquidity, interest rate and foreign exchange risks are managed by the Groups central treasury department which also operates within policies and procedures that are approved and monitored by the Board.
The treasury department is not permitted to take speculative open positions.
The foregoing discussion and the Financial Risk Management section of the Financial Review summarises how the Group manages its exposures to risks in respect of electricity prices, output balancing, commodity prices, counterparty credit risk, liquidity, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Full details of the Groups risks and the strategy for managing those exposures are set out in the Financial Review on pages 14 to 27.
The Group also has an exposure to risks associated with uctuations in the debt and equity markets through the pension schemes: further details of the pension schemes are provided in note 27.

Of the derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts resting with a counterparty, 81% 2007: 95% are of an investment grade quality of at least A rated.
The decrease in the percentage from the prior year is due to the increase in the volume of open contracts for the purchase of green energy, the majority of which rest with unrated counterparties.

Details of the categories of financial assets and liabilities are set out below.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Commodity Contracts All contracts for the sale of electricity through British Energy Direct, most long-term structured sales contracts and all coal procurement contracts are categorised as being held for the Groups own purchase, sale or usage requirements and are therefore accounted for on an accruals basis because they are outside the scope of IAS 39.
GTMA and ISDA contracts are within the scope of IAS 39 as the Group follows the industry practice of net settling these contracts.
As a result, all changes in fair value impact the consolidated income statement for those contracts which do not qualify for cash ow hedge accounting.
The movements in fair value in the year are presented within unrealised net losses on derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts in the consolidated income statement.
Cash ow hedge accounting has been utilised wherever possible to ensure that earnings continue to be recognised in line with the Groups operational strategies by re ecting the earnings effects of derivative instruments in the same period as the hedged item affects earnings.
The variability of cash ows arising from a highly probable forecast sale of electricity under an existing variable priced own use sales contract has been designated as a hedged item for cash ow hedge accounting purposes.
Fair value changes of those GTMA and ISDA contracts which meet the requirements for cash ow hedge accounting are deferred in equity, within the hedge reserve, until settlement of the hedging instrument or hedged item.
Options contracts are recognised at fair value, with movements in fair value being presented within unrealised net losses on derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts in the consolidated income statement.
Exposures have been expressed as net positions by counterparty wherever there is the intention and ability to legally set off assets and liabilities.
i Held for Trading The Group classi es as held for trading short-term contracts, contracts which are not designated as cash ow hedges and contracts which have been fide-designated from hedging relationships.
Typically the term of these contracts does not exceed 12 months with prices xed at inception.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts asset and liability positions are valued, where possible, using quoted market prices.
More details on the method for determining fair value is set out in note 2 xxi.
The fair value of held for trading instruments equals the book value at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007.

Financial Instruments and Derivatives continued At 31 March 2008 the Group had held for trading assets of 53m 2007: 82m and liabilities of 43m 2007: 69m.
The movement in the fair value in the year is presented within unrealised net losses on derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts in the consolidated income statement and totals a loss of 3m 2007: 2m before tax.
The principal value of held for trading derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts at 31 March 2008 was 969m 2007: 903m.
The 969m falls due within one year whilst at 31 March 2007 of the 903m, 856m fell due within one year and 47m fell due after more than one year but not more than three years.
Included within the principal value of 969m 2007: 903m is 792m 2007: 531m relating to contracts where there will be a contractual out ow of cash from purchase contracts, all falling due within one year.
As at 31 March 2007 of the 531m, 495m fell due within one year and 36m fell due after more than one year but not more than three years.
ii Hedging Relationships As at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007, cash ow hedges were in place up to 31 March 2009 with the uncertain cash ow values on certain variable priced sales contracts being hedged by xed price GTMA and ISDA transactions.
The fair value of hedging instruments equals the book value at 31 March 2008 and at 31 March 2007.
At 31 March 2008 the Group had cash ow hedging instrument liabilities of 99m 2007: 20m and no cash ow hedging instrument assets 2007: 23m.
The movement in hedging relationships in the year was 102m 2007: 46m and is presented as a debit 2007: credit to the hedge reserve within equity.
There are no forecast transactions previously thought to be available for hedge accounting that are no longer expected to occur.
The principal value of derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts which are hedging relationships at 31 March 2008 was 91m 2007: 259m.
The 91m falls due within one year whilst at 31 March 2007 of the 259m, 150m fell due within one year and 109m fell due after more than one year but not more than three years.
Other Financial Assets and Liabilities The book value of the NLF and nuclear liabilities receivables is equal to the fair value, refer to note 17 for details of the valuation.
The carrying values of trade receivables, trade payables and accruals are equal to their fair values.
The fair values of restricted cash and other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents are equal to the book values due to short-term maturities.
Details of the interest rate pro le of these financial assets are included in note 21.
Borrowings consist of the Groups Bonds and the fair value has been estimated using the quoted closing clean market price at the balance sheet date.
Details of the interest rate and maturity pro le of these financial liabilities are included in note 23.
The basis of valuation of back end fuel costs is included in note 25.
The book value of provisions and other charges is equal to the fair value.
The book value of the NLF liabilities is equal to the fair value, refer to note 28 for details of the valuation.
Foreign Exchange The Group uses foreign exchange contracts and other derivative instruments as deemed necessary to economically hedge the primary market exposures associated with the Groups underlying assets, liabilities and committed transactions.
During the year ended 31 March 2008 the Group had three main sources of exposure to potential foreign currency risk.
These exposures related to contracts for the purchase of coal and uranics, which are predominantly in US dollars, and the purchase of carbon allowances, which are in Euros.
The Group has a number of different contracts in place to purchase coal, some of which include pricing which is subject to dollar exchange rate movements.
Refer to note 36 for details of the Groups commitments to purchase coal.
The Group incurs pass through foreign currency costs relating to the supply, conversion and enrichment of uranium at the average exchange rate relevant to the fuel supplied.
As at 31 March 2008, the Group had foreign currency commitments for nuclear fuel amounting to 70m 2007: 131m out of a total fuel commitment of 1,440m 2007: 1,568m see note 36.
During the year the Group has been involved in the purchase of 58m 2007: 44m of Phase I carbon allowances at the Euro foreign exchange rate ruling at the time of the transaction see note 2 ix.
Additionally the Group has 14m 2007: 81m of commitments to purchase forward carbon allowances at 31 March 2008.
At 31 March 2008, the Group had a net total of 9m 2007: 13m of forward contracts in place to economically hedge its exposure to movements in prices of Phase II carbon allowances.
There are potential future foreign currency receivables in respect of amounts outstanding from the sale of Bruce Power.
When these cash ows become more certain in the future, the Group will evaluate currency hedging opportunities.

The pattern of payments within the HLFA were xed subject to indexation by RPI at RED and will be funded by the Government under the Government indemnity.
Back End Fuel Costs Uncontracted Provisions for services relating to the disposal of associated nuclear waste of both PWR and AGR stations along with the storage and disposal of PWR spent fuel are based on cost estimates derived from the latest technical assessments.
Decommissioning The costs of decommissioning the power stations have been estimated on the basis of on-going technical assessments of the processes and methods likely to be used for decommissioning under the current regulatory regime.
The estimates are designed to re ect the costs of making the sites of the power stations available for alternative use in accordance with the Groups decommissioning strategy.
Accounting Life Extension During the year ended 31 March 2008 the discounted decommissioning liabilities reduced following the extension of the accounting lives of Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B power stations by five years to 2016.
As a result of the accounting life extensions, the level of undiscounted estimated nuclear decommissioning liabilities remains unchanged, however, the decommissioning workstreams will occur later, therefore reducing the discounted nuclear decommissioning liabilities by 125m.
The Government has indemni ed the Group for any future shortfall of NLF funding in respect of qualifying decommissioning costs and therefore the reduction in discounted nuclear decommissioning liabilities is fully offset by a corresponding decrease in the NLF receivable.
As a result there is no net revalorisation impact for this change in the consolidated income statement.

The differences between the discounted amounts and those accrued to date will be charged to the consolidated income statement over the remaining station lives since they relate to future use of fuel.
Under the terms of the contracts with BNFL referred to above and in accordance with the projected pattern of payments for decommissioning and other liabilities, taking account of the decommissioning fund arrangements described in note 2 xx, the undiscounted payments in current prices are expected to become payable as follows: Back end Back end fuel costs fuel costs Decom- 2008 2007 contracted uncontracted missioning Total Total m m m m m Within five years 1,040 16 17 1,073 1,225 610 years 891 32 933 1,856 1,828 1125 years 778 153 2,417 3,348 3,141 2650 years 390 1,256 1,646 1,632 51 years and over 2,182 4,734 6,916 6,674 2,709 2,773 9,357 14,839 14,500 26.

Provisions for Other Liabilities and Charges continued i Contracts Provision The Groups portfolio of commodity contracts was fair valued at RED as part of the application of acquisition accounting.
The net contracts provision is being utilised over the lives of the contracts fair valued at RED and is expected to be fully utilised by 2011 with the current portion of 17m expected to be utilised within the next 12 months.
The provision utilisation of 2m 2007: 76m is presented in the other operating income line of the consolidated income statement.
Other operating income also includes an 8m 2007: nil realisation of a contingent asset relating to the Groups disposal of its interest in Bruce Power LP.
For the year ended 31 March 2007 a release of 17m was also presented in the other operating income line of the consolidated income statement.
ii Other Provisions Other provisions are made up of severance provisions, provisions for onerous leases, a provision for additional unfunded retirement bene ts see note 27 and a provision for Eggborough site restoration costs.
2m 2007: 10m of the other provisions is expected to be utilised within the next 12 months in relation to severance and onerous leases.
Accordingly, this is classi ed as a current liability.
The remainder of the other provisions are classi ed as non-current.
Retirement Bene t Obligations i Pension Schemes The Group operates two separate fide ned bene t pension arrangements in the UK within the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS, the British Energy Generation Group BEGG for the majority of employees and the British Energy Combined Group BECG for the employees at Eggborough power station.
The ESPS is a fide ned bene t scheme, which is externally funded and subject to triennial actuarial valuation.
Each pension group that participates in the ESPS is nancially independent from the other groups.
The cash funding requirements of the pension schemes are determined by triennial actuarial valuations by the independent scheme actuaries.
The most recent triennial valuations of the BEGG and BECG schemes were carried out at 31 March 2007 and have been agreed by the Trustees.
Any fide ciency disclosed in the BEGG or BECG schemes following a triennial actuarial valuation will be funded by the Group.
The balance sheet valuations for accounting purposes under IAS 19 have been carried out by a separate independent actuary using the projected unit method.
ii Contributions The Group contributed 22.4% 2007: 22.4% to the BEGG pension scheme and 19.7% 2007: 19.7% to the BECG pension scheme as employers normal contributions for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Members who do not participate in the salary conversion arrangement and who are required to pay employee contributions contribute 5% 2007: 5% and 6% 2007: 6% to the BEGG and BECG schemes respectively.
Members who participate in the salary conversion arrangements have their salaries reduced by 5% 2007: 5% or 6% 2007: 6% depending on whether they are members of the BEGG or BECG scheme, these monies being paid to the BEGG and BECG schemes as additional employer contributions.
Additional agreed employer contributions were paid towards the BEGG schemes funding fide cit of 20m for the year ended 31 March 2008 2007: 20m.
For the year ended 31 March 2007, 40m of agreed accelerated contributions was also paid towards the BEGG schemes funding fide cit.
The Group made additional employer contributions of 1m 2007: 1m to the BECG scheme in the year.
The 31 March 2007 triennial actuarial valuation of the BEGG scheme has been agreed with a funding fide cit of 174m at that date.
From 1 April 2008 the rate of employers regular contributions for future service bene ts under the BEGG scheme increased from 22.4% to 27.3%.
Additional employer contributions will be paid towards the BEGG schemes funding fide cit at a rate of 35m per annum paid monthly from 1 April 2008 until 31 December 2013.
The requirement for additional contributions will be reviewed as part of the next triennial valuation as at 31 March 2010.
The 31 March 2007 triennial actuarial valuation of the BECG scheme has been agreed with a funding fide cit of 3m at that date.
From 1 April 2008 the rate of employers regular contributions for future service bene ts under the BECG scheme increased from 19.7% to 22.2%.
The Group will continue to make additional employer contributions towards the BECG schemes funding fide cit, having regard to appropriate funding advice.
The Group expects to contribute a total of 119m, including additional employer contributions, to the schemes in the year ending 31 March 2009.
At 31 March 2008 there was 7m 2007: 7m of contributions owed to the pension schemes included in accruals.

These obligations are unfunded and the liability recorded at 31 March 2008 was 6m 2007: 5m and is included within other provisions see note 26. iv Plan Assets, Expected Rates of Return and Bene t Obligations Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Opening fair value of plan assets 2,671 2,455 Expected return on plan assets see note 10 182 164 Actuarial losses gains 145 6 Contributions by employer 85 125 Contributions by plan participants 8 7 Benefits paid 91 86 Closing fair value of plan assets 2,710 2,671 The plan assets include investments in the Groups equity, amounting to less than 1% 2007: less than 1% of plan assets.
The major categories of plan assets and their expected rates of return are as follows: 2008 2007 Expected Expected return 2008 return 2007 % m % m Equities 8.00 1,188 8.30 1,326 Bonds 5.20 1,054 4.80 865 Property 6.25 241 6.55 270 Hedge funds 6.50 107 6.80 103 Other 5.00 120 5.00 107 Total 2,710 2,671 The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption was developed with consideration to the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily Government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The actual return on plan assets was 37m 2007: 170m, 145m less than 2007: 6m more than the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year.

The interest cost and expected return on plan assets are included in finance charges in the consolidated income statement.
vii Amounts Recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense Amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in respect of the retirement bene t obligations are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2008 2007 m m Actual return less expected return on pension plan assets 145 6 Experience gains losses arising on defined benefit obligations 17 25 Changes in assumptions underlying present value of defined benefit obligations 70 88 Net actuarial losses gains on retirement benefit obligations for the year 198 69 The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses, before deferred tax, recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in respect of funded retirement bene t obligations is a net gain of 41m 2007: 239m.
An actuarial loss of 1m 2007: 1m has also been recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in respect of the unfunded pension scheme, therefore the total actuarial loss taken to equity is 199m 2007: 68m gain see note 31.

Called Up Share Capital continued On 30 May 2007 the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry now the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform announced his intention to direct the NLF to convert and sell part of its interest in British Energy Group plc.
Following the partial conversion and share issue the Cash Sweep Payment percentage was reduced to approximately 36% and resulted in the recognition of a conversion asset of 2,340m, additional equity share capital of 45m and additional share premium of 2,295m representing the excess of the partial conversion share price of 5.20 over the nominal value of shares issued.
The conversion asset represents the fair value of the obligation which was removed as a result of the partial exercise of the conversion right.
Ordinary Shares The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to be paid any pro ts of British Energy Group plc available for distribution and determined to be distributed.
On the winding up of British Energy Group plc, holders of ordinary shares will be entitled to receive the nominal capital paid up or credited as paid up on the shares together with any further amounts available to be paid which will be allocated proportionately to holders of ordinary shares.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive notice of general meetings and to attend, speak and vote at such meetings.
Convertible Shares The NLF has the right from time to time to convert all or part of its entitlement to the Cash Sweep Payment into convertible shares in British Energy Group plc the NLF conversion right.
Subsequent to a conversion, the NLF may dispose of its convertible shares which on disposal become ordinary shares at any time subject to certain restrictions.
Amongst other things, the NLF may not exercise the NLF conversion right or dispose of any convertible shares if such disposal would require British Energy Group plc to have produced listing particulars or a prospectus more than five times in a consecutive period of 7.5 years.
The convertible shares may only be held by Nuclear Liabilities Fund Limited or its successor in title, a Minister of the Crown, the Treasury, a department, non-departmental body or other agency of the Crown, any body corporate established by statute some or all of the members of which are appointed by a Minister of the Crown or other UK Government entity or any person directly or indirectly wholly-owned by, or held on trust for, the Secretary of State or other Minister of the Crown.
Save in respect of voting rights, the convertible shares have the same rights, are subject to the same restrictions and rank pari passu with the ordinary shares of British Energy Group plc in all respects.
The number of votes that the holder of the convertible shares is entitled to exercise in respect of its holding of convertible shares is the lesser of: i 29.9% and, for this purpose, taking into account the voting rights attributable to any other ordinary shares held or acquired by any person acting in concert with the holder : and ii the number of convertible shares which the holder would otherwise be entitled to vote if the convertible shares were ordinary shares.
The convertible shares will convert into ordinary shares of British Energy Group plc automatically on transfer to a third party by the holder but are not convertible at the election of the holder prior to such a transfer.
Special Rights Redeemable Preference Share of 1 The Special Share is redeemable at par at any time after 30 September 2006 at the option of the Secretary of State, after consulting British Energy Group plc.
This share, which may only be held by and transferred to one or more of Her Majestys Secretaries of State, another Minister of the Crown, the Solicitor for the affairs of Her Majestys Treasury or any other person acting on behalf of the Crown, does not carry any rights to vote at general meetings, but entitles the holder to attend and speak at such meetings.
The Special Share confers no rights to participate in the capital or pro ts of British Energy Group plc beyond its nominal value.
The consent of the holder of the Special Share is required for certain matters including the alteration or removal of the provisions in British Energy Group plcs Articles of Association relating to the Special Share and to the limitations on shareholdings.
In addition, consent of the holder of the Special Share is required in relation to, amongst others, certain amendments to the Articles of Association of British Energy Bond Finance plc, British Energy Limited, British Energy Generation Limited or British Energy Generation UK Limited, or a disposal by British Energy Group plc of its shares in these companies.
However, the holder of the Special Share will only be entitled to withhold consent to such an amendment or disposal if, in the holders opinion, the matter in question would be contrary to the interests of national security.
The Articles of Association include full details of these restrictions.

The Warrants are freely exercisable at the option of the Warrant holder.
The subscription rights may be exercised at any time in respect of certi cated Warrants on lodging of a duly completed subscription notice and remittance of the subscription price or, in respect of Warrants held in uncerti cated form, if CREST Co. Limited receives a properly authenticated dematerialised instruction and payment through CREST in accordance with its rules.
The Warrants entitle the holder to subscribe to acquire an equivalent number of ordinary shares at a subscription price of 0.98 per share within five years of Restructuring.
Own Shares The Group has investments in its own shares, held in relation to the Groups share incentive schemes, through shareholdings held by British Energy Employee Share Trust and Abbey National AESOP Trust.
The value of these shares is presented within total equity.
The maximum number of own shares held during the year was 1,946,438 2007: 1,497,849.

As a result of the partial conversion by the NLF on 6 June 2007 additional share premium of 2,295m was recognised during the year see note 30.
On 22 October 2007 the Court of Session in Edinburgh approved a 2,295m reduction of British Energy Group plcs share premium account, thereby creating distributable reserves of this value.
The reduction of the share premium reserve by 2,295m equates to the amount of new share premium created in relation to the NLF partial conversion.

Equity continued iii Capital Reserve The Restructuring involved bondholders and signi cant creditors compromising their claims against the Group in exchange for, amongst other things, the issue of Bonds see note 23 by British Energy Bond Finance plc a wholly-owned subsidiary of British Energy Group plc and new ordinary shares of British Energy Group plc.
The capital reserve was created on the issue of shares at RED and represents the excess of the fair value of the claims of the signi cant creditors and bondholders over the legal liability foregone.
The capital reserve is not distributable.
iv Hedge Reserve The 102m loss 2007: 46m gain in the hedge reserve in the year re ects the fair value movement, before the deferred tax credit of 30m 2007: 14m charge, of the contracts that have been designated as cash ow hedging instruments.
This movement comprises an 84m net loss 2007: 3m gain on hedging instruments recognised in the year, plus an 18m loss 2007: 43m gain relating to amounts released from the hedge reserve as contracts are delivered and included in the consolidated income statement see note 22.
Where hedge accounting is permitted, gains and losses on hedging instruments are recognised directly in equity until the contract is settled, at which point the gain or loss is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
When trades are fide-designated as hedging instruments, cumulative gains or losses are retained in equity until the forecast transaction is settled.
v Warrant Reserve On Restructuring the shareholders in British Energy plc were entitled to receive Shares and Warrants in British Energy Group plc.
The Warrants entitle the holder to subscribe for ordinary shares in British Energy Group plc within five years of the Restructuring.
As the Warrants are exercised this reserve will be transferred to share capital and the share premium account.
During the year, 6,955,809 Warrants 2007: 6,399,439 were exercised resulting in an increase of 6,955,809 ordinary shares 2007: 6,399,439, an increase to share premium of 19m 2007: 16m and a reduction in the warrant reserve of 12m 2007: 11m.
The proceeds received in the year in relation to the exercise of the Warrants amounted to 7m 2007: 6m.
vi Retained Earnings Total income and expense in the year comprises the pro t attributable to shareholders of 335m 2007: 465m, net actuarial gains and losses on retirement bene t obligations for the year of 199m loss 2007: 68m gain and related deferred tax credit of 60m 2007: 21m charge.
An equity dividend of 140m 2007: nil was paid to ordinary shareholders from retained earnings during the year see note 13.
As discussed above, 2,295m 2007: nil has been credited to retained earnings in relation to the approved capital reduction.
Under IFRS 2 6m 2007: 2m has been credited to retained earnings in relation to the Share Incentive Plan, the Deferred Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Deferred Bonus Plan see note 33.

Share-based Payments The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year ended 31 March 2008 was 6m 2007: 2m see note 6 and related entirely to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Details of each of the employee share plans are given below.
Share Incentive Plan Under the Share Incentive Plan SIP, employees, including the Executive Directors, who are resident in the UK and meet the service requirements, are eligible for awards under the SIP.
Awards under the SIP are limited each year by relevant tax legislation and for the year ended 31 March 2008 will take the form of free shares.
The value of the annual award is linked to performance conditions and in respect of the year ended 31 March 2008 these performance conditions related to cost control, unplanned losses and length of the xed nuclear book.
These are considered to be non-market conditions under IFRS 2 and dividends attach to the awards, therefore the shares are fair valued at the market value on the date of grant.
The free shares are initially held in a trust and vest unconditionally for participating employees after being held within the trust for three years contingent upon participants being in continued employment by the Group.
Any dividends paid on shares held within the trust are converted into additional shares.

Deferred Incentive Plan The Deferred Incentive Plan DIP is available to selected senior employees who are eligible to receive conditionally awarded options in shares in British Energy Group plc at nil cost.
The share options vest over a period of between one and three years from the date of grant dependent on the percentage of performance targets achieved and the contractual life of each option granted is 10 years.

Share-based Payments continued Share Option Schemes Granted by British Energy Limited Share options were granted in previous years by British Energy Limited.
Legal advice has been obtained to the effect that the changes in the corporate structure of the Group as a result of the Restructuring did not trigger the early exercise provisions under these options.
The Remuneration Committee decided not to allow holders of the options in British Energy Limited to roll them over into options over shares in British Energy Group plc.
The options granted by British Energy Limited are still capable of exercise, but immediately on exercise the shares will be converted into shares in British Energy Group plc in the ratio of 50:1.
Accordingly the effective exercise price of the options is signi cantly higher than the current share price and it is unlikely the options will be exercised.
Contingent Assets The Group has certain contingent assets as a result of its disposal of its 82.4% interest in Bruce Power LP.
During the year the Group received a payment of C$15m as additional consideration in respect of the restart of Bruce A Units 3 and 4.
This has been recognised within the consolidated income statement in other operating income see note 26.
The treatment of expenditure at the Bruce Power Station during the period of the Groups part ownership is currently being considered by the Canadian tax authorities and could result in a rebate of a material amount of tax to the Group see note 35.
Contingent Liabilities On 12 February 2004 British Energy Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited received a notice of warranty claims from the consortium which purchased the Groups 82.4% interest in Bruce Power LP alleging breach of certain warranties and representations relating to tax and to the condition of certain plant at the Bruce Power Station.
The principal tax claim relates to the treatment of expenditure at the Bruce Power Station during the period of the Groups part ownership and is currently being considered by the Canadian tax authorities.
The treatment proposed by the Group could result in a rebate of a material amount of tax to the Group that has not been recognised in the consolidated financial statements: it is impracticable to provide an estimate of the potential amount of the tax rebate.
The consortium claims that allowance of the expenditure for that period would cause it to lose future deductions.
British Energy International Holdings Limited has rejected the tax claim and expects to defend it if it is pursued further.
The Group is con dent that the amount of the claim should not, in any event, materially exceed the amount of the rebate, and that the tax claim should have no material cash ow impact on the Group.
The claim relating to the condition of the plant is based upon alleged erosion of certain parts of the steam generators, including the support plates, through which boiler tubes pass, which it is alleged resulted in an extended outage of one unit at the plant to carry out repair works and loss of revenues and costs of approximately C$64.5m.
The consortium also claims that the alleged erosion may reduce the operating life of the unit and or result in further repairs involving further losses.
On 10 February 2006, British Energy Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited led a Notice of Action against Ontario Power Generation OPG and Bruce Power LP with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice seeking a contribution and indemnity from OPG and Bruce Power LP with respect to any amounts for which British Energy Limited or British Energy International Holdings Limited may be found liable as a result of the steam generator claim brought on 12 February 2004 by the consortium which acquired British Energy Limiteds 82.4% interest in the Bruce Power plant.
On 7 December 2006, the consortium served a notice of arbitration on British Energy Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited in relation to the purchase price payable by the consortium on the purchase of Bruce Power LP.
Under the disposal arrangements, the parties agreed a post-completion adjustment to the purchase price to account for the value of the Bruce Power pension plan as determined by a mutually appointed actuarial adviser, Watson Wyatt.
The consortium alleges that the valuation was incorrect, resulting in British Energy bene ting by C$23.1m which the consortium is now claiming together with interest and costs.
The consortium has also commenced legal proceedings against Watson Wyatt, David Proctor an actuary and one of their employees and Mebs Merali an actuary and former employee who were responsible for evaluating the Bruce Power pension plan and post-completion adjustment to the purchase price payable by the consortium.
On 15 May 2007 Watson Wyatt and David Proctor served notice of a third party action on British Energy Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited seeking an indemnity against any amounts for which they may be found liable.
On 11 September 2007 Mebs Merali served a similar notice on British Energy Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited.
The Group expects to defend the claims.
British Energy Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited commenced a fourth party claim against Bruce Power LP and Bruce Power Inc in respect of the third party claim by Watson Wyatt and David Proctor and a separate third party claim by Mebs Merali on 21 February 2008 and 20 February 2008 respectively, seeking a contribution, indemnity and relief from any damages costs for which British Energy Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited may be found liable or incur in the third party claims or the arbitration by the consortium.
The arbitration proceedings in the claim by the consortium commenced on 10 March 2008.

Contingent Liabilities continued Under the agreement with the consortium C$20m is retained in trust to meet any representation and warranty claims, and this may be retained pending agreement or determination of the claims.
The Group has given certain indemnities and guarantees in respect of its subsidiary undertakings.
No losses are anticipated to arise under these indemnities and guarantees, provided relevant subsidiary undertakings continue on a going concern basis.
The Group is involved in a number of other claims and disputes arising in the normal course of business which are not expected to have a material effect on the Groups financial position.

At 31 March 2007 3m tonnes with an approximate value of 116m fell due within one year and 1m tonnes with an approximate value of 23m fell due after more than one year but not more than three years.
In addition to the liabilities and provisions recognised and described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Group has provided certain guarantees and commitments in respect of the extent of capital expenditure by Eggborough Power Limited.
The Group also enters into commitments to purchase and sell electricity in the normal course of business.
The Group has a commitment to make the Cash Sweep Payment as described in note 2 xviii.
Therefore, it is only recognised and provided for when it becomes determinable.

Related Parties British Energy Group plc is a public limited company owned by the Companys shareholders and operates within an extensive contractual framework established as part of the Restructuring.
The most signi cant contract, in terms of the limitations it places on the business, is the Contribution Agreement between the Secretary of State and British Energy Group plc.
Within this contractual framework, British Energy Group plc is managed independently by the Board, which continues to direct the nances and operating policies of the Group and is subject to the normal private sector disciplines, duciary duties and Companies Act requirements.
British Energy Group plc considers that no party is a controlling party under the terms of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures IAS 24.
The following transactions were carried out with related parties: i Entities with Signi cant In uence over the Group The Group considers Her Majestys Government HMG to be a related party due to the signi cant in uence exercised by HMG following the Groups Restructuring.
The following transactions took place during the year with HMG and sponsored bodies under its control: HMG meets the Groups historic contracted nuclear liabilities to BNFL, a Government controlled body.
The nuclear liabilities receivable is recognised on the consolidated balance sheet in relation to these liabilities and decreased from 2,223m at 31 March 2007 to 2,168m at 31 March 2008.
The Group made payments to the NLF of 24m 2007: 29m.
The payments were in relation to xed decommissioning funding contributions of 23m 2007: 22m and 1m 2007: 1m in respect of the Groups share of the NLFs administration costs.
In the year ended 31 March 2007 a payment of 6m was made in respect of PWR fuel loaded into Sizewell B reactor, with no equivalent payment made in the year ended 31 March 2008.
The Group made payments to BNFL of 289m 2007: 295m during the year in respect of front and back end fuel costs.
In addition, under the Government indemnity in respect of historic nuclear liabilities, consideration of 205m 2007: 197m was passed to BNFL in the year.
The balance outstanding due to BNFL at the end of the year was 16m 2007: 16m.
Amounts due from the Group to BNFL at 31 March 2008 under the Historic Liability Funding Agreement amounted to 2,168m 2007: 2,223m.
The Group is required to make Cash Sweep Payments to the NLF depending on certain criteria being met.
See note 9 for further details.
The NLF, a Government controlled company, was issued with Bonds of 275m by British Energy Bond Finance plc as part of the Restructuring on 15 January 2005, however, as they are bearer bonds the Group is unable to con rm the total value held by the NLF at 31 March 2008.
The outstanding amount of Bonds issued to the NLF is included within the 405m of sterling bonds outstanding at 31 March 2008, see note 23 for further details.
The Group has also entered into a number of material transactions in its normal course of business with other sponsored bodies and departments of HMG including HM Revenue and Customs.
ii Key Management Personnel The compensation of key management personnel is set out in note 7.
Non-adjusting Post Balance Sheet Events On 21 March 2007, the Government announced its intention to phase out industrial buildings allowances with effect from 1 April 2008.
The phasing out of industrial buildings allowances was not included in the 2007 Finance Act and so is not considered to be substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
An estimate of the financial effect of this change, calculated at 28%, is that it would increase the net deferred tax liability by 37m to 82m.
