Funding and treasury risk management is undertaken through a central treasury department in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.
The risk management policies are designed to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance by identifying the various risks and setting appropriate risk limits and controls.
The Finance Committee, a committee of the Board, has on going responsibility for approving treasury activity and speci c financial transactions, the authority for which may be delegated.
The Treasury Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Of cer, regularly reviews risk positions and monitors performance.
The Group Audit Committee oversees management compliance with risk management policies and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Group Audit Committee is assisted in this role by Group Internal Audit who regularly undertake reviews of the Groups risk management controls and procedures.
The Group only uses derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures arising from an underlying current or anticipated business requirement and not for any speculative purpose.
The treasury department does not operate as a pro t centre.
Treasury operations in respect of Sainsburys Bank are managed separately through HBOS plc, the Groups other joint venture partner.
Liquidity risk The Groups operational cash ow is largely stable and predictable, re ecting the low business risk pro le of the food retail business.
Short and long-term cash ow forecasts are produced frequently to assist management in identifying liquidity requirements.
The Groups liquidity policy requires it to maintain committed funding to cover cash ow requirements over an 18-month period.
This is achieved by monitoring and pre-funding the Groups forecast operational cash ows and maturing debt obligations and by maintaining an adequate level of headroom through committed loan facilities.
The Groups core funding is represented by two long-term loans secured over property assets held in two subsidiary companies.
The loans comprise 1,159 million with a legal maturity of April 2018 and 867 million with a legal maturity of 2036.
The Group maintains a 400 million committed revolving credit facility maturing February 2012 to provide additional liquidity.
Interest on drawings under the facility is charged at a margin over LIBOR ranging from 37.5 basis points to 75 basis points linked to the Groups latest reported xed charge cover ratio.
There are nil drawings under this facility 2007: nil drawings.
The Group also maintains a 35 million net overdraft facility under which debit and credit balances of the various subsidiary accounts covered by the facility are netted for the purpose of charging interest.
The table overleaf includes the gross overdrawn balances within this facility and the offsetting cash balances under this arrangement are included within cash and cash equivalents, see note 27b.
Interest arising on any net overdraft balances is charged at one per cent above base rate.
The Group may also access uncommitted money market facilities for short-term funding requirements.
Interest on these facilities is charged at various spreads over LIBOR.
The table overleaf analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the tables are the contractual undiscounted cash ows or an estimation in respect of oating interest rate liabilities.

At 22 March 2008, 2 million relating to these financial instruments has been recognised in equity 2007: 85,000. Credit risk The Groups exposures to credit risk arise from holdings of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and investments in marketable securities.
The Group typically places surplus funds onto the wholesale inter-bank money markets, usually in the form of short-term xed rate deposits with approved banks and counterparties or into pooled Money Market Funds.
The Groups credit policy limits investments to banks or liquid securities which carry minimum short-term credit ratings of A1 from Standard & Poors and P1 from Moodys or, in the case of Money Market Funds, AAAm from Standard & Poors and Aaa from Moodys.
No more than 25 million may be invested with any individual bank counterparty and no more than ten per cent of a funds overall value may be deposited in a single Money Market Fund.
Individual credit limits are reviewed quarterly.
The total Money Market Fund balances shown below represent the use of two funds 2007: three funds.
The table below analyses the Groups cash and cash equivalents by credit exposure excluding bank balances, store cash and cash in transit: Counterparty 2008 2007 Rating m m Financial institutions - Money Market Funds AAAm Aaa 300 450 Financial institutions - Money Market Deposits A1 P1 11 60 Financial institutions - Money Market Deposits A1 P1 - 9 During the year there were no breaches of credit limits and management does not expect any losses from non-performance arising from counterparties used.
Market risk a Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk principally on future inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than pound sterling, primarily euros and US dollars but also Hong Kong dollars, Polish zloty, Australian dollars and New Zealand dollars.
The Group also has limited exposure in respect of recognised foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Groups risk management policy seeks to limit the impact of movements in exchange rates on Group income by requiring anticipated foreign currency cash ows in US dollars and euros to be hedged.
The future cash ows, which may be either contracted or uncontracted, are hedged on a layered basis between 80 per cent and 20 per cent using forward contracts over a 14-month time horizon.
The Group has limited exposure to currency risk on balances held on foreign currency denominated bank accounts, which may arise due to short-term timing differences on maturing hedges relative to supplier payments or obligations.
A ten per cent change in the value of the US dollar versus sterling at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant would have increased or decreased post-tax pro t or loss for the year by 20,000 2007: 300,000, as a result of gains or losses on translation of US dollar cash balances and US dollar denominated trade payables and receivables.
A ten per cent change in the value of euro versus sterling at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant would have increased or decreased post-tax pro t or loss for the year by 500,000 2007: 900,000, as a result of gains or losses on translation of euro cash balances and euro denominated trade payables and receivables.
Movements of this magnitude in the other currencies noted above would have an immaterial impact on both the income statement and equity.
67 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 J Sainsbury plc Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Financial risk management continued b Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its portfolio of interest bearing borrowings and deposits.
The Groups interest rate policy seeks to minimise interest expense and volatility by converting, with the use of financial derivatives, the interest rate pro le of underlying borrowings into a diversi ed portfolio of xed rate, oating rate and in ation-linked liabilities.
Policy fide fines neutral benchmarks of 35 per cent for xed rate debt, 25 per cent for oating rate debt and 40 per cent for capped in ation-linked debt, which may be varied within fide ned levels of tolerance.
In ation-linked cash ows arising on the Groups long-term borrowings remain an effective source of diversi cation within the liability portfolio, a hedge of the Groups revenues as well as a means of reducing balance sheet risk.
These cash ows arose as part of a general re nancing exercise undertaken in March 2006. i Fair value sensitivity for xed rate instruments The Group holds 1,159 million of xed rate debt 2007: 1,186 million, of which 602 million 2007: 782 million has been swapped into oating rate debt with interest rate swaps.
The remaining 557 million 2007: 404 million portion of xed rate debt is recorded at amortised cost and a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the income statement.
ii Cash ow sensitivity for variable rate instruments The 602 million portion of xed rate debt swapped to oating rates 2007: 782 million and the associated interest rate swaps have been designated as being in a hedging relationship.
The interest rate swaps and the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised at fair value through pro t or loss.
The two movements in fair values on the underlying xed rate debt and the interest rate swaps largely offset one another in the income statement.
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would have increased or decreased post-tax pro t or loss by 4 million 2007: 5 million representing the increased cost of the oating rate leg of the swaps.
For the year, the fair value movement in the interest rate swaps has resulted in a credit to the income statement of 25 million 2007: 39 million.
The fair value movement in the underlying xed rate debt has resulted in a charge to the income statement of 25 million 2007: 39 million.
The net movement is a credit to the income statement of 282,000 which represents ineffectiveness on this hedging relationship 2007: 24,000.
Interest rate swaps not held in a hedging relationship are recognised at fair value through pro t or loss.
An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have increased post-tax pro t or loss by 4 million 2007: 400,000.
A decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased post-tax pro t or loss by 10 million 2007: 8 million.
iii Cash ow sensitivity for in ation-linked variable instruments The Group holds 867 million of in ation-linked debt 2007: 863 million which is recorded at amortised cost.
A change of 50 basis points in the RPI at the balance sheet date would have increased or decreased post-tax pro t or loss by 3 million 2007: 2 million.
iv Fair value sensitivity for available-for-sale financial assets Included within available-for-sale financial assets is 105 million 2007: 136 million relating to the Groups bene cial interest in a property investment pool.
The net present value of the Groups interest in the various freehold reversions owned by the property investment pool has been derived by assuming a property growth rate of three per cent per annum and a discount rate of ten per cent see note 17.
A change of one per cent in the assumed rate of property rental growth to two per cent and four per cent, holding other assumptions constant, would result in values for this asset of 90 million 2007: 113 million and 130 million 2007: 163 million respectively.
A change of one per cent in the discount rate to nine per cent and 11 per cent, holding other assumptions constant, would result in values of 121 million 2007: 152 million and 92 million 2007: 113 million respectively.
c Pricing risk The Group operates risk management processes for other material costs associated with its activities, for example energy costs.
An energy risk management committee meets regularly to review pricing exposure to electricity and gas consumption and determines strategy for forward purchasing and hedging of energy costs.
The process undertaken is similar to that employed in purchasing foreign currency as described in section a above.
Capital risk management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital structure consistent with an investment grade credit rating to sustain investor con dence.
The Groups current credit ratings comprise a Corporate Family rating of Baa3 from Moodys and a Corporate Credit rating of BBB from Standard & Poors.
The Board monitors a range of financial metrics including return on capital and gearing to measure the ef ciency of the Groups capital structure, the returns for shareholders and bene ts for other stakeholders.
The Board has a policy to maintain the underlying earnings cover for the ordinary dividend at a minimum of 1.5 times and to grow the dividend cover over time to between 1.5 and 1.75 times.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Groups share option 68 programmes.
Outside of this practice the Group does not have a fide ned share buy-back plan.

Under the terms of the swap the Group pays a xed rate of 4.50 per cent and receives three-month LIBOR on 75 million until 19 April 2031.
The counterparty has a once only option to cancel the swap or double the notional principal value of the swap to 150 million on 19 July 2010 and thereafter a recurring option to cancel the swap on quarterly dates through to August 2030.
A swap outstanding in March 2007 with a notional principal of 100 million was cancelled by the counterparty in July 2007.
Interest rate swaps fair value hedge The Group has entered into three interest rate swaps to convert a total of 602 million 2007: 782 million of the xed rate secured loan due in 2018 to oating rates of interest note 20.
Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives xed interest at rates varying from 4.86 per cent to 5.22 per cent and pays oating rate interest at xed spreads above three-month LIBOR.
The notional principal amount of one of the interest rate swaps amortises from 421 million to 221 million from April 2016 to April 2018.
Foreign exchange forward contracts cash ow hedges At 22 March 2008, the Group held a portfolio of foreign exchange forward contracts with a fair value of 4 million 2007: 0.4 million to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk on its future foreign currency denominated trade purchases.
The Group had purchased 144 million 2007: 110 million and sold sterling at rates ranging from 0.68 to 0.97 2007: 0.68 to 0.71 with maturities from April 2008 to November 2008 2007: April 2007 to January 2008 and purchased US$237 million 2007: US$66 million and sold sterling at rates ranging from 1.93 to 2.05 2007: 1.79 to 1.98 with maturities from April 2008 to May 2009 2007: April 2007 to February 2008.
At 22 March 2008, an unrealised gain of 2 million 2007: loss of 0.1 million is included in equity in respect of these contracts.
This gain will be transferred to the income statement over the next 14 months from balance sheet date.
Interest rate risk Interest on financial instruments classi ed as oating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
In ation-linked debt is included within oating rate debt as the rate of interest is based on movements in the RPI and is therefore variable see note 20.
Interest on financial instruments classi ed as xed rate is xed until maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group and Company that are not included in the tables below are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

31 Retirement bene t obligations Retirement bene t obligations relate to two funded fide ned bene t schemes, the J Sainsbury Pension and Death Bene t Scheme JSPDBS and the J Sainsbury Executive Pension Scheme JSEPS and an unfunded pension liability relating to senior employees.
The fide ned bene t schemes were closed to new employees on 31 January 2002.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from the Groups assets.
The fide ned bene t schemes were subject to a triennial valuation carried out by Watson Wyatt, the schemes independent actuaries, at March 2006 on the projected unit basis.
The results of this valuation were approved by the schemes trustees in June 2007.
The retirement bene t obligations at 22 March 2008 have been calculated, where appropriate, on a basis consistent with this valuation.
The unfunded pension liability is unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised in the event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one-off cash payment.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Present value of funded obligations 3,668 4,395 Fair value of plan assets 4,171 4,298 503 97 Present value of unfunded obligations 8 6 Retirement bene t asset obligations 495 103 Deferred income tax liability asset 129 48 Net retirement bene t asset obligations 366 55 The retirement bene t asset or obligations and the associated deferred income tax balance are shown within different line items on the face of the balance sheet.

Consistent with the prior year, the discount rate is based on the annualised yield on an AA-rated sterling corporate bond index.
The combined life expectancy for both the schemes operated at the balance sheet date for a pensioner at normal retirement age now 65 years for men and 60 years for women is as follows: 2008 2007 years years Male pensioner 21.6 21.4 Female pensioner 23.1 22.9 The mortality assumptions used are the same as those adopted in the prior year.

The expected return for each asset class re ects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward-looking view of the financial markets as suggested by the yield available and the views of investment organisations.
The history of experience adjustments on the plans for the current and previous financial years is as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2005 m m m m Present value of retirement bene t obligations 3,676 4,401 4,368 3,512 Fair value of plan assets 4,171 4,298 3,710 2,976 Surplus fide cit 495 103 658 536 Experience loss on plan liabilities 79 236 27 6 Experience loss gain on plan assets 380 89 428 134 The expected contributions to fide ned bene t schemes for the next financial year beginning 23 March 2008 are 125 million.

The Group operates various share-based payment schemes as set out below: a Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The Group operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months continuous service.
This is an approved HMRC Scheme and was established in 1980.
Under the SAYE scheme, participants remaining in the Groups employment at the end of the three-year or five-year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price.
Employees leaving for certain reasons are able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.
At 22 March 2008, UK employees held 22,074 five-year savings contracts 2007: 21,833 in respect of options over 20.6 million shares 2007: 20.5 million and 28,332 three-year savings contracts 2007: 24,919 in respect of options over 15.3 million shares 2007: 14.1 million.

b Colleague Share Option Plan CSOP The Colleague Share Option Plan operates under the rules of the HMRC Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
Under the CSOP, participants are granted options to purchase shares of the Company at a stated exercise price.
The exercise of options is conditional upon participants remaining in the employment of the Group for a three-year period after date of grant.
Colleagues leaving employment for certain reasons have six months from their leaving date to exercise their options.
At 22 March 2008, a total of 10,547 UK employees 2007: 17,793 participated in the plan and held options over 3.4 million shares 2007: 5.7 million.
Options are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of the grant of option.
It is intended that there will be no further options granted under this plan.

The maximum annual option award was two times basic salary and the grants were agreed by the Remuneration Committee according to the assessed performance and potential of participants.
The exercise of options is conditional upon a performance target based on the growth in the Companys underlying earnings per share EPS relative to in ation over a three-year period.
EPS is measured against a xed starting point over the performance period beginning with the year in which the option was granted.
To the extent that the condition is not satis ed in full after three years, it will be retested on a xed-point basis over four and then five financial years.
To the extent the condition is not met after five financial years, the option will lapse.
Once the options vest, participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons, are entitled to exercise the options between vesting date normally at the end of the three-year performance period and the option expiry date, which is ten years from date of grant.

Under the PSP, participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons, were entitled to receive a grant of options after a performance period of three years to acquire the shares awarded to them, at any time during the ten years following the date of grant.
The participants entitlement to receive the grant depended on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR being the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested dividends, compared with a peer group of 11 companies namely Ahold, Alliance Boots, Carrefour, Casino, DSG International, King sher, Loblaw, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Next and Tesco, over the three-year performance period.
If the median performance of the TSR against the comparator group was not achieved at the end of the three-year performance period, the entitlement to receive the grant of options lapsed.
At median level, shares to the value of 30 per cent of salary would be released and the award will be pro rated at every position between the median and first position in the comparator group.
The maximum allocation for Directors was a conditional grant of shares equal to 75 per cent of salary.
No further allocations will be made under this plan.

The free shares are being held in a trust on behalf of participants and will be forfeited if participants cease to remain in the Groups employment for a period of three years.
Shares are released to participants within the first three years for certain reasons.
After the three-year period, the shares continue to be held by the trust for a further holding period of two years, unless they are released to participants upon cessation of employment with the Group.
A reconciliation of shares held in the trust is shown below: Number Number of shares of shares 2008 2007 million million Outstanding at beginning of year 1.5 1.7 Forfeited - 0.1 Released to participants 0.1 0.1 Outstanding at end of year 1.4 1.5 f J Sainsbury plc Share Plan 2005 Under the J Sainsbury plc Share Plan 2005, shares were awarded to participants on the conditional basis that the performance targets are achieved within the four-year performance period, from the financial year beginning 27 March 2005 until the financial year ending March 2009.
The levels of awards are scaled according to seniority and there is an opportunity for Executive Directors and eligible Operating Board members to make a personal investment of up to 50 per cent of salary in the plan.
The awards will vest if stretching sales and earnings per share EPS targets are achieved, as shown in table 1 below.
The relevant performance multiplier, which is on a sliding scale up to a maximum of five times, will be calculated and applied to the core award of shares, as well as the personal investment of shares i. e. shares acquired by Executive Directors and eligible Operating Board members.
Further, there is an opportunity for partial vesting of up to half the award, if the accelerated performance targets have been met at the end of year three i. e. financial year ended March 2008 as shown in table 2.
No awards will vest unless threshold levels of growth in both sales and EPS are achieved.
Once performance targets have been achieved, options will be granted to participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons to acquire the shares awarded to them, at nil cost.
The options will expire within a year after the end of the four-year performance period.

h Deferred Annual Bonus Plan The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, applies to the top levels of management including Executive Directors and currently comprises around 40 participants in total.
The first deferral took place in June 2007, in respect of the bonus awards for the financial year ended 24 March 2007.
The next deferral will take place in June 2008.
The Plan measures the Companys TSR performance over a three-year period against a bespoke UK and European retail comparator group comprising: Ahold, Carrefour, Casino, Delhaize, DSG International, Home Retail Group, King sher, Marks & Spencer, Metro, Morrisons, Next and Tesco.
Alliance Boots was removed from the comparator group following its fide-listing.
Up to two matched shares may be awarded for each share deferred depending on the extent to which the TSR measure is achieved.
No shares are awarded for below median performance, and the full match will only apply where the Company achieves first place within the comparator group.
At median position the match will be 0.5 shares for each deferred bonus share and the share match will be pro rated at every position between median and first place.
To the extent that the performance condition is met at the end of the three-year performance period, the matched shares will be added to the deferred bonus shares.
The deferred bonus shares and half of the matched shares can be accessed immediately, while the remainder will be held over for a further year.
Dividends or the equivalents will accrue on shares that vest.
