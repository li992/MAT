71 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 Financial Statements Notes 1.
Risk management Filtronas activities expose the business to a number of key risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives.
The principal risks faced by Filtrona and managements response thereto are summarised in the Business Review on pages 32 to 33.
The Board has overall responsibility for Filtronas system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of this system.
Such a system can only be designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can therefore only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Filtrona has a centralised treasury department to manage funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of derivatives that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
Filtrona uses derivatives only to manage currency and interest rate risk arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury department is subject to periodic independent reviews by the internal audit department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the Executive Directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographic presence, expertise and suitable credit rating.
The following describes Filtronas financial risk exposure and management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial asset or liability fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Filtrona has no significant individual concentrations of credit risk.
The following is an overview of how Filtrona manages its credit risk exposures.
Trade and other receivables Filtronas exposure to credit risk is driven by the profile of its customers.
This is influenced by the demographics of the customer base, including the industry and country in which customers operate, which is wide and diverse.
Filtrona monitors significant customers credit limits and there is an allowance for impairment that represents the estimate of potential losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The components of this allowance are a specific allowance for individual losses and a collective allowance for losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective allowance is determined based on historical experience.
Trade and other receivables are generally due from customers who are unlikely to seek credit ratings as part of their normal course of business.
The following table provides information on the trade and other receivables credit risk exposure.
2008 2007 m m Not impaired or past due: New customers less than one year 4.4 4.6 Existing customers more than one year with no defaults in the past 58.1 45.1 130 days past due not impaired 11.2 10.0 3160 days past due not impaired 2.5 1.7 6190 days past due not impaired 0.5 0.7 More than 90 days past due not impaired 0.6 0.5 Impaired 0.9 1.0 78.2 63.6 Trade and other receivables carried at 96.8m 2007: 79.8m include prepayments and accrued income of 6.9m 2007: 5.6m which are not financial assets.
Therefore, these amounts are excluded from the above analysis.
Trade and other receivables also include deferred consideration of 11.7m 2007: 10.6m due from the Itavema Group for the purchase of the Globalpack business.
This amount is also excluded as it is included in the credit ratings analysis below.
During the year impairment losses on trade and other receivables of 0.8m 2007: 0.6m have been recognised within net operating expense.
Derivative assets Credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally agreed standard form documentation exists.
The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored.
72 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 Financial Statements Notes continued 1.
Risk management continued Cash and cash equivalents Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents is monitored regularly on a counterparty by counterparty basis.
The credit limits imposed specify the maximum amount of cash which can be invested in or with any single counterparty.
These limits are determined by geographic presence, expertise and credit rating.
Filtrona monitors the credit ratings of counterparties.
The following credit risk table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of Filtrona by classifying deferred consideration, derivative assets and cash and cash equivalents according to credit ratings of the counterparties.
AAA is the highest possible rating and all of the assets are neither impaired nor past due.

ii Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of financial assets and liabilities.
Filtrona has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of either a 1%, 5% or 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points bp 100bp and 200bp in market interest rates.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results in the future may materially differ.
Filtrona is exposed to two types of market risk: currency risk and interest rate risk.
a Currency risk Filtrona publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies.
Therefore it is subject to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its operations and their transaction costs.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The majority of Filtronas net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Companys normal policy is to limit the translation exposure and the resulting impact on shareholders funds by borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets and by using forward foreign exchange contracts.
However, in response to the significant weakening of sterling against particularly the US dollar and euro in the fourth quarter of 2008 and to reduce the effect of currency movements on the Groups net debt, the Company temporarily suspended its normal policy and repaid substantially all of its US dollar and euro denominated financial liabilities and replaced them with sterling denominated debt.
As a result, at 31 December 2008, Filtronas net assets were exposed to the impact of foreign currency translation.
Transaction exposure hedging The majority of Filtronas transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and so transaction exposure is limited.
However, where they do occur, Filtrona uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 15 months.
Filtrona does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the Groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The Group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The following table shows Filtronas sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year all currencies average rates have been increased or decreased by 1%, 5% or 10%.
The translational effect on equity is limited as some US dollar 2007: all US dollar and euro exposure is hedged.
Accordingly the effect on equity is calculated by increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement in currency hedges.
It is assumed that all net investment and cash flow hedges will be 100% effective.

As a result of the temporary suspension of the normal net investment hedging policy in the fourth quarter of 2008, Filtrona repaid substantially all of its US dollar and euro denominated financial liabilities and replaced them with sterling denominated debt.
Consequently, most of the Companys US dollar and euro interest rate swaps and caps in place at 31 December 2008 were no longer effective in providing protection against increases in interest rates.
No sterling interest rate caps or swaps were taken out, and as a result, at 31 December 2008, Filtrona was exposed to the impact of any material adverse movements in sterling interest rates.
The following table shows Filtronas sensitivity to a 50bp, 100bp and 200bp decrease or increase in sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year the interest rates on all external interest bearing loans and deposits have been increased or decreased by 50bp, 100bp or 200bp and the resulting increase or decrease in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of Filtronas interest rate derivatives.
The effect on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of a 50bp, 100bp or 200bp decrease or increase in interest rates on the market values of Filtronas interest rate derivatives.
The impact on derivatives is estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.

iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Filtrona, although solvent, either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due.
Filtronas objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
Filtrona is mostly funded by a multi-currency syndicated 215m facility from its bankers.
The syndicated facility matures in May 2010.
In addition, during the year, the Company put in place additional bilateral facilities totalling US$40m, which mature in November 2009.
At 31 December 2008 the available bank facilities totalled 242.8m of which 198.1m was drawn down.
In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide short-term flexibility.
Amounts drawn by Filtrona on its committed facilities are subject to standard banking covenants.
Filtronas available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December were: 2008 2007 m m Expiring within one year 27.8 Expiring after one but within two years 16.9 Expiring after two years 57.2 44.7 57.2 Any loans drawn on these facilities would bear interest at floating rates with reference to LIBOR for the currency and period of the loan.

Risk management continued The maturity of Filtronas financial liabilities is analysed below.
All trade and other payables are due to be settled in less than six months.
Total financial assets and liabilities The table below sets out Filtronas accounting categories and fair value for each class of financial asset and liability.

Filtrona sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
Filtrona manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Filtrona may return capital to shareholders, through dividends and share buy backs as it did in 2007, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Filtrona monitors its capital structure on the basis of the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
EBITDA is defined as operating profit before depreciation, share option expense, intangible amortisation and exceptional acquisition fees 2007: depreciation, share option expense, intangible amortisation and restructuring costs from continuing operations.
During 2008, Filtronas strategy, which was unchanged from 2007, was to maintain the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.5.
The net debt-to-EBITDA ratios at 31 December were: 2008 2007 Note m m Net debt 21 182.1 135.2 Operating profit before intangible amortisation and exceptional acquisition fees 2007: intangible amortisation and restructuring costs 65.0 64.4 Plus depreciation 3 22.2 20.4 Plus share option expense 18 1.6 1.7 EBITDA 88.8 86.5 Net debt-to-EBITDA ratio 2.05 1.56 75 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 2.

The weighted average useful economic life of customer relationships and other intangible assets at the end of the year was 22.9 years and 12.1 years respectively 2007: customer relationships 23.6 years.
Filtrona tests intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment.
A discounted cash flow analysis is computed to compare the discounted estimated future post tax operating cash flows to the net carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets for each division or business as appropriate.
Goodwill is allocated to divisions as follows: Goodwill 2008 2007 Cash generating unit m m Protection and Finishing Products 29.8 23.3 Coated and Security Products 8.0 6.2 Plastic Profile and Sheet 28.9 21.2 Filter Products Porous Technologies 12.2 3.1 78.9 53.8 82 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 Financial Statements Notes continued 9.
Intangible assets continued Intangible assets, apart from goodwill, are allocated to the businesses to which they relate as shown below: Customer relationships and other intangible assets 2008 2007 Business Division m m Moss and Skiffy Protection and Finishing Products 24.1 19.1 Duraco Protection and Finishing Products 17.8 13.6 Lendell Porous Technologies 10.8 Multiple businesses Multiple divisions 0.6 0.7 53.3 33.4 The tests are based on the following assumptions: Cash flows for the following two years are based upon the Groups annual budget Cash flows beyond the budget period are based on year twos budget cash flows with zero growth The estimated cash flows are discounted using Filtronas weighted average cost of capital of 10.0% which equates to a pre tax discount rate of 14.3% Any impairments identified as a result of the analysis are charged to the income statement.
The test is dependent on management estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, and the discount rate applied to these cash flows.
The Group performed various sensitivity analyses which involved significantly reducing future cash flows.
The results of these analyses showed that, despite significantly lower post tax operating cash flows, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets continued to be supported.

Cash flow hedges are hedges of the currency and interest rate risk exposure to variability in cash flows.
Hedges of net investments are hedges of the currency risk exposure to changes in the carrying value of recognised investments in foreign operations.
Fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been calculated at year end forward exchange rates compared to contracted rates.
Fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by discounting cash flows at forward rates.
All other financial assets, classified as loans and receivables, and financial liabilities, classified as amortised cost, are held at amortised cost and have short terms to maturity.
For this reason, their carrying amounts at the reporting date approximate the fair values.
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and purchases will be transferred to the income statement when the forecast sales and purchases occur.
With the exception of the receipt of the Globalpack disposal consideration from the Itavema Group all of the hedged transactions are expected to occur over the next 15 months.
With the exception of the consideration discussed above, all other derivative instruments mature within the next 12 months.
At 31 December 2008 Filtrona had temporarily suspended its normal net investment hedging policy and had only US$30m of debt designated as a hedge of its net investments in subsidiary undertakings.
At 31 December 2007, Filtrona had US dollar denominated borrowings and US dollar and euro currency swaps which it had designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary undertakings.
The exchange gains of 0.8m on these borrowings and the gains of 0.4m on the US dollar currency swaps and losses of 4.4m on euro currency swaps were recognised in reserves at 31 December 2007.
Finance income and expense arising on financial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost are those amounts, excluding the expected return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities, detailed in note 4.
The only losses recognised on financial assets held at amortised cost are those detailed as impairment losses in note 1.

Employee benefits i Post-retirement benefits Trustees administer the schemes and the assets are held independently from Filtrona.
Pension costs of the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes as at 5 April 2006 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes have been updated to the balance sheet date from the most recent actuarial valuations taking account of the investment returns achieved by the schemes and the level of contributions.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices.
Defined benefit contributions in 2009 are expected to be 8.5m, which consists of payments to fund future service accruals and contributions to amortise the deficit in respect of past service.

Acquisitions On 17 October 2008, Filtrona acquired the assets and business of Lendell Manufacturing, Inc. Lendell based in St. Charles, Michigan, for a cash consideration of US$35m.
Lendell is a producer of speciality hydrophilic foam products for the medical, printing systems and personal care cosmetics markets and is highly complementary with Filtronas Bonded Fibre Components division.
Lendell contributed 1.1m to revenue and 0.3m to operating profit before intangible amortisation and exceptional acquisition fees.
It is estimated that if Lendell had been owned by the Group for the entire year it would have contributed 5.8m and 2.3m to revenue and operating profit before intangible amortisation and exceptional acquisition fees respectively.
On 3 May 2007, Filtrona acquired the assets and business of Duraco, Inc. Duraco based in Chicago, Illinois for a total consideration of 31.7m.
Duraco is a market leading manufacturer and supplier of self-adhesive foam products for protection and finishing applications in a broad array of served markets including point of purchase products and white goods.
Duraco contributed 9.7m to revenue and 2.3m to operating profit before intangible amortisation and restructuring costs in 2007.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired were adjusted to reflect their fair values to Filtrona.
The fair value adjustments are provisional and subject to finalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
The principal fair value adjustments are as follows: In 2008: The adjustment to property, plant and equipment reflects the open market value of the freehold property.
The adjustment to inventories reflects a fair value uplift in line with IFRS 3 and the impact of applying Filtrona Group accounting policies.
The adjustment to receivables reflects the impact of applying Filtrona Group policies.
In 2007: The adjustment to property, plant and equipment reflects the open market value of the freehold property.
The adjustment to inventories and receivables reflects the impact of applying Filtrona group accounting policies to these items.
The adjustment to deferred tax reflects the asset arising from a temporary difference between the accounting and tax base of property, plant and equipment.
The adjustment to provisions includes amounts relating to the reassessment of potential liabilities that were not fully recognised on acquisition.
