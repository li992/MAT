5 Exceptional items Exceptional items are those which, in the opinion of the Board, are material by size or nature, non-recurring, and of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement.
A full review of inventories has been performed and land write downs have been made where cost exceeds net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less all estimated costs of completion and overheads.
Estimated selling prices have been reviewed on a site by site basis and selling prices have been reduced based on local management and the Boards assessment of current market conditions.
These site reviews have resulted in land write downs totalling 112.5 million.
In addition option costs and related fees have been written down by 15.4 million to their net realisable value.
The Board has also reassessed the net realisable value of currently unsold part-exchange properties and has written down stock by 10% totalling 3.0 million.
The above has resulted in an exceptional charge totalling 130.9 million 2007 - nil.

8 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares held by the employee share ownership plans which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation except that the weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
It is assumed that all dilutive potential ordinary shares are converted at the beginning of the accounting period.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are outlined below: Pre-exceptional item Earnings Weighted Earnings Earnings Weighted Earnings average per share average per share number of number of ordinary ordinary shares shares 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 000 no.
A formal external valuation of investment properties was carried out at the end of the financial year.
The fair value of investment properties was assessed at 9,038,000 2007 - 6,519,000.
As noted above, the Group, in conjunction with external valuers, assessed the residual values as being highly likely to exceed cost and, in the event that costs exceed residual values, any excess would be viewed as not likely to be material in the Groups financial statements.
The Group has determined, therefore, that no depreciation should be charged 2007 - nil.
The investment properties are a proportion of the cost of residential units constructed by the Group, the units being sold under a shared ownership scheme.

None of the trade receivables are past their due dates 2007 - nil.
The other financial assets due after more than one year are recorded at fair value, being the amount receivable by the Group discounted to present day values.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is credited over the deferred term to finance income, with the financial asset increasing to its full cash settlement value on the anticipated payment date.
None of the other financial assets are past their due dates 2007 - nil.
Credit risk is accounted for in determining fair values and appropriate discount factors are applied.
The Group holds a second charge over property sold under shared equity schemes.
The other financial assets were held at amortised cost at 31 July 2007.
This change in accounting policy, which has been accounted for in the current year, does not have a material effect.

61 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Accounts continued 17 Financial risk management The Group's financial instruments comprise cash, bank loans and overdrafts and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main objective of the Group's policy towards financial instruments is to maximise returns on the Group's cash balances, manage the Group's working capital requirements and finance the Group's ongoing operations.
The Company's only financial instruments are Preference Shares.
Capital Management The Board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base to underpin the future development of the business in order to deliver value to shareholders.
The Group finances its operations through retained earnings, bank borrowings and the management of working capital.
From time to time, the trustees of the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 also purchase shares for the future satisfaction of employee share options.
Management of financial risk The main risks associated with the Group's financial instruments have been identified as credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Board is responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted, which have remained largely unchanged during the year, are set out below.
Credit risk The Group's exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There is no specific concentration of credit risk in respect of home sales as the exposure is spread over a number of customers.
In respect of trade receivables and other financial assets, the amounts presented in the balance sheet are stated after adjusting for any doubtful receivables, based on the judgement of the Group's management through using both previous experience and knowledge of the current position see note 14.
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counter parties before entering into a transaction.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period or subsequently and the Group does not anticipate any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
In relation to land payables, certain payables are secured on the respective land asset held as shown in note 16.
No other security is held against any other financial asset of the Group.
The Board considers the Group's exposure to credit risk to be acceptable and normal for an entity of its size given the industry in which it operates.
Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings and debt comprising bank overdraft facilities and borrowings.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring exisitng facilities and cash flows against forecast requirements based on a two year rolling cash forecast.
The Group's banking arrangements outlined below are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium term cash flow needs therefore mitigating the Group's liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk reflects the Group's exposure to fluctuations to interest rates in the market.
The risk arises because the Group's overdraft and floating rate bank loans bear interest based on either LIBOR or to the bank's base rate.
For the year ended 31 July 2008 it is estimated that an increase of 1% in interest rates applying for the full year would decrease the Group's profit before tax by 2.2m 2007 - 0.9m.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 62 Notes to the Accounts continued 17 Financial risk management continued Land purchased on deferred terms The Group sometimes acquires land on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39 the deferred creditor is recorded at fair value being the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the deferred term to finance expenses, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.
The maturity profile of the total contracted cash payments in respect of amounts due on land creditors at the balance sheet date is as follows: Balance at Total Within 1-2 2-5 More than 31 July contracted one year or years years 5 years cash payment on demand 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 31 July 2008 133,112 139,916 83,279 42,306 7,125 7,206 At 31 July 2007 160,023 167,397 113,121 33,679 17,995 2,602 The maturity profile of the total contracted payments in respect of financial liabilities excluding amounts due on land creditors shown separately above is as follows: Balance at Total Within 1-2 2-5 More than 31 July contracted one year or years years 5 years cash payment on demand 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans - floating rates 325,000 334,151 59,151 - 235,000 40,000 Bank loans - fixed rates 2,000 2,134 2,134 -- - Preference shares 20,000 31,400 -- - 31,400 Trade and other payables 115,404 115,404 115,404 -- - At 31 July 2008 462,404 483,089 176,689 - 235,000 71,400 Bank overdrafts 43,554 45,621 45,621 -- - Bank loans - floating rates 70,000 72,170 17,170 - 55,000 - Bank loans - fixed rates 4,000 4,403 2,269 2,134 -- Preference shares 20,000 33,300 -- - 33,300 Trade and other payables 169,615 169,615 169,615 -- - At 31 July 2007 307,169 325,109 234,675 2,134 55,000 33,300 The interest rate on the fixed rate borrowing and preference shares apply to the whole term of the relevant instruments.
No interest rate has been calculated for the imputed interest on land payables as this is an accounting transaction with no actual interest payment being made by the Group.
At the year end, the Group had 294.3m 2007 - 432.1m of undrawn bank facilities available.
The Company's only financial instruments are Preference Shares as disclosed in the maturity profile above.
Cash and cash equivalents This comprises cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with a maturity date of less than one month.
The amounts of cash and cash equivalents for the years ending July 2008 and July 2007 for both the Group and the Company are shown in note 21.
At 31 July 2008 the average interest rate earned on the temporary closing cash balance was 3.69% 2007 - 4.58%.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.

Financial liabilities A comparison of the book values and fair values of the Group's fixed rate preference shares and fixed rate bank loan at 31 July is as follows: 2008 2008 2007 2007 000 000 000 000 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value Preference shares - fixed rate 20,000 20,400 20,000 23,000 Bank loan - fixed rate 2,000 2,021 4,000 4,049 The fair value of the fixed rate preference shares is based on quoted mid-market prices at 31 July.
The fair value of the fixed rate bank loan is based on an indicative rate which could have been obtained on the market at 31 July.
In aggregate, the fair values of the Group's other financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their book value.

In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company is liable, jointly and severally with other members of the Group, under guarantees given to the Group's bankers in respect of overdrawn balances on certain Group bank accounts and in respect of other overdrafts, loans and guarantees given by the banks to or on behalf of other Group undertakings.
The Company has given performance and other trade guarantees on behalf of subsidiary undertakings.

The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 1 August 2005 and was updated on an approximate basis to 31 July 2008.
Contributions of 866,000 2007 - 909,000 were charged to the income statement for the defined contribution section of the Scheme.
With regard to the defined benefit section of the Scheme, the regular contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been 1,174,000, equivalent to approximately 32.7% of pensionable pay less members' contributions.
This level of contribution is to continue until reviewed following the triennial valuation of the Scheme due as at 1 August 2008.
The Company also paid special contributions amounting to 2,435,000.
Expenses were paid in addition.
It is the policy of the Company to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside the income statement and in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Insured pensions and defined contributions have been excluded from the assets and liabilities.

Expected long-term rates of return The expected long-term return on cash is related to bank base rates at the balance sheet date.
The expected return on bonds is determined by reference to UK long dated gilt and bond yields at the balance sheet date.
The expected rate of return on equities has been determined by setting an appropriate risk premium above gilt bond yields having regard to market conditions at the balance sheet date.

IFRS 2 has been applied to options granted after 7 November 2002, which had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Awards under the LTIP and the annual bonus scheme have been made to executive directors and the company secretary.
Share options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to directors in October 2003 and to other employees in November 2004.
No further options may be granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme 1996 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to employees in May 2006.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2005 Employee Share Option Scheme 2005 ESOS replaces the 1995 ESOS.
Awards may be granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors and are subject to performance conditions.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2007 Employee Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS replaces the 1996 ESOS.
It is an unapproved discretionary scheme which provides for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees and executive directors.
It is, however, the current intention that no executive directors of the Company should be granted options under the scheme.
Awards will be available to vest after three years, subject to objective performance targets.
Options issued under the SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
An outline of the performance conditions in relation to the above schemes is detailed under the long-term incentive scheme section on page 35 within the Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration.
For awards made prior to 16 January 2008, vesting of options under the LTIP is dependent upon total shareholder return of the Group measured against relevant comparator companies as detailed on page 35 within the Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration.
For awards made on 16 January 2008, vesting of options is dependent upon two conditions, total shareholder return and return on capital employed, as detailed on page 35 within the Report of the Board on Directors' Remuneration.
With regard to the annual bonus scheme, for awards up to and including those for the year ended 31 July 2006, one half is payable in November each year following the announcement of the Group's annual results.
The other half is used to acquire Bellway shares at the prevailing market value.
These shares are held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 for three years.
The shares can then be transferred into the employee's name.
In addition, various small share awards were made for years 2003 through to 2007 to employees, mainly at divisional management level.
These awards mainly had three year vesting periods.
Awards to executive directors and to the company secretary in relation to the year ended 31 July 2007, and subsequent years, are made in cash with no compulsory deferral element.
Shares in relation to the annual bonus scheme and the LTIP, which are held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 carry voting rights which are not exercisable by the employees until the shares vest.
Prior to this, the voting rights are exercisable by the trustees of the Trust.
Share options have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed below, based on publicly available market data at the time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.

These options were erroneously omitted from the figure for forfeited in the year ended 31 July 2007.
Valuation methodology For the LTIP, a Monte Carlo simulation method is used which allows the Group's performance, in terms of total shareholder return, to be measured against its comparator companies.
Individual share price volatilities are calculated for each of the comparator companies.
A correlation assumption, appropriate to the building sector, is also used.
In the case of the deferred element of the annual bonus, a simplified Black Scholes method is applied with an exercise price and dividend yield of zero.
This is because no performance conditions attach to the award and no dividends are credited to the individual.
The result is that the fair value equates to the face value of the award.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
For the 1995, 1996, 2005 and 2007 ESOSs, a lattice method is used which enables early exercise behaviour to be modelled in a more sophisticated manner than under Black Scholes.
Volatility levels for more recent years were considered to have more relevance than earlier years for the period reviewed.
The Group recognised total expenses of 1,685,000 2007 - 2,580,000 in relation to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
