GOODWILL Restated note 37 m Cost: At 1 April 2006 98.6 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries 38.9 At 31 March 2007 137.5 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries note 37 97.1 At 31 March 2008 234.6 Carrying amount: At 31 March 2007 137.5 At 31 March 2008 234.6 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash-generating unit CGU expected to benefit from that business combination.
All of the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the waste management segment which is considered to be a single CGU, as it is an integrated business.
Goodwill is reviewed annually or when other events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
The recoverable amount of the waste management segment is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions in those calculations relate to discount rates, cash flows, price increases and for landfill, the compaction rate.
Cash flow projections are based on approved budgets and plans for the next five years and beyond this period on long-term growth rates for the waste sector based on GDP.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax nominal discount rate of 13.2% which reflects the overall business risks associated with the waste management segment activities.
