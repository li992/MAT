Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with UK GAAP.
A cash flow statement has not been presented as permitted by FRS 1 revised Cash flow statements.
Fixed asset investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost less any provision for diminution in value.
Deferred taxation In accordance with FRS 19 Deferred tax, deferred taxation is provided fully and on a non-discounted basis at expected future corporation tax rates in respect of timing differences between profits computed for taxation and accounts purposes.
Own shares The cost of the Companys investment in its own shares which comprise shares held by the Kier Group 1999 Employee Benefit Trust for the purpose of funding of the Companys share option plans, is shown as a reduction in shareholders funds in retained earnings.
Share-based payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments under the Sharesave and LTIP schemes.
The fair value of these schemes at the date of grant is expressed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Financial instruments The Companys principal financial assets and liabilities are cash at bank and borrowings.
Cash at bank is carried in the balance sheet at nominal value.
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
