14 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust, the Employee Benefit Trust see note 24 and treasury shares, all of which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares from the start of the accounting period.
The Company has only one category of potentially dilutive ordinary shares being those share options and awards granted to directors and employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
In accordance with IAS 33, potential ordinary shares are only dilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or increase the loss per share from continuing operations.

50.0m of this amount represented the brand value of Charles Church, acquired with Beazer Group plc in 2001.
Acquired brand values are calculated based on discounted cash flows and are tested annually for impairment.
The remainder of goodwill is allocated to acquired strategic land holdings and is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the intangibles are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those regarding discount and growth rates.
Growth rates incorporate volume, selling price and direct cost changes.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolated for four years, to form the basis of the Groups five year business plan.
When performing the impairment review of the brands, the relevant retraction growth rates included therein vary between 9% to 18% 2007: nil to 2%, reflecting the current volatility of the UK housing market.
The retraction growth rates in relation to the impairment review of goodwill allocated to strategic land holdings vary between 6% to 8% 2007: nil to 2%.
After this period the retraction growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts vary between nil and 4% reflecting managements estimate of the forecast recovery in the UK housing market, which do not exceed the long term average growth rates for the industry.
Management used pre-tax discount factors between 7.0% and 10.0% 2007: 7.5% and 9.5% over the forecast period.
At the beginning of the financial year the fair value of goodwill was in excess of its book value.
Due to the deterioration in the UK housing market and the consequential impact of falling revenues on land values, at the year end the fair value is below book value.
The goodwill allocated to acquired strategic land holdings is further tested by reference to the proportion of legally completed plots in the period compared to the total plots which are expected to receive satisfactory planning permission in the remaining strategic land holdings, taking account of historic experience and market conditions.
This review resulted in an underlying impairment of 1.8m 2007: 2.4m.
The effect of testing goodwill for impairment in the manner set out is that the goodwill will be completely impaired once the final plot that management expects to receive a satisfactory planning permission, is sold.
As a result of the 2008 impairment review, the Group has an exceptional impairment charge against the goodwill arising from the purchase of Westbury plc of 188.0m and the Charles Church brand value of 13.0m, which have been recognised in the income statement.
On concluding the annual impairment testing, there remains 126.3m and 38.1m of Beazer and Westbury goodwill allocated to strategic land holdings and 37.0m allocated to the Charles Church brand.
In addition, there is 60.0m of carrying value in relation to the Westbury brand.
The remaining 2.2m represents goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs.
Acquired know how is amortised over its estimated useful life, which is 10 years from the date of its inception.
Due to the deterioration in the UK housing market the likelihood of impairment losses in the future has increased.

Following the exceptional impairment of asset values held by subsidiaries, a review was carried out to confirm the recoverability of the investment value in existing subsidiaries of Persimmon Plc.
As a result of this the carrying value was found to be impaired by 281.7m.
Details of Group undertakings are set out in note 32.

It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this is subject to a number of issues including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
During 2008 the Group conducted a review of the net realisable value of its inventories in light of the deterioration in the UK housing market.
Where the estimated net realisable value was less than its carrying value within the balance sheet the Group has impaired the inventory values.
Following the impairment 1,088.9m 2007: 96.8m of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
The value of inventories expensed in 2008 and included in cost of sales was 1,434.9m 2007: 2,163.6m excluding the 652.3m exceptional impairment.
Land with a carrying value of 389.5m 2007: 442.1m was used as security for land payables note 21.

The difference between the nominal and the initial fair value is credited over the deferred term to finance income, with the financial asset increasing to its full cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
Credit risk is accounted for in determining fair values and appropriate discount factors are applied.
The Group holds a second charge over property sold under shared equity schemes.
The impairment of the available for sale financial assets arises due to the impact on the fair value of these assets due to the decline in UK house prices and amounts to 4.9m in the period which has been charged as an exceptional item in the income statement.
Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in note 22.
Trade and other receivables are non-interest bearing, and the Group has no concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The Directors consider that the carrying value of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.
An allowance of 6.5m 2007: nil has been charged to profit and loss account exceptional items to recognise the impairment of individual trade and other receivables included in current receivables.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amounts of these receivables and the present value of any expected recoveries.

The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed terms.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.
Land payables are reduced for imputed interest, which is charged to the income statement over the credit period of the purchase contract.
22 Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Market risk Liquidity risk Capital risk Credit risk This note presents basic information regarding the Groups exposure to these risks and the Groups objectives, strategy and processes for measuring and managing exposure to them.
Unless otherwise stated references to Group should be considered to apply to the Company as well.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for risk management of the Group.
The Board has established the Risk Committee which has the delegated task of overseeing the Boards responsibility with respect to risk and internal control.
The Risk Committee reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Risk Committee is supported in this task by the Group Risk management function.
The Group Risk function performs an annual assessment of the risks faced by the Group.
This assessment is used to drive a risk focused programme of work aimed to improve business processes and increase internal control effectiveness.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2008 61 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial risk management continued Market risk Market risk represents the potential for changes in foreign exchange prices and interest rates to affect the Groups profit and the value of its financial instruments.
It also incorporates the effect of the overall UK housing market on the Group.
The Groups objective in market risk management is to minimise its exposures to fluctuations within such variables whilst optimising returns.
The Group has entered into a number of hedge derivative arrangements to limit its exposure to these risks, particularly exchange risk.
The Group enters into such transactions only as part of periodic wider refinancing undertakings to take advantage of the mature private placement markets in other countries notably the USA and only with the approval of the Board of Directors.
The Group applies hedge accounting to these arrangements in order to minimise profit and loss volatility.
Currency risk The Groups currency risk principally resides in senior loan notes issued in US Dollars and Euros to institutional investors.
The Group has entered into hedge arrangements for all such loan notes swapping them into Sterling on issue.
These hedges match the contractual maturity of all principal payments and also match foreign currency contractual interest payment maturities, swapping these to either fixed Sterling payments designated cash flow hedges or Sterling payments linked to UK LIBOR designated fair value hedges.
In this manner the Groups foreign currency senior loan notes cash flows are effectively hedged to mirror those of either a fixed or floating rate Sterling denominated loan.
The Group also has investments in a number of Portuguese jointly controlled entities.
These interests are not hedged.
These investments are considered to be long term in nature.
The Group has no other significant currency exposures.
The following exchange rates applied during the year: 2008 2007 Average Year end Average Year end rate spot rate rate spot rate US Dollar 1.853 1.438 2.002 2.004 Euro 1.259 1.034 1.462 1.362 The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk may be summarised as follows: 2008 2007 USD Euro USD Euro $m bm $m am Investments 3.5 3.7 Senior loan notes 735.2 5.0 838.4 5.0 Forward exchange contracts 735.2 5.0 838.4 5.0 Net exposure 3.5 3.7 Sensitivity analysis The hedging arrangements in place over borrowings are such that the Groups profit will be unaffected by any reasonably expected variation in exchange rate at the reporting date 2007: nil.
A rise fall in the Euro Sterling exchange rate of 10% would result in a 0.3m loss gain in relation to investments.
Interest rate risk The Group holds a mixture of both fixed and floating interest borrowings to control its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group has no formal target for a ratio of fixed to floating funding.
The responsibility for setting the level of fixed rate debt lies with the Board of Directors and is continually reviewed in the light of economic data provided by a variety of sources.
Fixed rate borrowings are achieved by issuance of fixed rate GBP denominated senior loan notes and by interest rate swaps entered into as part of the hedging arrangements put in place for foreign currency denominated senior loan notes detailed under currency risk above.
Sensitivity analysis The Groups hedging arrangements are such that the Groups profit would be unaffected by any reasonably expected variation of the interest rate at the balance sheet date 2007: nil.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2008 62 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial risk management continued Housing market risk The Group is fundamentally affected by the level of UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
2008 has proved an exceptional year, with unprecedented falls in house prices, largely driven by the lack of availability of consumer mortgage lending.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate such risks on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance its investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
Furthermore the Group has taken steps to minimise its speculative build, restrict its land acquisition and reduce work in progress expenditure so as to manage the exposure of the Group to any continued market disruption.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups strategy to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid funds to meet all its potential liabilities as they fall due.
This is true not only of normal market conditions but also of negative projections against expected outcomes, so as to avoid any risk of incurring contractual penalties or damaging the Groups reputation, which would in turn reduce the Groups ability to borrow at optimal rates.
Therefore the Group ensures its continued compliance with financial covenants under both syndicated loan and private placement arrangements even under adverse market conditions.
The Group has entered into a number of deferred payment guarantees and performance bonds in the normal course of operations.
The liabilities to which these guarantees relate are recognised and accounted for in accordance with our standard accounting policies.
Liquidity forecasts are produced on i a daily basis to ensure that utilisation of current facilities is optimised: ii a monthly basis to ensure that covenant compliance targets and medium term liquidity is maintained and iii a long term projection basis for the purpose of identifying long term strategic funding requirements.
The Directors also continually assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group.
They consider the security of capital funding against the potentially higher rates of return offered by debt financing in order to set an efficient but stable balance appropriate to the size of the Group.
The Group operates short term uncommitted overdraft facilities to meet day to day liquidity requirements.
These facilities are cancellable on request from the bank: however the Group generally maintains low levels of borrowing on these in favour of more cost efficient facilities.
These overdraft facilities are provided by five leading clearing banks to minimise exposure to any one lender.
The Group has a syndicated revolving credit facility committed to November 2010, at a competitive rate linked to LIBOR.
Undrawn facilities at the reporting date amount to 735.0m 2007: 725.0m.
Refinancing As a direct result of the exceptional trading conditions under which the Group has operated during 2008 and its liquidity forecasts incorporating projections of these trading conditions into 2009, the Directors assessed that the Groups liquidity risk had increased in relation to compliance with the interest cover covenant based on income statement as set out in the terms of the Companys existing credit facilities.
Accordingly, the Directors have taken pre-emptive action to: amend certain covenants including but not limited to, the interest cover covenant now based on operating cash flows, conditions within the Groups funding arrangements and to reduce the level of committed facilities to reflect the Groups forecast requirements.
Further details are provided in note 34.
Capital risk The Groups objective in managing capital is primarily to ensure the continued ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst also maintaining an appropriate balance of equity and borrowings and minimising costs of capital.
Close control of deployment of capital is maintained by detailed management review procedures for authorisation of significant capital commitments, such as land acquisition, capital targets for local management and a system of internal interest recharges, ensuring capital cost impact is understood and considered by all tiers of management.
Decisions regarding the balance of equity and borrowings, dividend policy and all major borrowing facilities are reserved for the Main Board.

In the majority of cases the full cash receipt for each sale occurs on legal completion, which is also the point of revenue recognition under the Groups accounting policies.
In certain specific circumstances the Group has entered into shared equity arrangements not applicable to the Company.
The pressures of recent market conditions necessitated an increase in this form of sales structure during 2008.
In such cases the long term debt is secured upon the property concerned the Group does not recognise collateral rights as a separate asset, nor does it have rights to trade such collateral.
Recent reductions in property values have led to an increase in the credit risk of the Group in respect of such sales.
The charge for provision for credit impairment in the year amounted to 4.9m.
The maximum total credit risk is as follows: 2008 2007 Group m m Loans and receivables 86.0 95.3 Cash and cash equivalents 0.8 2.1 86.8 97.4 Company Loans and receivables including intercompany balances 253.5 246.9 253.5 246.9 The maximum credit exposure of the Group to overseas parties is 0.2m 2007: 0.5m Company nil 2007: nil.
The Groups credit risk is widely distributed.
The maximum credit risk should any single party fail to perform is 2.7m 2007: 4.6m Company 115.2m 2007: 114.7m being a subsidiary debtor.
This Group debtor is secured upon property.
The Directors consider these financial assets to be of high quality and the credit risk is assessed as low.

Where no such price is readily available then fair value is determined by discounting net forward cash flows for the residual period of the contract by a risk free rate.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2008 67 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial risk management continued Hedge accounting As outlined under currency risk above the Group operates two forms of hedging.
Certain US senior loan notes, along with all EU senior loan notes, are hedged using fair value hedges.
These hedge instruments effectively swap fixed US Dollar Euro interest payments for floating Sterling payments linked to UK LIBOR.
They also provide a forward swap for all capital repayments and therefore these instruments effectively hedge foreign exchange risk.
Other US senior loan notes are hedged via cash flow hedges.
These hedge instruments effectively swap fixed US Dollar Euro interest payments for fixed Sterling payments.
They also provide a forward swap for all capital repayments and therefore these instruments effectively hedge both foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The periods when the forecast cash flows relating to cash flow hedges will occur, and when they will affect profit are as follows: Group 2008 2007 m m Less than 1 year 0.4 8.1 1-2 years 0.1 1.0 2-5 years 17.4 Over 5 years Carrying value 0.3 26.5 There was no hedge ineffectiveness during the period.

Provision is made for the Directors best estimate of all known legal claims and all legal actions in progress.
The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed, or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
The Company has entered into guarantees of certain financial liabilities of related undertakings as detailed in note 33.

There are no minimum lease receipts as no lease is held under a non-cancellable agreement.
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office properties and motor vehicles.
Motor vehicles have an average term of 1.3 years to expiry 2007: 1.6 years.
Property leases have an average term of 9.1 years to expiry 2007: 10.9 years.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2008 73 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31 Employee benefits Retirement benefit obligation At 31 December 2008 the Group operated three employee pension schemes, a stakeholder scheme and two defined benefit schemes.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with IAS 19 Revised.
All pension scheme costs that are recognised in the income statement are reported as operating expenses.
Expected costs in relation to current employees are charged to the relevant operating business.
All other pension scheme costs are borne by the Company.
Persimmon Group Stakeholder Scheme The Persimmon Group Stakeholder Scheme is a defined contribution scheme available to new salaried employees.
The Group matches employees own contributions to their individual Stakeholder plans up to 9% of basic salary depending on the length of service.
Group contributions to this scheme of 1.2m 2007: 1.3m are expensed through the income statement as incurred.
Persimmon Plc Pension & Life Assurance Scheme The Persimmon Plc Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Persimmon Scheme is a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members in 2001.
The assets of the Persimmon Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
An actuarial valuation of the Persimmon Scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2008 by a professionally qualified actuary and adopted the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method the current service cost, as a percentage of Persimmon Scheme members pensionable pay, will increase as the active members approach retirement.
Standard 2000 mortality tables applying a medium cohort effect with an underpin of 1.25% p. a. for males and 0.75% p. a. for females were used as a basis to calculate the future liability.
Prowting Pension Scheme On acquisition of Westbury plc in 2006 the Group assumed control of the Prowting Pension Scheme the Prowting Scheme a defined benefit scheme.
The Prowting Scheme was closed to new members prior to the acquisition.
The assets of the Prowting Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
The most recent completed actuarial valuation of the Prowting Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2006 by a professionally qualified actuary and adopted the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method the current service cost, as a percentage of Prowting Scheme members pensionable pay, will increase as the active members approach retirement.
Standard 1992 mortality tables, appropriately adjusted and applying a medium cohort effect, have been used as a basis to calculate the future liability.
The assets of both defined benefit schemes have been calculated at fair value and the liabilities, at each balance sheet date, have been calculated based on the following financial assumptions figures presented are an aggregation of both defined benefit schemes : 2008 2007 % pa % pa Discount rate 6.10 5.80 General pay increases 3.50 3.90 Inflation assumption 2.90 3.10 Pension increases Limited Price Indexation 2.90 3.10 Expected return on Scheme assets: Equities 7.5 8.5 Bonds 4.9 5.3 Property 6.5 7.5 Cash 3.8 5.5 Persimmon Plc employs a building block approach in identifying the long term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long term rate of return on each asset class is set out above.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the scheme at 31 December 2008 and rounded to the nearest 0.1% per annum.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2008 74 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31 Employee benefits continued The major categories of scheme assets as a percentage of the total fair value of scheme assets are as follows: 2008 2007 % % Equities 60 64 Bonds 31 26 Property 2 Other 9 8 The amounts recognised in income are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Current service cost 4.8 6.7 Curtailment credit 2.1 Interest cost 19.4 18.3 Expected return on scheme assets 19.6 18.6 Total included in staff costs 2.5 6.4 Net actuarial loss gain 43.8 36.1 Total loss gain recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense in the period 43.8 36.1 Total defined benefit scheme loss gain recognised in the period 46.3 29.7 The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets is a weighted average of the individual expected rates of return on each asset class.

Share-based payment The Group operates a number of share option schemes, the details of which are provided below.
All schemes are equity settled.
In accordance with IFRS 2, only costs relating to options issued after 7 November 2002 have been charged to the income statement.
The Save AsYou Earn Scheme is an HMRC approved scheme open to all employees.
Options can normally be exercised three years after the date of grant.
Options have been issued to senior management including the executive Directors under the Groups various executive share option schemes, which includes two long term incentive plans LTIPs.
