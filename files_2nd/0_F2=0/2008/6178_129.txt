Retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme called The Forth Ports Group Pension Scheme that covers the vast majority of employees.
Other employees are covered by a national scheme.
The Nordic Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
The pension cost relating to The Forth Ports Group Pension Scheme was assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
The latest formal actuarial assessment of the scheme was as at 5th April 2008.
The actuaries have provided updated figures for the scheme as at 31st December 2008.
Assets are taken at their market value.
Liabilities are valued using various assumptions which are listed overleaf.
The total pension cost was 3.2m 2007 4.5m.
Member contributions are paid in addition.
A number of employees are members of The Former Registered Dock Workers Pension Scheme FRDW scheme.
The Group also has a contractual relationship with self-employed pilots who operate within the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Tay to provide pilotage services.
The self-employed pilots make payments into the Pilots National Pension Fund PNPF.
The FRDW scheme is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme which was set up many years ago on a national basis to provide pensions to Registered Dock Workers.
The most recent formal valuation of the FRDW scheme was carried out in 2007 which recorded a small surplus.
On an ongoing basis, it was fully funded.
The total assets and liabilities of the FRDW scheme are not assigned to specific employers.
On the basis that the FRDW scheme is fully funded, the Group does not believe that it has any exposure to this pension scheme.
The employers are not entitled to participate in any surplus arising in the FRDW scheme.
The contributions paid by the Group are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme as the Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme.
The Group contributions during the year were 0.0m 2007 0.1m.
119 The Company and Port of Dundee Limited PODL are the Competent Harbour Authorities in the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay respectively where they are responsible for the provision of pilotage services.
The pilotage acts are provided by self-employed pilots.
The Company and PODL have no liability arising under the PNPF Scheme on an ongoing basis, however, they may have a liability for certain members if the PNPF is wound up.
Neither Company is aware of any such intention to wind up the Scheme.
Both the Company and PODL have been notified by the Trustee of the PNPF Scheme that it has issued proceedings in the High Court in order to seek directions from the Court as to its liability under both the Rules of the Scheme and in law to make up the Schemes deficit.
The Court has set a trial date of January 2010 to hear the case.
As this case is extremely complex, it is not possible to state with certainty what the outcome is likely to be and, therefore, what financial effect, if any, there may be on PODL and the Company.
The employer contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme operated by the Nordic group of companies during the year was 0.1m 2007 part year 0.0m.
