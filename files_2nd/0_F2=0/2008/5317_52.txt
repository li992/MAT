4 Pension The UK defined benefit scheme is described in note 8 to the Group accounts.
The last actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2007 and has been updated to 31 March 2008 by a qualified independent actuary in accordance with FRS 17.
The deficit on the UK scheme is included within the balance sheet of RS Components Ltd, a subsidiary of Electrocomponents plc, as it is this company which employs the majority of the scheme members.
As allowed by FRS 17, the deficit has not been split between Electrocomponents plc and RS Components Ltd as it is not possible to do so, on a consistent and reasonable basis.
This disclosure therefore relates to the UK pension scheme rather than just the Electrocomponents plc part of it.
As part of the formal triennial valuation of the UK defined benefit pension scheme at 31 March 2007, which has been agreed in principle with the Trustee of the scheme, the Group considered the prospective future cost and volatility of the UK defined benefit scheme structure.
This has led to the Group concluding a consultation, on 3 April 2008, with the membership of the scheme over a number of proposed changes.
These changes are designed to reduce the cost and volatility of maintaining the UK defined benefit scheme going forwards and are intended to apply from June 2008.
