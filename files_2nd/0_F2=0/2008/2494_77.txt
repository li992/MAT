In addition to US litigation involving Group companies, which is covered by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company RJRT indemnity referred to in note 30, Reynolds American Inc. RAI group companies are named in litigation which does not involve Group companies.
While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse verdict, it is not impossible that the results of operations or cash flows of RAI, in particular quarterly or annual periods, could be materially affected by this and by the final outcome of any particular litigation.
However, having regard to the contingent liability disclosures on litigation made by RAI in its public financial reports, the Directors are satisfied with the carrying value included above for RAI.
The Groups share of the RAI results for the year to 31 December 2008 includes 22 million 2007: 18 million in respect of external legal fees and other external product liability defence costs.
Additional information on associates as well as principal subsidiary undertakings is provided in the Principal subsidiary undertakings and Principal associate undertakings sections to the Annual Report.
12 Retirement benefit schemes The Groups subsidiary undertakings operate around 150 retirement benefit arrangements worldwide.
These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
The majority of scheme members belong to defined benefit schemes, most of which are funded externally, although the Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes.
The liabilities arising in the defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
All schemes are formally valued at least every 3 years.
The principal pension schemes are in the UK, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
Together these schemes account for over 86 per cent of the total obligations of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
In addition, the Group operates significant schemes in Canada which provide employees with certain other retirement benefits such as health care.
The liabilities in respect of these benefits are also assessed by qualified independent actuaries, applying the projected unit credit method.
As explained in note 1, the Group has changed the accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses under IAS19 and adopted IFRIC14.
The comparative figures have been restated accordingly for the following changes: Credit charge Credit charge m m Equity as at 1 January 2007 104 Statement of recognised income and expense Differences on exchange 8 Actuarial gains losses 108 amounts previously recognised in income 13 95 Change in surplus recognition 5 amounts previously recognised in income 14 9 Associates actuarial gains losses 17 Tax on items recognised directly in equity 33 amounts previously recognised in income 1 34 Equity as at 31 December 2007 9 Annual Report 2008 British American Tobacco 123 Directors report and accounts Notes on the accounts continued 12 Retirement benefit schemes continued m Balance sheet as at 31 December 2007 Investment in associates and joint ventures note 11 47 Retirement benefits assets 13 Deferred tax assets note 13 2 Total assets 36 Total equity note 20 9 Retirement benefit liabilities 3 Deferred tax liabilities note 13 42 Total equity and liabilities 36 For the year ended 31 December 2007, the profit from operations and taxation were both reduced by 1 million and therefore the profit for the year was unchanged from that previously reported.
The impact of the accounting changes was to reduce the Groups total equity at 31 December 2008 by 817 million and increase the profit for the year by 4 million.
The total accumulated net actuarial losses taken through the Statement of recognised income and expense at 31 December 2008 were 591 million 2007: 44 million for subsidiaries and 357 million loss 2007: 39 million gain for associates and joint ventures.

Contributions to defined benefit schemes are determined after consultation with the respective trustees and actuaries of the individual externally funded schemes, taking into account regulatory requirements.
Contributions in 2009 are expected to be 180 million for pension schemes and 9 million for health care schemes, compared to 145 million and 6 million respectively, in 2008.

com annualreport2008 12 Retirement benefit schemes continued The principal actuarial assumptions weighted to reflect individual scheme differences used in the following principal countries are as follows: UK Germany Canada Netherlands Switzerland %%%%% 31 December 2008 Rate of increase in salaries 4.4 3.0 4.0 3.0 1.6 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.9 2.0 Nil 1.9 Nil Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.9 Nil Nil 1.9 Discount rate 6.0 6.0 5.8 5.9 3.3 General inflation 2.9 2.0 3.0 1.9 1.0 For health care inflation in Canada, the assumption is 10 per cent reducing to 5 per cent by 2018.
For the remaining pension schemes, typical assumptions are that real salary increases will be from 0 per cent to 4 per cent per annum and discount rates will be from 1 per cent to 5 per cent above inflation.
Pension increases, where allowed for, are generally assumed to be in line with inflation.
UK Germany Canada Netherlands Switzerland %%%%% 31 December 2007 Rate of increase in salaries 5.4 3.0 4.0 2.7 1.6 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.4 2.0 Nil 2.4 1.0 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.4 Nil Nil 2.4 Discount rate 5.8 5.5 4.9 5.5 3.3 General inflation 3.4 2.0 3.0 2.4 1.0 For health care inflation in Canada, the assumption is 10 per cent reducing to 5 per cent by 2013.
For the remaining pension schemes, typical assumptions are that real salary increases will be from 2 per cent to 4 per cent per annum and discount rates will be from 2 to 5 per cent above inflation.
Discount rates are determined by reference to normal yields on high-quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date.
For countries where there is not a deep market in such corporate bonds then the yield on government bonds is used.
Mortality assumptions are subject to regular review.
In Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands the same tables were used for both years.
In the UK, for post-retirement mortality assumptions at 31 December 2008 the PXA92 year of birth table rated up 3 years for active and deferred members and PXA92 year of birth table rated up 2 years for current pensioners, with a 1.2 per cent underpin on future improvements, all with the medium cohort effect, have been used.
At 31 December 2007, the PXA92 B 1965 and PXA92 B 1935 tables were used, along with the medium cohort effect, however, active and deferred members were rated up by 1 year and current pensioners were rated up by 3 years.
In Canada UP94 tables, in Germany Heubeck tables 2005G, in Switzerland EVK 2000 mortality tables and in the Netherlands GBM V 2005-2050 tables have been used.
Annual Report 2008 British American Tobacco 127 Directors report and accounts Notes on the accounts continued 12 Retirement benefit schemes continued Based on the above, the weighted average life expectancy, in years, for mortality tables used to determine benefit obligations is as follows: UK Germany Canada Netherlands Switzerland Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female 31 December 2008 Member age 65 current life expectancy 19.4 22.2 18.0 22.2 19.4 22.0 18.0 21.0 17.8 20.6 Member age 45 life expectancy at age 65 23.1 26.5 20.8 24.8 21.0 22.8 19.7 21.8 20.6 23.3 UK Germany Canada Netherlands Switzerland Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female 31 December 2007 Member age 65 current life expectancy 18.9 21.7 17.9 22.0 19.0 21.6 17.7 20.9 17.8 20.6 Member age 45 life expectancy at age 65 22.2 25.0 20.6 24.6 19.0 21.6 19.5 21.7 20.6 23.3 The expected rates of return on scheme assets in the following principal countries are as follows: UK Germany Canada Netherlands Switzerland %%%%% 31 December 2008 Equities 6.9 8.0 8.5 7.4 7.5 Bonds 5.3 5.5 5.5 4.3 3.0 Property 6.9 5.0 6.1 4.9 Other assets 6.9 Nil 4.4 4.0 For the remaining pension schemes, typical expected long-term real rates of return ranged from 1 per cent to 8 per cent.

Expected rates of return are determined taking into account the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments, the historical level of risk premium associated with other invested assets, and the expectations for future returns on such assets.

Valuation of post-retirement schemes involves judgements about uncertain future events.
Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 December 2008 are set out below.
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions such as salary increases.
While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the impacts may offset to some extent.
