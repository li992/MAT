Accounting policies Basis of preparation The parent company financial statements of Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
The balance sheet is presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except where otherwise indicated.
No pro t and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and the Company has taken the exemption under FRS 1 not to present a cash ow statement.
The Company has taken the advantage of the exemption in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and not disclosed information required by that standard, as the Groups consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 Financial Disclosures.
Investments Shares in subsidiary companies and xed asset investments are stated at cost less provisions for any impairment.
Where shares have been issued as part of the consideration for an acquisition these are accounted for at their nominal value in accordance with the exemption under Sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985.
Provision is made against the carrying value of investments where there is impairment in value.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the following exceptions: Provision is made for tax on gains from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of xed assets, or gains on disposal of xed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable pro ts from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Capital reserve own shares Treasury shares held by the EBT are classi ed in capital and reserves, as Capital reserve own shares and recognised at cost.
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase or sale of such shares.
The EBT has waived its entitlement to dividends.
Share-based payment transactions Directors of the Company receive an element of remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments.
The awards vest when certain performance and or service conditions are met, see note 9 for the individual vesting conditions for the various schemes.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings are not recognised by the Company until such options are exercised.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satis ed, provided that all other performance conditions are satis ed.
Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc 95 Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Company financial statements continued At 28 December 2008 1.
Accounting policies continued Share-based payment transactions continued At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired, managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modi ed or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modi cation, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modi ed award, both as measured on the date of the modi cation.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions in respect of equity settled awards and has applied FRS 20 only to awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 3 January 2005.
Provisions for liabilities A provision is recognised when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an out ow of economic bene ts will be required to settle the obligation.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance revenue and finance cost.

The contractual life of each interest is five years and all awards may be equity settled.
The fair value of reversionary interests, which may be equity-settled, is estimated as at the date of granting using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which they were granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the valuations in 2007 and 2008: 2008 2007 Dividend yield % 3.8 3.8 Expected volatility % 20.0 15.0 20.0 Historical volatility % 21.2 18.8 24.1 Risk-free interest rate % 4.3 5.3 5.8 Expected life of reversionary interests years 4.1 4.0 Weighted average initial value pence 212.00 210.00 Weighted average share price pence 217.25 210.00 Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc 99 Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Company financial statements continued At 28 December 2008 9.
Share-based payments continued Long-Term Senior Executive Incentive Plan continued The expected life of the reversionary interests is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility re ects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of the reversionary interests were incorporated into the measurement of fair value, and non-market conditions have not been included in calculating the fair value.
The weighted average fair value of each reversionary interest granted during the year was 34.0p 2007: 32.0p.
