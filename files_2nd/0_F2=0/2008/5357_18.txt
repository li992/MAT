Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2008 42 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 1 Accounting policies Elementis plc is a company incorporated in the UK.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with the UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 75 to 78.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments and financial instruments held for trading or available for sale are stated at their fair value.
Noncurrent assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The preparation of financial statements requires the application of estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and costs and related disclosures at the balance sheet date.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied across group companies to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Critical accounting policies Critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgements or estimates and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions or conditions.
It is considered that the Groups critical accounting policies are limited to those described below.
The development of the estimates and disclosures related to each of these matters has been discussed by the Audit Committee.
a Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
In accordance with the Groups environmental policy and applicable legal requirements, a provision for site restoration in respect of contaminated land is recognised when the land is contaminated.
Provisions for environmental issues are judgemental by their nature and more difficult to estimate when they relate to sites no longer directly controlled by the Group.
Elementis has taken a consistent approach to estimating environmental provisions.
b Pension and other postretirement benefits In respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes, the Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
Pension and postretirement liabilities are calculated by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The expected increase in the present value of scheme liabilities and the long term expected return on assets based on the fair value of the scheme assets at the start of the period, are included in the income statement under finance income.
Any difference between the expected return on assets and that achieved is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense together with the difference from experience or assumption changes.
The Group recognises all such actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur through the statement of recognised income and expense.
The Group also operates a small number of defined contribution schemes and the contributions payable during the year are recognised as incurred.
Due to the size of the pension scheme assets and liabilities, relatively small changes in the assumptions can have a significant impact on the expense recorded in the income statement and on the pension liability recorded in the balance sheet.
c Int angible assets i Goodwill All business combinations since the transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since the transition date, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the consideration given and the fair value of net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.
Goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units and tested annually for impairment.
Changes to the assumptions used in impairment testing could have a material impact on the financial position of the Group and of the result for the year.
ii Research and development Expenditure on research is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development where research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
Expenditure capitalised is stated as the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads less accumulated amortisation.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost or when arising in a business combination, estimated fair value, less accumulated amortisation.
F FI In nA An nCIA CIAl St l StA Atement tementS S Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2008 43 iv Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
On this basis there is no amortisation of intangible assets relating to brand.
Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Patents and trademarks 10 20 years Other intangible assets 1 5 years d Deriv ative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Due to the requirement to measure the effectiveness of hedging instruments, changes in market conditions can result in the recognition of unrealised gains or losses on hedging instruments in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in a fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged even if it is normally carried at cost or amortised cost and any gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised immediately in the income statement even if those gains would normally be recognised directly in reserves.
e Ex ceptional items The Group presents certain items separately as exceptional.
These are items, which in managements judgement, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size and incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information.
The determination of which items are separately disclosed as exceptional items requires a significant degree of judgement.
f Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The Group is required to estimate the income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This requires an estimation of current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments.
The Group operates in a number of countries in the world and is subject to many tax jurisdictions and rules.
As a consequence the Group is subject to tax audits, which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude.
Managements judgement is required to determine the total provision for income tax.
Amounts are accrued based on managements interpretation of country specific tax law and likelihood of settlement.
However the actual tax liabilities could differ from the position and in such events an adjustment would be required in the subsequent period which could have a material impact.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable.
Once considered to be probable, management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on the basis of potential settlement through negotiation.
This evaluation requires judgements to be made including the forecast of future taxable income.
Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2008 44 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 Critical accounting policies continued g Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Leasehold property is depreciated over the period of the lease.
Freehold buildings, plant and machinery, vehicles, fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are assessed at the reporting date.
No depreciation is charged on assets under construction until the asset is brought into use.
Estimates of useful lives of these assets are: Buildings 10 50 years Plant and machinery 2 20 years Vehicles 2 10 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 20 years The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within it will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.
The costs of the daytoday servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Management regularly considers whether there are any indications of impairment to carrying values of property, plant and equipment.
Impairment reviews are based on risk adjusted discounted cash flow projections.
Significant judgement is applied to the assumptions underlying these projections which include estimated discount rates, growth rates, future selling prices and direct costs.
Changes to these assumptions could have a material impact on the financial position of the Group and on the result for the year.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the period.
A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during a period are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
In accordance with the transitional rules of IFRS 1, the Company has not restated business combinations that took place prior to the date of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2004.
As a consequence the Scheme of Arrangement entered into in 1998 whereby the Company acquired Elementis Holdings Limited and applied the true and fair override to account for the transaction as a merger has not been restated under IFRS.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the postacquisition total recognised gains and losses and the net assets of associates on an equity accounted basis.
Where the Groups share of losses exceeds its investment in an associate, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred a legal or constructive obligation.
Foreign currency a Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
b Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation are translated at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at the average rates of exchange ruling for the relevant period.
As allowed by IAS 21, exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations and of related hedges are taken to the translation reserve.
They are recognised in the income statement upon disposal of the foreign operation.
The Group hedges a portion of the translation exposure of its overseas net assets through US Dollar and Euro borrowings.
From 1 January 2005, the Group has elected to apply net investment hedge accounting for these transactions where possible.
Where hedging is applied, the effective portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment is recognised in equity.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the income statement.
F FI In nA An nCIA CIAl St l StA Atement tementS S Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2008 45 leased assets Leases which result in the Group receiving substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as finance leases.
An asset held under a finance lease is recorded in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term.
Future instalments net of finance charges are included within borrowings.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge, which is allocated to each period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining liability and charged to the income statement and reduction of the outstanding liability.
Rental costs arising from operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price, less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Cost, which is based on a weighted average, includes expenditure incurred in acquiring stock and bringing it to its existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads attributable to manufacture, based on normal operating capacity.
trade receivables Trade receivables are non interest bearing and are stated at their nominal amount which is the original invoiced amount less provision made for bad and doubtful receivables.
Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of receivables and historical experience.
Individual trade receivables are written off when management deem them no longer to be collectable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially measured at cost which is equal to the fair value at inception, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the terms of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
trade payables Trade payables are non interest bearing borrowings and are initially measured at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity.
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
Impairment The carrying amount of noncurrent assets other than deferred tax is compared to the assets recoverable amount at each balance sheet date where there is an indication of impairment.
For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cashgenerating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cashgenerating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cashgenerating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
The recoverable amount is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
revenue Revenue is based on the fair value of consideration received from the sale of goods and services.
It excludes sales between Group undertakings, VAT and similar sales based taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
Investment income and finance costs Investment income comprises interest income on funds invested and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value taken to the income statement.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, dividends on preference shares classified as liabilities, foreign currency losses and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value taken to the income statement.
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2008 46 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 1 Accounting policies continued Share based payments The fair value of equity settled share options granted to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an employee expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
own shares held by employee Share ownership trust eSot Transactions of the Groupsponsored ESOT are included in the consolidated financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
Investments Investments comprising loans and receivables are stated at amortised cost.
Government grants Grants against capital expenditure from government and other bodies are shown as creditors in the balance sheet.
Such grants are released to the profit and loss account over the same period for which the relevant assets are depreciated.
noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations A noncurrent asset or a group of assets containing a noncurrent asset a disposal group, is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale, noncurrent assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to profit or loss.
The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale that has been disposed of or has been abandoned, or that meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
termination benefits Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to terminate employment before the normal retirement date.
Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised if the Group has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.
new standards and interpretations not yet adopted New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2008, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements, but that become mandatory for the Groups 2009 financial statements are as follows: IFRS 8 Operating segments This requires segment disclosure based on the components of an entity that management monitors in making operating decisions, rather than disclosure of business and geographical segments.
It is not anticipated that the introduction of this standard will materially impact the Groups current disclosure since the segments used for operational review are the same as those currently disclosed for the business segments.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit of a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction This sets out the extent to which a pension scheme surplus can be recognised as an asset of the Company and also considers how a pension balance sheet asset or liability could be affected by statutory or contractual minimum funding requirements.
Management does not believe that the adoption of this standard will impact the Group.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements A revised presentation Amendments to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs The Group has not yet determined the potential impact of these interpretations on the 2009 financial statements.

These are items which, in managements judgement, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information.
The 20.5 million impairment charge relates to a reassessment of the value in use of property, plant and equipment in the UK Chromium business following a review of its prospects.
In calculating the value in use, a pretax discount rate of 9.2 per cent was used.
In previous years the UK Chromium business had been considered to be part of the same cash generating unit as the US Chromium business.
However, changing economic conditions have resulted in the UK business becoming far more exposed to foreign competition in its markets than is the case for the US business, where the logistical benefits of being a domestic producer are more significant.
The UK business is a relatively high cost producer compared to others in its key markets and together with the continued evolution of Chinese exports indicates that the business will become unprofitable for the foreseeable future, thus prompting the need for an impairment review of the assets used in production.
Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2008 50 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 6 Income tax expense Continuing operations Discontinued operations Total 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 million million million million million million Current tax: Overseas corporation tax 2.8 0.9 1.3 2.8 2.2 Adjustments in respect of prior years: United Kingdom 0.2 0.2 Overseas 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 Total current tax 1.6 0.1 1.3 1.6 1.2 Deferred tax: Overseas 5.9 2.6 5.1 5.9 7.7 Adjustments in respect of prior years 0.7 0.7 Total deferred tax 6.6 2.6 5.1 6.6 7.7 Income tax expense for the year 8.2 2.5 6.4 8.2 8.9 Comprising: Before exceptional items 8.2 1.8 0.2 8.2 2.0 Exceptional items 0.7 6.2 6.9 8.2 2.5 6.4 8.2 8.9 The tax charge on profit before exceptional items from continuing operations represents an effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 16.9 per cent 2007: 5.3 per cent.
The rate is lower than the standard UK corporation tax due to the amortisation of goodwill in the US for tax purposes and the utilisation of UK tax losses.

The carrying value of goodwill relates to Elementis Specialty Products and Elementis Surfactants.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pretax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The discount rate used in 2008 was 9.2 per cent 2007: 7.7 per cent.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent three year plans approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following seventeen years based on an estimated growth rate of 2.5 per cent.
The rate does not exceed the average longterm growth rate for the relevant markets.
Other intangible assets comprise mainly of value ascribed to the brand and customer lists acquired as part of the Deuchem acquisition.
The customer list is being amortised over a useful economic life of 10 years.
In 2008 the Group wrote down the carrying value of the fixed assets at the Eaglescliffe Chromium plant following an evaluation of likely future profitability after changes in market dynamics.

The self insurance provisions are expected to be utilised within five years.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Where this is not the case, deferred tax assets have not been recognised.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
There are no significant temporary differences arising in connection with interests in subsidiaries and associates.

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed reguarly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Groups Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
No single customer accounts for a significant proportion of the Groups revenue and geographically there is no concentration of credit risk.
Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Groups standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered.
The Groups review includes external ratings, where available, and in some cases bank references.
Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represents the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board.
Customers that fail to meet the Groups benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar assets.
Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a credit rating of at least A1 from Standard & Poors and A from Moodys.
Given these high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups funding policy is to have committed borrowings in place to cover at least 125 per cent of the maximum forecast net borrowings for the next 12 month period.
At the year end the Group had 70.4 million 2007: 125.4 million of undrawn committed facilities, which expire after more than one year but within 3 years.
market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the Euro and the US Dollar.
The Group hedges approximately 70 per cent of current and forecast trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
F FI In nA An nCIA CIAl St l StA Atement tementS S Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2008 59 Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily US Dollar, but also Euro and GBP.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address shortterm imbalances.
The Groups investment in overseas subsidiaries is hedged by US Dollar denominated drawdowns under the syndicated facility, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the translation of subsidiarys net assets.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to borrow at both fixed and floating interest rates and to use interest rate swaps to generate the required interest profile.
The policy does not require that a specific proportion of the Groups borrowings are at fixed rates of interest.
other market price risk Equity price risk arises from availableforsale equity securities held within the Groups defined benefit pension obligations.
Management monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market expectations.
The primary goal of the Groups investment strategy is to maximise investment returns in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded benefit obligations: management is assisted by external advisors in this regard.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Groups expected usage and sale requirements: such contracts are not settled net.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders equity, excluding minority interests, and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the Groups savings related share option schemes.
At present, employees hold 0.3 per cent of ordinary shares, or 3.0 per cent assuming that all outstanding options vest or are exercised.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Groups target is to achieve a return on shareholders equity of between 10 and 15 per cent: in 2008 the return was 11.2 per cent 2007: 26.6 per cent.
In comparison the weighted average interest expense on interestbearing borrowings excluding liabilities with imputed interest was 3.5 per cent 2007: 6.2 per cent.

Derivatives The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a riskfree interest based on government bonds.
Nonderivatives financial liabilities Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on the government yield curve at the reporting date plus an adequate constant credit spread, and were as follows: 2008 2007 per cent per cent Derivatives 3.7 4.4 Borrowings 2.07.2 5.8 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2008 64 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 23 Operating leases 2008 2007 million million Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised as an expense in the year 2.1 1.7 At the balance sheet date, the Group has outstanding commitments under noncancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2008 2007 million million Within one year 0.6 0.5 In the second to fifth years inclusive 3.5 3.6 After five years 0.3 0.1 4.4 4.2 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its properties, plant and machinery.
Leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
24 Retirement benefit obligations The Group has a number of contributory and noncontributory post retirement benefit plans providing retirement benefits for the majority of employees and executive directors.
The main schemes in the UK, US and the Netherlands are of the defined benefit type, the benefit being based on number of years of service and either the employees final remuneration or the employees average remuneration during a period of years before retirement.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the Group balance sheet.
In addition the Group operates an unfunded postretirement medical benefit PRMB scheme in the US.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period.
There was a charge in respect of postretirement health care and pensions in the year of 2.1 million 2007: 2.1 million credit, of which 0.8 million 2007: 0.8 million credit related to overseas schemes.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out on 30 September 2005 for the UK scheme and at 31 December 2008 for the US and Netherlands schemes.
The UK actuarial valuation has been updated to 31 December 2008 for inclusion within this Annual Report.
The trustees of the UK scheme are required to act in the best interest of the funds beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees to the UK scheme is determined by the trust schemes documentation.
The Group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by the UK scheme members.
Investigations have been carried out during the past three years into the mortality experience of the Groups major schemes.
The investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for improvements in mortality rates.
The assumed life expectancies on retirement are: UK US Netherlands 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 years years years years years years Retiring at 31 December 2008 Males 20 20 19 19 19 19 Females 22 23 21 21 21 21 Retiring in 20 years Males 22 21 21 21 19 19 Females 24 24 22 22 21 21 F FI In nA An nCIA CIAl St l StA Atement tementS S Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2008 65 The principal assumptions used by the actuaries were as follows: UK US Netherlands per cent per cent per cent 2008 Rate of increase in salaries 3.80 3.45 2.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.80 0.25 Discount rate 6.40 6.25 5.75 Inflation 2.80 3.25 2.00 2007 Rate of increase in salaries 4.20 3.70 2.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.10 0.50 Discount rate 6.00 6.25 5.75 Inflation 3.20 3.50 2.00 2006 Rate of increase in salaries 4.00 3.70 1.50 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.90 0.25 Discount rate 5.30 5.75 4.75 Inflation 3.00 3.50 1.50 The main assumptions for the PRMB scheme are a discount rate of 6.25 per cent 2007: 6.25 per cent per annum and a health care cost trend of 10.0 per cent 2007: 10.0 per cent and 11.0 per cent 2007: 11.0 per cent per annum for claims pre age 65 and post age 65 respectively reducing to 4.5 per cent per annum by 2014 2007: 4.5 per cent.
Actuarial valuations of retirement benefit plans in other jurisdictions have not been updated for IAS19 purposes because of the costs involved and the considerably smaller scheme sizes and numbers of employees involved.

The 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme is a discretionary scheme under which senior management below Board level are granted options to purchase shares in the Company.
The option price is the average market price over the five working days preceding the grant and there is no discount.
Options are capable of exercise after three years and within ten years of the date of the grant: those granted since 1995 are subject to earnings per share performance targets.
The 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme is a discretionary scheme under which executive directors and senior managers below Board level are granted options to purchase shares in the Company.
The option price is the market price of a share on the dealing day immediately preceding the day on which the option is granted with no discount applied.
Options are capable of exercise after three years, subject to earnings per share and total shareholder return performance targets being met, and within ten years of the date of the grant.
The 1998 and 2008 UK SavingsRelated Share Option Schemes are schemes under which UK employees can enter into savings contracts with a building society or a bank for a period of three or five years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The option price is the average market price over the five working days preceding the invitation date discounted by a maximum of 20 per cent.
The 1998 scheme expired last year, although options are still outstanding under that scheme, and was replaced by the 2008 scheme.
The 2000 and 2008 US SavingsRelated Share Option Schemes are schemes under which US employees can enter into savings contracts with a bank for a period of two years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The option price is the market price on the date of the grant, discounted by 15 per cent.
The 2000 scheme expired last year, although options are still outstanding under that scheme, and was replaced by the 2008 scheme.
Options were valued using the binomial option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: 2008 2007 Fair value per option pence 23.9 29.0 Weighted average share price at grant pence 59.1 58.0 Weighted average exercise price pence 57.5 56.6 Expected volatility per cent 35.0 38.0 Risk free rate per cent 4.5 5.4 Expected dividend yield per cent 3.6 2.7 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous five years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of 0.8 million 2007: 0.9 million related to equitysettled share based payment transactions during the year.
The table overleaf shows all outstanding options granted under the executive and savings related share option schemes.
The Company also adopted a long term incentive plan LTIP in 2008 and awards were made to four senior executives.
Details of these awards are set out on page 32 of the Directors remuneration report.
The LTIP awards were valued using the binomial method and an IFRS 2 expense of 0.3 million was recognised last year, which is included in the total expenses recognised in 2008 disclosed above.

Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2008 72 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 30 Acquisitions On 1 July 2008 the Group acquired all the shares of Deuchem Co. Ltd, a Taiwan based company, for a cash consideration of 38.5 million.
Deuchem is a leading supplier of additives and resins to the coating and related industries, with manufacturing and technical facilities in Taiwan and China.
On 8 July 2008 the Group set up a new business with Anji County Yu Hong Clay Chemicals Co. Ltd for the production of organoclays in China.
The Group holds 80 per cent of the shares in this new business entity, which is treated as a subsidiary.
Cash consideration paid was 2.6 million.
The acquisitions had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities: Book value Fair value Fair Value of acquisition adjustments assets acquired million million million Intangible assets 0.4 13.1 13.5 Property, plant and equipment 12.6 2.2 14.8 Inventories 6.5 6.5 Trade and other receivables 11.3 11.3 Trade and other payables 5.1 5.1 Cash and cash equivalents 10.1 10.1 Loans and borrowings 14.1 14.1 Corporation tax 0.4 0.4 Deferred tax 1.2 3.8 5.0 20.1 11.5 31.6 Goodwill 10.6 Consideration paid, satisfied in cash 42.2 Cash acquired 10.1 Net cash outflow 32.1 The consideration for the acquisitions, which included professional fees and incidental expenses of 1.1 million, has been allocated against identified net assets with the remaining balance recorded as goodwill.
The goodwill recognised on acquisition reflects both the capabilities of the acquired entities personnel and the synergistic opportunities going forward, neither of which can be allocated to an identifiable intangible asset.
Acquisitions made during 2008 contributed 20.2 million to the Groups revenue, 0.5 million to the operating profit before intangible amortisation and 0.1 million to the operating profit after amortisation.

As far as the directors are aware, the Company and its affiliates no longer manufacture products for use as heat stabiliser products that are the subject of the Commissions investigation and have not done so since 1998, when the Company disposed of its 50 per cent joint venture interest in Akcros Chemicals to Akzo Nobel, the other 50 per cent shareholder in the joint venture.
Elementis is cooperating fully with the Commissions investigation.
It is possible that the Company may incur liabilities and related costs as a result of the investigation, the extent of which, if any, cannot be quantified now.
Under the EU Commissions fining guidelines, a fine could amount up to 30 per cent of the turnover generated with the products concerned multiplied by the number of years during which a cartel was deemed to exist with an absolute upper limit of 10 per cent of groupwide turnover.
FInAnCIAl StAtementS Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2008 75 Parent company balance sheet The Group is required to present a separate balance sheet for the holding company, Elementis plc, which continues to adopt UK generally accepted accounting principles.
Its accounting policies are set out in note 33 and its balance sheet is set out below.
Elementis plc Balance Sheet at 31 December 2008 2008 2007 Note million million Fixed assets Investments 35 590.1 590.1 Current assets Debtors 36 0.7 0.7 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Creditors 37 0.3 Net current assets 0.4 Total assets less current liabilities 590.8 590.5 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year Amounts due to subsidiary undertakings 244.3 229.3 Net assets 346.5 361.2 Capital and reserves Called up share capital 39 22.4 22.3 Share premium account 40 5.8 5.2 Capital redemption reserve 40 83.3 83.3 Other reserves 40 81.5 81.5 Share option reserve 40 1.6 1.2 Profit and loss account 40 151.9 167.7 Equity shareholders funds 346.5 361.2 The financial statements of Elementis plc on pages 75 to 78 were approved by the Board on 24 February 2009 and signed on its behalf by: David Dutro Brian Taylorson Group Chief executive Finance Director Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2008 76 Notes to the financial statements of Elementis plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 33 Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements, except as noted below.
Basis of preparation The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost accounting rules.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its profit and loss account.
As the Companys voting rights are controlled within the Group headed by Elementis plc, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 and has therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with entities which form part of the Group or investees of the Group qualifying as related parties.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Investments Investments in Group undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost, or if lower, directors valuation.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
pensions and other postretirement benefits The Company participates in the Elementis Group defined benefit pension scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and as required by FRS 17, it has treated the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable for the year.
taxation Deferred taxation is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Advance corporation tax recoverable by deduction from future corporation tax is carried forward within deferred taxation or as ACT recoverable within debtors as appropriate.
Share based payments The fair value of share options granted to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company Following the adoption of FRS 25, financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company: and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a nonderivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Companys exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that the definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of interest payable and similar charges.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified as part of shareholders funds, are dealt with as appropriations in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds.
