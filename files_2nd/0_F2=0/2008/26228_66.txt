com Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 115 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 33 Insurance contract liabilities continued Insurance contract undiscounted cash flows are based on the expected date of settlement.
Amounts under unit linked contracts are generally repayable on demand and the Group is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient liquidity within the asset portfolio to enable liabilities to unit linked policyholders to be met as they fall due.
However, the terms of funds investing in less liquid assets permit the deferral of redemptions for predefined periods in circumstances where there are not sufficient liquid assets within the fund to meet the level of requested redemptions.
Accordingly unit linked liabilities have been excluded from the table.

I n 2007, the Effect of change in non-economic assumptions includes approximately 214m relating to the strengthening of assumptions for annuitant longevity on existing business.
This was largely offset by mortality and changes to expense assumptions on term business on a gross of reassurance basis, which reflected improved experience.
In 2008, the Effect of changes in economic assumptions includes the impact arising from the current interest rate environment and increased credit spreads reducing liabilities, partially offset by the 650m of additional reserves for non profit annuity credit default, bringing the total reserve to 1.2bn.
