annual report and accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 continued 24 Provisions continued Employees within XTB receive long service payment awards for 10 years or more of service.
As the amount and timing of utilisation of this provision is based on estimates of the number of employees likely to stay with the Group in excess of 10 years, which is outside the Groups control, there is an element of uncertainty surrounding this provision.
The other provisions include other personnel related provisions, being provisions for profit sharing, retention bonuses, gratuities and leave encashment, provisions for archiving required under banking regulations, technology and communications, consultancy, and, in the prior year, a tax reimbursement due to one of the minority shareholders and VAT provisions due to changes in regulations.
The majority of these other provisions are expected to be utilised within a year other than the provision for archiving, which relates to a requirement under German banking regulations, whereby records must be archived for a minimum of 10 years.
