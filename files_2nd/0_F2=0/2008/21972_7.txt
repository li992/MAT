The 2007 financial statements were not impacted as the changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

This comprises a credit of 123 million which has been recognised in the income statement and a charge of 8 million which has been recognised in reserves.
The decrease in deferred tax is due to the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.

The results of the company are included in the consolidated financial statements of BT Group plc.

At 31 March 2008, other than disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the company business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The company has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the company generally carries its own risks.
The company has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O2 UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on 19 November 2001.
O2 plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum likely exposure is US$72 million 36 million as at 31 March 2008, although this could increase by a further US$402 million 201 million in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until O2 UK Ltd has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company.
There have been criminal proceedings in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian UMTS universal mobile telecommunication system auction in 2000.
Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
On 20 July 2005, the former BT employee was found not culpable of the fraud charge brought by the Rome Public Prosecutor.
All the other defendants were also acquitted.
The Public Prosecutor is in the process of appealing the courts decision.
If the appeal is successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for any damages.
The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential claim.
The European Commission formally investigated the way the UK government set BTs property rates and those paid by Kingston Communications, and whether or not the Government complied with European Community Treaty rules on state aid.
It concluded that no state aid had been granted.
The Commissions decision has now been appealed, but we continue to believe that any allegation of state aid is groundless, and that the appeal will not succeed.

Retirement benets Background The company offers retirement benefit schemes to its employees.
The companys main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.

The total pension costs of the company, included within the staff costs, in the year was 600 million 2007: 613 million.
The total cost relating to the BTPS was 561 million 2007: 593 million, of which 557 million 2007: 585 million was borne by the company.
An element of the total charge relating to the BTPS is recharged to fellow subsidiary undertakings who are participating employers in the pension scheme.
The company retains the full liability of the BTPS.
Dened contribution schemes The profit and loss charge in respect of dened contribution schemes represents the contribution payable by the company based on a xed percentage of employees pay.
The pension cost for the year in respect of the companys main dened contribution scheme was 37 million 2007: 28 million and 3 million 2007: 3 million of contributions were outstanding at 31 March 2008.
Dened benefit schemes BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited administers and manages the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the trust deed of the BTPS, there are nine trustee directors appointed by the group, five of which appointments are made with the agreement of the relevant trade unions, including the chairman of the trustee directors.
Four trustee directors, other than the Chairman, are appointed by BT on the nomination of the relevant trade unions.
Two of the trustee directors will normally hold senior positions with the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualied candidate, there should be at least one current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS as one of the trustee directors.
Trustee directors are appointed for a three year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment.
The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, xed interest and index linked securities, deposits and short-term investments.
At 31 March 2008, the UK equities included 10 million 2007: 14 million ordinary shares of the ultimate parent company, BT Group plc, with a market value of 22 million 2007: 43 million.
