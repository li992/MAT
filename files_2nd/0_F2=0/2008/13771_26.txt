108 Notes to the accounts Company For the year ended 30 September 2008 Parent Company accounting policies a Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of share-based payments which are measured at fair value at the date of grant and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the more important Company accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, is set out below.
b Foreign currency translation Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the year-end.
Differences arising on the re-translation of the net investments and the results for the year are taken directly to reserves together with differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against equity investments in foreign enterprises.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
c Deferred tax Deferred tax is accounted for under FRS 19, Deferred Tax, which requires a form of full provision for accounting for deferred tax, called the incremental liability approach.
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences where the Company has an obligation to pay more tax in the future as a result of those timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
As permitted by FRS 19, the Company has adopted a policy of not discounting deferred tax assets and liabilities.
d Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for any diminution in value.
e Parent Company profit and loss account and cash flow statement The amount of loss for the financial year before dividends within the accounts of the parent Company is 79.5m 2007: 52.4m.
There is no material difference between the profits and losses as reported above and historical cost profits and losses and there are no other gains or losses in the year.
No profit and loss account or cash flow statement is presented for the Company as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. f Share-based payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest allowing for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes or the Monte Carlo pricing models.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Company also provides certain employees with the ability to purchase the Companys ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value at the date of the grant.
The Company records an expense, based on its estimate of the discount related to shares expected to vest, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
At each Balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates for the number of options expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
