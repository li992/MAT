NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 March 2008 1.
Segmental analysis Primary reporting format business segments The groups principal activities include: the provision of networked IT services: local, national and international telecommunications services: broadband and internet products and services: and converged xed mobile products and services.
The group is organised into four customer facing lines of business, BT Global Services, BT Retail, BT Wholesale and Openreach, which are supported by two internal functional units, BT Operate and BT Design.
The activities of each of the customer facing lines of business are as follows: BT Global Services serves major corporate and carrier organisations across the world providing high-performance managed networked IT services, application management, professional services and outsourcing solutions.
BT Retail serves consumer customers and small and medium sized enterprises SMEs in the UK, providing a range of innovative communications products and services.
BT Retail also includes BT Ireland, which operates across the major corporate, SME, consumer and wholesale markets throughout the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Enterprises, which comprises a number of individual businesses such as BT Conferencing, BT Directories and BT Payphones.
BT Wholesale provides services to UK communications providers through a diverse portfolio ranging from nationally available broadband, voice and data connectivity services and interconnect to bespoke, fully managed network outsourcing and value added solutions.
Openreach is responsible for the crucial first mile connecting communications provider customers to their local telephone exchange, giving them open and economic access to the UK network.
Openreach products are sold on an equivalent basis to BT lines of business and other communications providers at the same arms length prices, with the BT lines of business being treated no differently than any other customer with regard to terms and conditions or acccess to systems and data.
Business transformation With effect from 1 October 2007, the group changed the presentation of its financial results to reect the reorganisation of the business that has taken place in 2008.
The segment results for 2007 and 2006 have therefore been restated to provide a consistent presentation for all years.
The reorganisation has not impacted overall group results.
The new organisational structure is based around two new internal functional units, namely BT Design and BT Operate.
BT Design and BT Operate support the existing four customer facing lines of business.
BT Design is responsible for the development and deployment of the platforms, systems and processes which support our services and BT Operate is responsible for their operation.
Neither BT Design nor BT Operate are reportable segments, and the reportable segments continue to be the customer facing lines of business.
Neither BT Design nor BT Operate generate any revenue and both operate on a cost recovery basis.
The costs incurred by BT Design and BT Operate are allocated to the customer facing lines of business in line with the services they provide.
The depreciation and amortisation incurred by BT Operate in relation to the networks and systems they manage and operate on behalf of the customer facing lines of business are allocated to the lines of business based on their expected utilisation.
The assets managed by BT Operate and their capital expenditure in the year are also allocated to the lines of business in a manner consistent with the depreciation and amortisation.
Accordingly, the segmental results do not necessarily reect the operating results of the lines of business as if they were independent business operations.
The historical results of the lines of business have changed, however, reecting changes to the structure of intra-group trading arrangements and the allocation of costs between the lines of business.
The main change to the intra-group trading arrangements is that a significant amount of intra-group trading has been eliminated.
The exception to this is Openreach as trading between Openreach and the other customer facing lines of business has not been impacted by the groups reorganisation.
Intra-group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on the market price.
Intra-group revenue generated from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant lines of business.
In addition to the four customer facing lines of business, the remaining operations of the group are aggregated and included within the other category to reconcile to the consolidated results of the group.
Included within other is any over or under recovery of costs by BT Design and BT Operate, as well as the other group functions and operations.

Specic items The group separately identies and discloses significant one off or unusual items termed specic items.
This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and we believe assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group.
A denition of specic items is provided in the accounting policies section on page 29.

Intangible assets continued Impairments test of goodwill The group performs an annual goodwill impairment test, based on cash generating units CGUs.
BT Global Services is a CGU.
BT Retail comprises four CGUs: Consumer, Business, Enterprises and BT Ireland.
These are the smallest identiable groups of assets that generate cash inows that have goodwill and are largely independent of the cash inows from other groups of assets.
The group has made a number of acquisitions in recent years, all of which have been fully integrated into the relevant line of business and CGU.
The groups reorganisation has not impacted the groups CGUs or the allocation of goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups CGUs as follows: BT Retail BT Global Services Consumer Business Enterprises BT Ireland Total m m m m m m At 1 April 2006 488 39 16 543 Acquisition through business combinations 223 57 16 296 Exchange differences 20 20 At 1 April 2007 691 57 55 16 819 Acquisition through business combinations 250 13 34 297 Disposals and adjustments 39 23 62 Exchange differences 11 11 At 31 March 2008 913 47 34 55 16 1,065 The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
These are determined using cash ow projections derived from financial budgets approved by the board covering a five year period.
They reect managements expectation of revenue growth, operating costs and margin for each CGU based on past experience.
Cash ows beyond the five year period have been extrapolated using an estimated terminal growth rate of 0%.
This rate has been determined with regard to projected growth rates for the specic markets in which the CGUs participate and is not considered to exceed the long-term average growth rates for those markets.
Discount rates applied to the cash ow forecasts are derived from the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the different risk prole of the individual CGUs.
The discount rates applied were 10% and 11.4%.
The forecasts are most sensitive to changes in projected revenue growth rates in the first five years of the forecast period.
However there is significant headroom and based on the sensitivity analysis performed we have concluded that no reasonably possible changes in the base case assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.

At 31 March 2008, 2,513 million 2007: 1,683 million of the deferred tax liability of 2,513 million 2007: 1,683 million is expected to be settled after more than twelve months.
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2007 Budget statement which have been enacted in the 2007 and 2008 Finance Acts.
The 2007 financial statements were not impacted as the changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The effect of the change has been to reduce the value of the deferred tax liability recognised at 1 April 2007 by 104 million.
This comprises a credit of 154 million which has been recognised in the income statement as a specic item and a charge of 50 million which has been recognised in equity.
The decrease in deferred tax is due to the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
At 31 March 2008 the group had operating losses, capital losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 23.3 billion 2007: 21.1 billion.
The groups capital losses and other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arise.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: 2008 Territory m Expiry of losses Restricted losses: Americas 310 2013 2028 Europe 1,788 2008 2023 Total restricted losses 2,098 Unrestricted losses: Operating losses 2,747 No expiry Capital losses 17,562 No expiry Other 940 No expiry Total unrestricted losses 21,249 Total 23,347 At the balance sheet date, the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was 10.6 billion 2007: 9.3 billion.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of those unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised are insignicant.

It is the Operating Committee which has responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the group.

The net value of services purchased was 305 million 2007: 178 million, 2006: 105 million and the amount outstanding and payable for services at 31 March 2008 was 125 million 2007: 97 million, 2006: 59 million.
In addition, a cash payment of 55 million was received during 2008, representing income of 28 million and a prepayment of 27 million.

Leases have an average term of 24 years 2007: 25 years and rentals are xed for an average of 24 years 2007: 25 years.
At 31 March 2008, other than disclosed below there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O2 UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on 19 November 2001.
O2 plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum exposure is US$72 million 2007: US$82 million, approximately 36 million 2007: 39 million as at 31 March 2008, although this could increase by a further US$402 million 2007: US$404 million, approximately 202 million 2007: 205 million in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until O2 UK Ltd has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the group.
There have been criminal proceedings in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian UMTS Universal mobile telecommunications system auction in 2000.
Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
On 20 July 2005, the former BT employee was found not culpable of the fraud charge brought by the Rome Public Prosecutor.
All the other defendants were also acquitted.
The Public Prosecutor is in the process of appealing the courts decision.
If the appeal is successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for any damages.
The company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such claim.
The European Commission formally investigated the way the UK government set BTs property rates and those paid by Kingston Communications, and whether or not the Government complied with European Community Treaty roles on state aid.
It concluded that no state aid had been granted.
The Commissions decision has now been appealed but we continue to believe that any allegation of state aid is groundless and that the appeal will not succeed.

Retirement benefit plans Background The group offers retirement benefit schemes to its employees.
The groups main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a dened contribution scheme, the BT Retirement Plan BTRP.
The total pension cost of the group for the year included within staff costs was 626 million 2007: 643 million, 2006: 603 million.
Dened contribution schemes The income statement charge in respect of dened contribution schemes represents the contribution payable by the group based on a xed percentage of employees pay.
The total pension cost for the year in respect of the groups main dened contribution scheme was 37 million 2007: 28 million, 2006: 19 million and 3 million 2007: 3 million, 2006: 2 million of contributions were outstanding at 31 March 2008.
Dened benefit schemes BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited administers and manages the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the trust deed of the BTPS, there are nine trustee directors appointed by the group, five of which appointments are made with the agreement of the relevant trade unions including the Chairman of the Trustees.
Four trustee directors, other than the Chairman, are appointed by BT on the nomination of the relevant trade unions.
Two of the trustee directors will normally hold senior positions within the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualied candidate, there should be at least one current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS as one of the trustee directors.
Trustee directors are appointed for a three year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment.
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities IAS 19 Scheme assets are measured at the bid market value at the balance sheet date.
The liabilities of the BTPS are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash ows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cash ows are discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of an equivalent term to the liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The financial assumptions used to measure the net pension obligation of the BTPS at 31 March 2008 are as follows: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 % %% % % Rate used to discount liabilities 3.24 2.28 2.19 6.85 5.35 5.00 a a a a a a Average future increases in wages and salaries 0.75 0.75 0.75 4.28 3.77 3.52 Average increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.50 3.00 2.75 Ination average increase in retail price index 3.50 3.00 2.75 a There is a short-term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.5% for the first three years.

At 31 March 2008, the UK equities included 10 million 2007: 14 million ordinary shares of BT Group plc with a market value of 22 million 2007: 43 million.
The group occupies two properties owned by the BTPS scheme on which an annual rental of 0.1 million is payable 2007: 0.1 million.

The expected returns on xed interest and interest linked securities are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year.
Expected returns on equities, property and alternative asset classes are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above yields on government bonds, consensus economic forecasts of future returns and historical returns.
Alternative asset classes include commodities and hedge funds.
During the year the short-term fide-risking activities have hedged the downside risks associated with the schemes equity exposure and reduced the short-term economic exposure to equities to 39%.
The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net finance income.

No deficiency contributions are due in 2009.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure the BTPS scheme liabilities The assumed discount rate, mortality rates and salary increases all have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions.

Retirement benefit plans continued Funding valuation and future funding obligations A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The funding valuation is performed at 31 December as this is the financial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows: scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value.
The last three triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2005 2002 1999 2005 2002 1999 valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation %%%%%% Discount rate Pre retirement liabilities 3.06 5.84 Post retirement liabilities 1.79 4.54 Return on existing assets, relative to market values 4.52 2.38 7.13 5.45 after allowing for an annual increase in dividends of 1.00 1.00 3.53 4.03 Return on future investments 4.00 4.00 6.60 7.12 Average increase in retail price index 2.70 2.50 3.00 a a Average future increases in wages and salaries 0.75 1.5 1.75 3.47 4.04 4.80 Average increase in pensions 2.70 2.50 3.00 a There is a shortterm reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 1.25% for the first three years.
At 31 December 2005, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of 34.4 billion 2002: 22.8 billion and were sufficient to cover 90.9% 2002: 91.6% of the benets accrued by that date.
This represented a funding deficit of 3.4 billion compared with 2.1 billion at 31 December 2002.
The funding valuation uses conservative assumptions whereas, had the valuation been based on the actuarys view of the median estimate basis the scheme would have been in surplus.
The market value of equity investments had increased and the investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the benets paid.
In the three years ended 31 December 2005, the deficit had not improved by the same amount as the assets because the liabilities included longer life expectancy assumptions and used a lower discount rate.
Following the valuation, the ordinary contributions rate increased to 19.5% of pensionable salaries including employee contributions of 6% from 18.2% with effect from 1 January 2007.
In 2008, the group made regular contributions of 380 million 2007: 402 million.
In addition, the group agreed to make deficiency payments equivalent to 280 million per annum for ten years.
The first three years instalments have been paid up front: 520 million was paid in 2007 and 320 million was paid in 2008.
Subsequently, annual payments of 280 million will be made, with the next payment due in December 2009.
This compared to annual deficiency payments of 232 million that were determined under the 2002 funding valuation.
The intention is for there to be sufficient assets in the scheme to pay pensions now and in the future.
Without any further contribution from the company, it is estimated that as at 31 December 2005, the assets of the scheme would have been sufficient to provide around 70% of the members benets with an insurance company.
If the group were to become insolvent, however, there are a number of additional protections available to members.
Firstly, there is the Crown Guarantee which was granted when the group was privatised in 1984.
This applies, on a winding up of the group, to pension entitlements for anyone who joined the scheme before 6 August 1984, and to payments to beneciaries of such persons.
Secondly, the Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the scheme and pay certain benets to members.
There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and this would not give exactly the same benets as those provided by the scheme.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years.
The agreed funding plan addresses the deficit over a period of ten years.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age prole of active members will consequently increase.
Under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active members pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment prole extends over more than 60 years.

Directors emoluments and pensions For the year ended 31 March 2008 the aggregate emoluments of the directors was 5,052,000 2007: 5,475,000.
This includes deferred bonuses of 1,877,000 2007: 1,889,000 which have been awarded and are payable in 5p ordinary shares of BT Group plc in three years time subject to continuous employment.
Retirement benets were accruing to one director 2007: two under a dened benefit pension scheme.
During the year one director exercised options 2007: one under BT Group share option plans.
Four directors who held ofce for the whole or part of the year 2007: four received or are entitled to receive 5p ordinary shares of BT Group plc under BT long-term incentive plans.
The aggregate value of BT Group plc shares vested in directors during the year under BT long-term incentive plans was 1,623,000.
The emoluments of the highest paid director were 3,350,000 2007: 3,226,000.
He is entitled to receive 2,138,932 BT Group plc 5p ordinary shares under BT long-term incentive plans subject to continuous employment and in some cases to certain performance conditions being met.
He did not exercise any share options.
Included in the above aggregate emoluments are those of Ben Verwaayen and Hanif Lalani, who are also directors of the ultimate parent company, BT Group plc.
The directors do not believe it is practicable for the purposes of this report to apportion the amounts of total emoluments received by them between their services as directors of the company and their services as directors of BT Group plc.
Share based payments The total charge recognised in 2008 in respect of share based payments was 73 million 2007: 93 million, 2006: 76 million.
The total fair value to be recognised over the vesting period of share options and awards granted in 2008 was 104 million 2007: 92 million, 2006: 105 million.
The ultimate parent company, BT Group plc, has an employee share investment plan and savings-related share option plans for its employees and those of participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected employees and an employee stock purchase plan for employees in the United States.

This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for five year plans and 10% for three year plans.
The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse.
Options are granted annually, usually in June.
Similar plans operate for BTs overseas employees.

Share based payments continued Employee Stock Purchase Plan The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, for employees in the US, enables participants to purchase American Depositary Shares ADSs quarterly at a price the Initial Base Option Price which is 85% of the fair market price of an ADS at the start of the Initial Enrolment Period of, in the case of employees who enrol in the ESPP after the Initial Enrolment Period, 85% of the fair market price of an ADS on the last business day of the calendar quarter immediately following enrolment.
The fifth offer was launched in December 2006, with an Initial Base Option Price of US$46.00 and ended on 31 March 2008.
The following are legacy option plans which are no longer operated by the ultimate parent company.
BT Group Global Share Option Plan GSOP The options granted in previous years were exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets.
Options must be exercised within seven years of the vesting date.
BT Group Legacy Option Plan GLOP On the demerger of 02, BTs share option plans ceased to operate and were replaced by similar BT Group Employee Sharesave plans and the BT Group Global Share Option Plan.
The BT Group Legacy Option Plan was launched on 17 December 2001 following the scheme of arrangement and demerger of 02 in November 2001, and is therefore outside the scope of IFRS 2.
The options were exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets, on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
Share Plans Incentive Share Plan, Deferred Bonus Plan and Retention Share Plan Under the BT Group Incentive Share Plan ISP, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure and if the participants are still employed by the group.
The corporate performance measure is BTs total shareholder return TSR measured against a comparator group of companies from the European Telecom Sector at the beginning of the relevant performance period.
Under the BT Group Retention Share Plan RSP, the length of retention period before awards vest is exible.
Awards may vest annually in tranches.
The shares are transferred at the end of a specified period, only if the employee is still employed by the group.
Under the BT Group Deferred Bonus Plan DBP awards are granted annually to selected employees of the group.
Shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.
In accordance with the terms of the ISP, DBP and RSP, dividends or dividend equivalents earned on shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential benefit of the participants.
Employee Share Investment Plan ESIP The ESIP is an HMRC approved plan that has been in operation since December 2001.
It allows BT employees to buy shares with contributions of up to 1,500 per tax year a gross of pay directshare and allows BT to provide free shares to UK employees which are held in trust for at least three years allshare.
During 2008, 5.4 million directshare shares 2007: 5.3 million directshare shares, were purchased by the Trustee of the ESIP on behalf of 19,603 2007: 15,445 employees at a total cost of 15.8 million 2007: 14.2 million.
A further 1.4 million shares 2007: 1.0 million shares were purchased by the Trustee by dividend reinvestment on behalf of 22,136 2007: 18,789 allshare and directshare employee participants.
During 2008, allshare was replaced by free BT Total Broadband Option 3 for all BT employees in the UK.
Employees outside the UK continue to receive awards of shares where practicable, otherwise they will receive awards equivalent to the value of free shares.

Awards under the ISP have been valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
TSRs were generated for BT and the comparator group at the end of the three year performance period, using each companys volatility and dividend yield, as well as the cross correlation between pairs of stocks.
Volatility has been determined by reference to BTs historical volatility which is expected to reect the BT share price in the future.
The group assumes an expected life of three months after exercise price is assumed for Employee Sharesave options and for all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period.
The risk free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.
The fair values for the RSP and DBP were determined using the middle market share price three days prior to the date of grant.
The weighted average share price for RSP awards granted in 2008 was 310p 2007: 267p, 2006: 216p.
The weighted average share price for DBP awards granted in 2008 was 319p 2007: 232p, 2006: 223p.
Openreach In the Undertakings given to Ofcom on 22 September 2005, BT agreed that the incentive elements of the remuneration of employees within Openreach should be linked to Openreach performance rather than BT targets or share price.
Long-term incentive arrangements are linked to Openreach targets and are paid in cash instead of shares and hence are neither equity settled or cash settled share based payment arrangements.

Other services pursuant to legislation represents fees payable for services in relation to other statutory lings or engagements that are required to be carried out by the appointed auditor.
In particular, this includes fees for audit reports issued on the groups regulatory financial statements.
Tax services represents fees payable for tax compliance and advisory services.
Services relating to corporate finance transactions represent fees payable in relation to due diligence work completed on acquisitions and disposals.
All other services represents fees payable for non-regulatory reporting on internal controls and other advice on accounting matters.
In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what non audit services can be provided by the companys external auditors and the approval processes related to them.
Under those policies work of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear efficiencies and value added benets to the company.
Financial instruments and risk management The group issues or holds financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buy backs and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the groups operations.
The group nances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained profits, deferred taxation, long-term loans and short-term loans, principally by issuing commercial paper supported by committed borrowing facilities.
The group borrows in the major long-term debt markets in major currencies.
Typically, but not exclusively, the bond markets provide the most cost-effective means of long-term borrowing.
The group uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to market risks from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates against these borrowings.
The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The group also uses financial instruments to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from funding its overseas operations, acquisitions, overseas assets, liabilities and forward purchase commitments.
The financial instruments used comprise borrowings in foreign currencies and forward currency contracts.
The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity, funding, investment and counterparty credit risk and the groups market risk exposures, including risk from volatility in currency and interest rates.
The treasury centralised operation acts as a central bank to members of the BT group providing central deposit taking, funding and foreign exchange management services.
Funding and deposit taking is usually provided in the functional currency of the relevant entity.
The centralised treasury operation is not a profit centre and the objective is to manage risk at optimum cost.
The BT Group plc Board sets the policy for the groups centralised treasury operation and its activities are subject to a set of controls commensurate with the magnitude of the borrowings and investments and group wide exposures under its management.
The BT Group plc Board has delegated its authority to operate these polices to a series of panels that are responsible for management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Group Finance Director of the BT Group plc Board.
The key policies dened by the Board are highlighted in each of the sections below.
The financial risk management of exposures arising from trading financial instruments, primarily trade receivables and trade payables, is through a series of policies and procedures set at a group and line of business level.
Line of business management apply such policies and procedures and perform review processes to assess and manage financial risk exposures arising from trading financial instruments.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2008 71 32.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Interest rate risk management The group has interest bearing financial assets and financial liabilities which may expose the group to either interest cash ow or fair value volatility.
The BT Group plc Board policy, is to ensure that at least 70% of BT Group plcs consolidated net debt is at xed rates.
Short term interest rate management is delegated to the centralised treasury operation whilst long-term interest rate management decisions requires further approval from the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director Group Financial Control and Treasury or the Treasurer who have been delegated such authority by the BT Group plc Board.
In order to manage this prole, the group has entered into swap agreements with commercial banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
Under cross currency swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, US dollar and Euro xed rates into either xed or oating Sterling interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
Under Sterling interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the differences between xed rate and oating rate Sterling interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
The group uses a combination of these derivatives to primarily x its interest rates.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to xed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of hedging instruments.
At 31 March 2008, the group had outstanding Sterling interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts totalling 4.8 billion 2007: 5.1 billion.
The group is exposed to income statement and equity volatility arising from changes in interest rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies is a reasonable benchmark for performing a sensitivity analysis.
All adjustments to interest rates for the impacted financial instruments are assumed to take affect from 1 April 2008.
After the impact of hedging, the groups main exposure to interest rate volatility in the income statement arises from fair value movements on derivatives not in hedging relationships, its variable rate borrowings and investments and trade receivables which are largely inuenced by Sterling interest rates.
Interest rate movements on trade payables and other financial instruments do not present a material exposure to interest rate volatility.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of interest bearing financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 March 2008, a 100 basis point increase in Sterling interest rates would increase the groups annual net finance income by approximately 180 million which is consistent with 2007.
The groups main exposure to interest rate volatility within shareholders equity arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The derivatives have an underlying interest exposure to Sterling, Euro and US dollar rates.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of derivatives included in the cash ow reserve at the balance sheet date, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates in each of the currencies would impact equity, pre tax, as follows: 2008 2007 m m 100 basis point increase in: Charge credit Charge credit Sterling interest rates 470 371 US dollar interest rates 347 272 Euro interest rates 91 28 The long-term debt instruments which the group issued in December 2000 and February 2001 both contained covenants providing that if the BT Group plc groups credit rating were downgraded below A3 in the case of Moodys or below Ain the case of Standard & Poors S&P, additional interest would accrue from the next coupon period at a rate of 0.25 percentage points for each ratings category adjustment by each ratings agency.
In July 2006, S&P downgraded BT Groups credit rating to BBB plus and Moodys currently apply a credit rating of Baa1 following a downgrade in May 2001.
Based on the total amount of debt of 4.5 billion outstanding on these instruments at 31 March 2008, BTs annual finance expense would increase by approximately 22 million if BTs credit rating were to be downgraded by one credit rating category by both agencies below a long-term debt rating of Baa1 BBB.
If BTs credit rating with each of Moodys and S&P were to be upgraded by one credit rating category the annual finance expense would be reduced by approximately 22 million.
72 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Foreign exchange risk management The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that the eventual net inows and net outows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
The Board policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the types of transactions which should normally be covered including significant operational, funding and interest exposures and the period over which cover should extend for the different types of transactions.
Short-term foreign exchange management is delegated to the centralised treasury operation whilst long-term foreign exchange management decisions requires further approval from the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director Group Financial Control and Treasury or the Treasurer who have been delegated such authority from the Board.
The policy delegates authority to the Treasurer to take positions of up to 100 million and for the BT Group plc Group Finance Director to take positions of up to 1 billion.
A significant proportion of the groups current revenue is invoiced in pounds Sterling, and a significant element of its operations and costs arise within the UK.
The groups overseas operations generally trade and are funded in their local currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
The groups foreign currency borrowings, which totalled 6.9 billion at 31 March 2008 2007: 5.4 billion, are used to finance its operations and have been predominantly swapped to Sterling.
Cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts have been entered into to reduce the foreign currency exposure on the groups operations and the groups net assets.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency investments, interest expense, capital purchases and purchase and sale commitments on a selective basis.
The commitments hedged are principally US dollar and Euro denominated.
As a result of these policies, the groups exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on the residual currency exposure on its non-UK investments in its subsidiaries and on imbalances between the value of outgoing and incoming international calls.
After hedging, the groups exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement from a 10% strengthening in Sterling against other currencies, based on the composition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, with all other factors remaining constant would be insignicant in both 2008 and 2007.
The groups main exposure to foreign exchange volatility within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The majority of foreign exchange uctuations in the cash ow reserve are recycled immediately to the income statement to match the hedged item and therefore the groups exposure to foreign exchange uctuations in equity is not significant.
At 31 March 2008, the group had outstanding contracts to sell or purchase foreign currency with a total gross notional principal of 7.1 billion 2007: 6.1 billion.
The majority of these instruments were cross currency swaps with a remaining term ranging from 1 to 23 years 2007: 2 months to 24 years.
The notional value of forward currency contracts included in the gross notional principal at 31 March 2008 were 688 million 2007: 1,297 million for purchases of currency and 1 million 2007: 2 million for sales of currency.
The forward currency contracts had a term remaining ranging from 1 to 259 days 2007: 2 to 321 days.
Credit risk management The groups exposure to credit risk arises mainly from financial assets transacted by the centralised treasury operation and from its trading related receivables.
For treasury related balances, the BT Group plc Board dened policy restricts the exposure to any one counterparty and financial instrument by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as dened by Moodys and Standard and Poors and dening the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The minimum credit ratings set are AA3 for long-term and A1 P1 for short-term investments with counterparties.
The centralised treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the size and credit standing of the counterparty up to the maximum allowable limit set by the BT Group plc Board.
Management review significant utilisations on a regular basis to determine adjustments required, if any.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single counterparty, or group of related counterparties, the group may enter into a netting arrangement to reduce the groups exposure to credit risk.
Currently the group makes use of standard International Swaps and Derivative Association ISDA documentation.
In addition, where possible the group will seek a legal right of set off and have the ability and intention to settle net.
The group also seeks collateral or other security where it is considered necessary.
During 2008, the centralised treasury operation tightened the credit limits applied when investing with counterparties and continued to monitor their credit quality in response to market credit conditions.
The groups credit policy for trading related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
The group will also enhance credit protection when appropriate by applying processes which include netting and off-setting, considering the customers exposure to the group and requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
In light of the adverse market conditions the group has taken proactive steps to ensure the impact on trading related financial assets is minimised.
The concentration of credit risk for trading balances of the group is provided in note 13 which analyses outstanding balances by line of business and reects the nature of customers in each segment.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007 is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Derivative financial assets 387 52 Investments 492 516 a Trade and other receivables 22,024 21,618 Cash and cash equivalents 1,418 791 Total 24,321 22,977 a The carrying amount excludes 1,257 million 2007: 1,197 million of current and 854 million 2007: 523 million of non current trade and other receivables which relate to non financial assets.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2008 73 32.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Liquidity risk management The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
On an annual basis the BT Group plc Board reviews and approves the maximum long-term funding of the group.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the centralised treasury operation within the parameters of the policies set by the Board.
The groups liquidity and funding management process includes projecting cash ows and considering the level of liquid assets in relation thereto, monitoring balance sheet liquidity and maintaining a diverse range of funding sources and back-up facilities.
Liquid assets surplus to immediate operating requirements of the group are generally invested and managed by the centralised treasury operation.
Requirements of group companies for operating finance are met whenever possible from central resources.
The group also manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate committed borrowing facilities.
Despite adverse market credit conditions in 2008, the group proactively raised long-term funds of 3.5 billion and short-term funds of 0.4 billion excluding intragroup funding.
A proportion of these borrowings were raised using the groups European Medium Term Note programme and US Shelf registration.
In addition, the group utilised part of its commercial paper programme which is supported by a committed borrowing facility of up to 1,500 million 2007: 1,500 million.
The facility is available for the period to January 2013.
The group had additional undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 835 million 2007: 2,035 million, of which 800 million was agreed in 2008 with a further 100 million agreed after the balance sheet date, is for a term of 364 days and has a one-year term out.
The remaining 35 million was renewed in 2008.
The prior year included a facility of 2,000 million and was available for one year.
Renancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period.
The Groups remaining contractually agreed cash ows, including interest, associated with financial liabilities based on undiscounted cash ows are as follows: Within one year, or Between one and Between two and Between three and Between four and Carrying amount on demand two years three years four years five years After five years Outow inow m m m m m m m 2008 Loans and borrowings 12,642 Principal 2,568 274 2,362 13 1,537 5,646 Interest 753 696 659 478 480 4,700 a Trade and other payables 5,966 5,966 b Provisions 127 31 25 16 14 13 66 Derivative financial instrument liabilities Net settled 446 18 18 18 20 20 66 Gross settled 626 Outow 480 482 2,107 177 305 4,619 Inow 393 365 1,715 137 263 3,756 2007 Loans and borrowings 8,880 Principal 2,304 330 340 2,253 12 3,466 Interest 591 498 470 452 268 3,784 a Trade and other payables 5,387 5,387 b Provisions 146 41 31 25 16 14 59 Derivative financial instrument liabilities Net settled 474 50 49 49 49 37 332 Gross settled 836 Outow 1,135 369 486 2,681 137 4,207 Inow 997 285 387 2,315 117 3,592 a The carrying amount excludes 1,756 million 2007: 1,544 million of current and 707 million 2007: 590 million of non current trade and other payables which relate to non financial liabilities.

c Foreign currency related cash flows were translated at the closing rate at the reporting date.
Future variable interest rate cash flows were calculated using the most recent rate applied at the relevant balance sheet date.
Price risk management The group has limited exposure to equity securities price risk on investments held by the group.
Hedging activities The group entered into a combination of interest rate and cross currency swaps designated as a combination of fair value and cash ow hedges in order to hedge certain risks associated with the groups US dollar and Euro borrowings.
The risks being hedged consist of currency cash ows associated with future interest and principal payments and the fair value risk of certain elements of borrowings arising from uctuations in currency rates and interest rates.
At 31 March 2008, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements in cash ow hedges against borrowings with a total notional principal amount of 2.9 billion 2007: 3.2 billion.
The fair value of these interest rate swaps at the balance sheet date comprised assets of 1 million and liabilities of 207 million 2007: assets of 15 million and liabilities of 234 million.
