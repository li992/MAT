A 10% variation in the valuation of sterling at the balance sheet date would have an impact of 2.9 million 2007: 28.1 million.
All of this would be taken to the income statement.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that specified changes occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause uctuations in exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
