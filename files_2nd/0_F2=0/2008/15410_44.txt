Unless otherwise stated, impairment reviews are carried out in accordance with the methodology set out in Notes 2 and 3. a Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas goodwill of 57 million includes 47 million 2007 47 million relating to the Staley acquisition, which is treated as one cash generating unit CGU for impairment testing purposes as the business is managed as one entity and it is therefore not appropriate to allocate goodwill to individual plants.
Cash flows used were based on the latest approved plans for five years discounted using a pre-tax rate of 11% 2007 13%.
Remaining goodwill relates to Continental Custom Ingredients, which was acquired in 2006.
This business has also been tested for impairment using management projections of cash flows for five years and a pre-tax discount rate of 11% 2007 13%.
In both cases, zero growth was assumed in perpetuity.
No impairment is required for either business.
b Goodwill in the Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe division of 136 million includes 76 million 2007 86 million relating to the acquisition in 2000 of the minority of 34% of shares of the former Amylum business.
Although cash flows have been identified for certain individual plants for the purposes of assessing the recoverable amounts of property, plant and equipment as described in Note 16 the business is managed as a network, with a large amount of interdependency between plants and centralised decision-making.
Consequently, goodwill is monitored at a divisional level and allocated to a group of plant CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing.
On disposal of the European starch plants, an exercise was carried out to assess the amount of goodwill that could be allocated to those businesses that had not been impaired in 2006 and subsequently 15 million was written off.
The remaining goodwill in the former Amylum businesses has been tested for impairment using management projection of cash flows for five years.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 10% and zero growth was assumed in perpetuity.
Management has concluded that no impairment is required.
In 2007, a similar approach was adopted to the impairment test, although fair value less costs to sell was used for the part of the business identified for potential disposal.
For the part of the business that is retained by the Group the recoverable amount was calculated using the same methodology and similar assumptions to the current year.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 12%.
During the year goodwill of 36 million has been recognised on the acquisition of G. C. Hahn & Co. part of Food and Industrial Ingredients, Europe.
No impairment loss was identified in respect of this business.
The remaining goodwill relates to a number of smaller acquisitions, each of which has been tested for impairment using management projections for five years, pre-tax discount rates in the range of 10% to 11% 2007 10% to 13%, and zero growth assumed in perpetuity.
