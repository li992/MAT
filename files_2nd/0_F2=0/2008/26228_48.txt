Group Financial Statements Employee share plan ESP Under the ESP, approved by HMRC, permanent UK employees may elect to purchase Group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis.
The Group supplements the number of shares purchased by matching the first 20 of the employees contributions.
From time to time, the Group may make a grant of free shares.
Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years before they may vest to the employee.
After vesting the shares remain within the Trust until they are transferred to the employee or the employee leaves the Group.
The Trust is consolidated into the results of the Group with the unvested shares disclosed as employee scheme shares.
The fair value of the granted shares is equal to the market value at the grant date.
During the year, 4,329,878 shares 2007: 4,127,529 shares were granted under the ESP.
The weighted average fair value of the shares issued was 117p 2007: 148p.
