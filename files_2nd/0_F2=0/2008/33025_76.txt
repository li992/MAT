7 lITIgATIoN ANd ENvIRoNmENTAl lIAbIlITIES exAntA xImElAgATRAN As previously disclosed, four putative and essentially similar securities class actions were filed in the US against AstraZeneca PLC, Hkan Mogren who currently serves as a Director of AstraZeneca PLC, Sir Tom McKillop, Jonathan Symonds and Percy Barnevik who are former Directors of AstraZeneca PLC between January and March 2005.
These actions were subsequently consolidated into a single action in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The Consolidated Amended Complaint alleged that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding Exanta clinical trials and the status of the Exanta new drug application in the US.
The plaintiffs purport to assert claims on behalf of purchasers of AstraZeneca publicly traded securities during the period April 2003 to September 2004 under sections 10 b and 20 a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5.
In an opinion dated 3 June 2008, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the case in its entirety by granting the motions to dismiss of AstraZeneca PLC and the individual defendants.
Plaintiffs are currently appealing this decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, except for the ruling regarding two of the four individual defendants.
AstraZeneca filed its brief in response to Plaintiffs appeal on 14 October 2008.
AstraZeneca PLC will continue to vigorously defend itself in this matter.
