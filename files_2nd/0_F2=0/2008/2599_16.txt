Impairment tests The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across cash generating units CGUs.
At 31 December 2008 two CGUs, Groupe Pierre Le Goff GPLG and North America, carried a significant amount of goodwill in comparison with the total value of the Groups goodwill.
The carrying value of goodwill in respect of GPLG at 31 December 2008 was 136.1m 2007: 103.0m.
The carrying value of goodwill in respect of North America at 31 December 2008 was 179.1m 2007: 132.7m.
At 31 December 2008 the aggregate amount of goodwill attributable to the Groups CGUs, excluding GPLG and North America, was 470.7m 2007: 370.9m.
Given the similar nature of the activities of each CGU, a consistent methodology is applied across the Group in assessing CGU recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less the costs to sell.
The value in use is the present value of the cash flows expected to be generated by the CGU over a projection period together with a terminal value.
The projection period is the time period over which future cash flows are predicted.
The Groups methodology is to use a projection period of five years.
Cash flow expectations exclude any future cash flows that may arise from restructuring or other enhancements to the cash generating activities of the CGU and reflect managements expectations of the range of economic conditions that may exist over the projection period.
The value in use calculations are principally sensitive to revenue growth, future margins, any significant changes to the customer base and the discount rate used in the present value calculation.
The information used for valuation purposes takes into consideration past experience and the current economic environment with regard to customer attrition rates and additions to the customer base, the ability to introduce price increases and new products and experience in controlling the underlying cost base.
This provides a long term growth rate consistent with the geographic segments in which the Group operates, together with managements assessment of future operating performance and market share movements.
A discount rate of 9.0% 2007: 8.0% has been applied to the value in use calculations representing a pre-tax rate reflecting market assessments of the time value of money at the balance sheet date.
The key assumption on which value in use calculations are dependent is the underlying customer base.
Based on past experience and taking into account current market conditions, management considers that it is reasonable to assume that there will not be a major deterioration in the customer base over the projection period which will significantly impact the future cash flows.
Should such a change occur, this would represent a triggering event to indicate that an impairment review may be necessary.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, a full impairment review would then be undertaken on the relevant assets within the CGU.
Any such changes are monitored through normal monthly procedures.
