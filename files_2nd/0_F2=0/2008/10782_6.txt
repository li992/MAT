The carrying value of the Gray & Osbourn Limited brand name has been determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for this calculation are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and the forecast cash flows.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent two year financial budgets approved by management and thereafter extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity with no growth assumed to reflect that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which cash flows are expected to be generated.

Generally, receivables over 150 days past due are written off in full.
Trade receivables that reach the trigger point of 56 days past due are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts, determined by reference to past default experience.
The carrying amount of trade receivables whose terms have been renegotiated but would otherwise be past due totalled 40.0m at 1 March 2008 2007, 32.0m.
Before accepting any new customer, the group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
Credit limits and scores attributed to customers are reviewed every 28 days.
The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired, with regard to the historical default rate has remained stable.

Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
All customer receivables are unsecured.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

The group use derivatives such as interest rate swaps where appropriate.
Based on weighted average interest rates and the value of bank loans at 1 March 2008 the estimated future interest cost per annum until maturity would be 15m.
At 1 March 2008, the group had available 70m 2007, 176.2m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The Financial Review on page 11 summaries the objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the period.

Financial risk management objectives The financial risks facing the group include currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The group seeks to minimise the effects of certain of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures as governed by the groups policies.
The group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Foreign currency risk management The group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
It is the policy of the group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments for the purchase of overseas sourced products.
Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to three years ahead.

The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.

Where appropriate, exposure to interest rate fluctuations on indebtedness is managed by using derivatives such as interest rate swaps.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis If interest rates had increased by 0.5% and all other variables were held constant, the groups profit before tax for the 53 weeks ended 1 March 2008 would decrease by 1.0m 2007, 0.5m.
This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date and assuming the net debt outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 69 Notes to the Group Accounts 20 Financial instruments continued Credit risk management Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative financial instruments are made through banks which are approved by the board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Customer debtor balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Liquidity risk management The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate banking and borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 18 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the group has at its disposal and details of the groups remaining contractual maturity for its nonderivative financial liabilities.
Fair value of financial instruments Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.

The options awards outstanding at 1 March 2008 had a weighted average exercise price of 92 pence, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.2 years 2007, 5.3 years.
The fair value of management and sharesave options awards granted is calculated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 2008 2007 Weighted average share price at date of grant pence 331 212 Weighted average exercise price pence 154 75 Expected volatility % 35.7 37.0 Expected life years 3.5 5.5 3.5 5.5 Risk-free rate % 4.3 4.3 Dividend yield % 2.4 5.0 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the groups share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The group recognised total expenses of 1.7m and 1.2m related to equity-settled share based payment transactions in 2008 and 2007 respectively.
N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 75 Notes to the Group Accounts 33 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The group is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits.
The only obligation of the group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 0.6m 2007, 0.5m represents contributions payable to the schemes by the group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
As at 1 March 2008, contributions of 0.1m 2007, 0.1m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.

Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable earnings which are salaries and was closed to new members from 31 January 2002.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The scheme is a funded scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 30 June 2006 by an independent qualified actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in determining the groups net retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2008 2007 % % Discount rate 6.1 5.0 Expected return on scheme assets 5.8 5.2 Expected rate of salary increase 5.1 4.6 Future pension increases 2.4 2.0 2008 2007 Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: m m Current service cost 2.3 2.9 Interest cost 3.2 3.2 Expected return on scheme assets 2.7 1.7 2.8 4.4 Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The cumulative actuarial gains since transition to IFRS were 11.3m 2007, 3.4m.
The actual return on scheme assets was 0.8m 2007, 2.6m.
The scheme is a closed scheme and therefore, under the projected unit method, the current service cost would be expected to increase.
