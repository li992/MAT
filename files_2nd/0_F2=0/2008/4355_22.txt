qxd 5 6 08 14:54 Page 58 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 58 Notes to the financial statements 1 Segmental information The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments as the Groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products produced.
The Group is segmented into two divisions, Foods and Dairies according to the nature of the products sold and markets serviced.
The Foods segment comprises predominantly branded cheese and spreads sold via the multiples.
It includes both the UK Spreads business and the St Hubert business acquired in January 2007 since both supply similar product to similar markets using the same production and distribution methods.
The Dairies segment comprises predominantly liquid milk sales via the multiples, middle ground or doorstep.
The Household business is included within the Dairies segment as its operations are mutually interdependent with the liquid milk business.
All revenue is derived from the sale of goods.
Inter-segment sales of cream from Dairies to Foods amounted to 42.6 million in the year ended 31 March 2008 2007: 32.8 million.
The Groups geographical segments are based on the location of the Groups assets.
The Group has two geographical segments being UK and Ireland and Rest of world.
The Wexford business, based in Ireland, generates the majority of its revenue from sales into the UK and operates under similar economic and political conditions to the UK.
As a result, the UK and Ireland businesses have been combined into one geographical segment.
Sales to Rest of world disclosed in geographical segments are based on the geographical location of customers.
The Rest of world category comprises the St Hubert business and ingredients and finished goods exports from the UK.
They exclude deferred taxation, cash and cash equivalents, derivatives held as hedges of borrowings and retirement benefit assets.
Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities.
They exclude taxation, retirement benefit obligations, borrowings and related hedges.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits other than in the trades in which they arose and the future profitability of these trades is uncertain.
The Group has capital losses which arose in the UK of 70.6 million 2007: 74.5 million that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable gains.
Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is no foreseeable prospect of their being utilised.

At 31 March 2008, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2007: nil for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries in Ireland as the Group has determined that retained profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The deferred tax liability arising from the investments in these subsidiaries, which has not been recognised, is 2.8 million 2007: 2.5 million.
The disposal comprised a sale of assets and the 20% minority interest in Haverfordwest Cheese Limited was purchased prior to disposal.

Basic EPS on continuing operations is calculated on the basis of Group profit for the year from continuing operations less profit attributable to minority interests divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP are excluded from the weighted average number of shares in issue used in the calculation of earnings per share.
To show earnings per share on a consistent basis, which in the Directors opinion reflects the ongoing performance of the business more appropriately, adjusted earnings per share amounts have been calculated.
The computation for basic and diluted earnings per share including adjusted earnings per share are as follows: Year ended 31 March 2008 Year ended 31 March 2007 555555555 55555 55555555111 55555555555551 Weighted Weighted average Per share average Per share Earnings no of shares amount Earnings no of shares amount m million pence m million pence 555555555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 Basic EPS on profit for the year Net profit attributable to equity shareholders 54.4 132.3 41.1 49.0 127.2 38.5 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 1.0 0.3 1.1 0.3 555555555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 Diluted EPS on profit for the year 54.4 133.3 40.8 49.0 128.3 38.2 555555555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 Basic EPS from continuing operations Profit from continuing operations attributable to equity shareholders 53.2 132.3 40.2 53.1 127.2 41.7 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 1.0 0.3 1.1 0.3 555555555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 Diluted EPS from continuing operations 53.2 133.3 39.9 53.1 128.3 41.4 555555555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 Adjusted EPS from continuing operations Basic EPS from continuing operations 53.2 132.3 40.2 53.1 127.2 41.7 Exceptional items net of tax 15.9 12.0 7.2 5.7 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets net of tax 6.5 4.9 1.9 1.5 Joint ventures exceptional items net of tax 0.3 0.2 555555555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 Adjusted basic EPS from continuing operations 75.6 132.3 57.1 61.9 127.2 48.7 555555555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 1.0 0.4 1.1 0.5 555555555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations 75.6 133.3 56.7 61.9 128.3 48.2 555555555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 5555 Basic and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations amount to 0.9 pence per share 2007: loss of 3.2 pence per share.

This resulted in an impairment of 1.7 million to property, plant and equipment.

We continue to take actions to improve the efficiency and profitability of our speciality cheese business but the Stilton market in particular remains challenging.
These market pressures inevitably impact the cash generating capacity of this business and management considers it necessary to continue to carry these assets at fair value less costs to sell.
All CGUs are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period.
The discount rate applied to the projections is 8.4% in the UK and 9.1% for St Hubert 2007: 9.3% UK, 10.1% St Hubert.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for UK Spreads, St Hubert and Cheese excluding speciality cheese is 2.0% pa being the estimated UK and Euro zone long-term growth rate adjusted for industry growth rates and extrapolation risks 2007: 2.5%.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for the Dairies CGU is 0%.
Management considers this a cautious assumption in the light of current opportunities in the enlarged Household business but recognise the historical doorstep decline rates experienced.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs at 31 March 2008 is: Dairies 68.6 million 2007: 64.3 million UK Spreads 65.5 million 2007: 65.5 million St Hubert 177.6 million 2007: 151.3 million Speciality cheese nil 2007: nil Cheese excluding Speciality cheese 2.1 million 2007: 2.1 million The figures in detail DC Accounts v5.0.
qxd 4 6 08 18:13 Page 72 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 72 Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Goodwill continued The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations: Gross margin budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected input and output price changes, volume changes, new initiatives and anticipated efficiency improvements.
The budgeted margins form the basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends.
Discount rates reflect managements estimate of the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital WACC for each CGU.
Raw materials prices budgets are prepared using the most up-to-date price and forecast price data available.
The key resources are milk, vegetable oils, fuel oil, diesel, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research adjusted downwards to reflect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three year-time frame.
For the Household business within Dairies, long-term rates of market decline as seen over recent years have been extrapolated forward.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each cash generating unit and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the Spreads, St Hubert and Cheese excluding Speciality Cheese CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the Dairies CGU, there are possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount although management believes that the assumptions used in performing the impairment test for this business are cautious.
The key assumption is future growth rates: Management has assumed no growth after year three in the value in use calculation.
Should any decline in the Dairies business be greater than 5% per annum beyond year three then the value in use for this CGU could be reduced to a value approximately equal to its carrying amount, however management do not consider this a reasonably possible change.

qxd 5 6 08 15:10 Page 74 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 74 Notes to the financial statements continued 15 Investment in joint ventures using equity method The principal investment in joint ventures is represented by a 49% interest in Yoplait Dairy Crest Limited which is involved in the marketing and distribution of chilled yogurts and desserts in the United Kingdom.
The tax charge on exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2008 was nil 2007: 0.1 million.
The joint venture agreement between Dairy Crest and the other joint venture party contains termination provisions that would result in either an extension of the agreement or a possible sale of the 49% interest to the other joint venture party at arms-length fair value On 6 December 2007, the Group acquired a 50% interest in the ordinary share capital of Fayrefield-Foodtec Limited for a consideration of 2.1 million.
On completion, both call and put options were put in place for the remaining 50% of Fayrefield-Foodtec Limited which are exercisable from 6 June 2009 to 6 July 2009, by the other joint venture party or the Group respectively.
Exercise of these options will result in the Group acquiring the remaining 50% based on a multiple of earnings subject to a floor and cap.
The combination of call and put options makes acquisition of the remaining 50% by the Group highly probable, however until exercise of the options the Group does not exercise control.
Therefore the investment in Fayrefield-Foodtec Limited is accounted for using the equity method.
The option to acquire the remaining 50% of Fayrefield-Foodtec Limited had an initial fair value of nil and has an immaterial fair value at 31 March 2008.
Until 30 September 2007 this investment had been disclosed as an investment in joint venture using the equity method.
At this date the carrying value was impaired by 0.6 million to 3.0 million see Note 3.
Trade receivables are non interest bearing and are generally on 30-90 days terms and are shown net of a provision for impairment.
As at 31 March 2008, trade receivables at nominal value of 7.3 million 2007: 6.4 million were impaired and provided for.
This business sells product on the doorstep and to middle ground and foodservice businesses.
The Group has no history of bad debt with regard to sales to large multiple retailers.
There were no impairment provisions on any other class of receivables at 31 March 2008 or 2007.

The value of cash and cash-equivalents for cash flow purposes is 38.9 million 2007: 24.9 million after deducting overdraft balances of 1.4 million 2007: nil see Note 20.
These shares were repurchased on 31 January 2008.

Details of the Groups interest rate management strategy and interest rate swaps are included in notes 31 and 32.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities which, if contravened, would result in its loans becoming immediately repayable.
These covenants specify a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times, and minimum EBITDA to interest ratios of 3.0 times.
No covenants were contravened in the year ended 31 March 2008 2007: None.
At 31 March 2008 the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was below 3.0 times 2007: below 3.0 times.

The Dairy Crest Group pension fund is a final salary scheme that was closed to new employees joining after 30 June 2006.
Employees joining after this date are invited to join a Dairy Crest Group defined contribution plan.
Yoplait Dairy Crest, a 49% owned joint venture, also has a defined benefit pension plan.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Dairy Crest Group pension fund was carried out as at 31 March 2007 by the funds independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially.

Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The expected rate of return on equities of 8% 2007: 8% reflects historic UK equity returns and a reasonable risk premium over gilts.
It is within the range of assumptions typically used by companies of a similar size.
The expected rate of return on bonds of 6.1% 2007: 5.3% is based upon the gross redemption yield available on a similar profile of gilts and corporate bonds.
Included in the above analysis is the Wexford Creamery pension fund.
The net benefit expense in the year ended 31 March 2008 amounted to 0.4 million 2007: 0.3 million.
The fair value of plan assets at 31 March 2008 was 8.6 million 2007: 8.1 million and the defined benefit obligation was 10.6 million 2007: 9.5 million resulting in a scheme deficit of 2.0 million 2007: 1.4 million.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS, and taken directly to equity of 93.2 million, is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004.

The amount of the fine provided is 9.4 million and reflects the early resolution agreement that was reached with the OFT in December 2007.
This fine represents a significant reduction to the amount that could have been imposed by the OFT and is dependent upon the Groups continued full co-operation with the OFT until the conclusion of its investigation.
The possibility of the imposition of a higher fine by the OFT is considered remote given the Groups continuing co-operation in this matter.
Settlement is expected to be reached in the year ending 31 March 2009 and the related provision has been classified as current.
Onerous contract The Group has one milk supply contract with a middle ground customer which, due to recent unprecedented increases in milk costs and subsequent weakening of cream prices has become onerous.
An exceptional provision of 4.4 million was charged in the year, being the best estimate of the present value of future cash outflows resulting from the contractual obligations in the contract see Note 4.
In the year ended 31 March 2008, 1.5 million was charged against this provision with the remainder expected to be charged in the year ending 31 March 2009.
In calculating the amount of cash outflows to the end of this contract, estimates have been made regarding future pricing and volumes.
At 31 March 2008 the ESOP held 751,879 shares 2007: 401,673 shares in the Company at a cost of 3.7 million 2007: 1.2 million.
The ESOP was established in August 1996 to purchase shares in the Company in order to hedge certain future obligations of the Group including shares awarded under the LTISP and the ESOS.
During the year the Trustee of the ESOP issued 249,794 2007: 87,402 shares following exercises of LTISP options.
In addition, the Company issued 600,000 shares to the ESOP in March 2008 at the prevailing market price of 5.40.
The market value of the shares held by the ESOP, which are listed on the London Stock Exchange, was 3.5 million at 31 March 2008 2007: 2.7 million.
The cumulative amount of goodwill charged against the merger reserve is 86.8 million 2007: 86.8 million.
The reserve is not distributable.
The hedging reserve records the movements on designated hedging items, offset by any movements recognised directly in equity on underlying hedging items.
The translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries offset by the movements on loans and derivatives used to hedge the net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The profit for the year dealt with in the accounts of the Company is 22.0 million 2007: 22.0 million including dividends received from subsidiary companies of 50.0 million 2007: 25.0 million.
Dividends paid amounted to 30.8 million 2007: 27.7 million which, along with a credit for share based payments of 3.2 million 2007: 1.9 million and the cost of the cash gift to the ESOP of 3.2 million 2007: nil resulted in a 8.8 million decrease in retained earnings 2007: 3.8 million restated.
In 1996 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Dairy Crest Limited.
Consideration was in the form of cash and the issue of 109.8 million ordinary shares of 25 pence each.
The fair value of the shares issued was estimated as 170.2 million.
The capital reserve of 142.7 million represents the difference between the fair value of shares issued and their nominal value of 27.5 million.
qxd 6 6 08 13:25 Page 86 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 86 Notes to the financial statements continued 27 Share based payment plans Group The Group has three share option schemes in operation.
The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan LTISP This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on i total shareholder return TSR over a three year period versus comparator companies and ii growth in earnings per share or, from August 2006, economic profit.
The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is three years with an exercise period of seven years.
On 2 July 2007 563,314 options were granted under the LTISP scheme August 2006: 542,392.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme All employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase shares.
Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares.
No financial performance criteria are attached to these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months.
In December 2007 1,340,664 options were granted under the Dairy Crest Sharesave scheme at a grant price of 487 pence.
No options were granted in the year ended 31 March 2007.
Dairy Crest Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Options granted under the Dairy Crest ESOS to subscribe for the Companys shares could be exercised up to 2012 but all outstanding options were exercised in the year ended 31 March 2007.
No options have been granted under this scheme since 22 July 2002.
There were no cash settlement alternatives.
In addition, from 2005 06, bonuses earned that are in excess of 50% of basic salary are deferred in shares with a vesting period of three years.
The only vesting condition is continuing employment.
These cost of these shares are charged over four years being the year the bonus related to and the three year vesting period and is based on the number of shares issued and the share price at date of issue.
At 31 March 2008 no ESOS share options were outstanding 31 March 2007: nil.
Sharesave scheme options are exercisable up to September 2011 at prices ranging from 388p to 487p 31 March 2007: exercisable up to September 2009 at prices ranging from 368p to 388p.
LTISP options are exercisable at varying dates up to July 2017 March 2007: August 2016.
The remaining weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2008 is 8.19 years for the LTISP and 2.50 years for the Sharesave Scheme 2007: 8.29 years and 2.33 years respectively.
The weighted average share price on exercise of LTISP options was 6.90 2007: 6.27 and on exercise of Sharesave options was 6.49 2007: 6.55.
qxd 6 6 08 14:00 Page 87 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 87 27 Share based payment plans continued The fair value factor of the Sharesave Scheme options issued in December 2007 is 18% giving a fair value of 0.94 per option granted.
This has been computed using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The number of share options granted has been adjusted for forfeitures in the period to 31 March 2008.
The key assumptions used in the valuation model for the December 2007 grant were: Expected share price volatility 28.3%, risk free rate of interest 4.15% and dividend yield 4.57%.
The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of the option.
There were no Sharesave Scheme options granted during the year ended 31 March 2007.
The LTISP has market and non-market based performance conditions.
The fair value of the market performance element of the LTISP awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The fair value factor for the award made in July 2007 is 59% for the TSR element and 100% for the Economic Profit element August 2006: 68% TSR and 100% Economic Profit giving a fair value of 5.43 per option granted 2007: 4.42.
The non-market performance element of the LTISP is based on economic profit and the charge for this is the value of shares expected to vest calculated by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
There is a reasonable likelihood of the economic profit condition on the 2007 and 2006 LTISP issues being met and a charge has been assumed for this element.
Volatility assumptions are made for Dairy Crest Group plc and comparator companies based on historical volatility of share prices over a period commensurate with the option life.

30 Business combinations 2008 On 17 February 2008, the Group acquired the assets and goodwill of the dairy business of the East of England Co-operative Society for an initial consideration of 4 million.
The provisional fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the business at the date of acquisition was as follows: Fair value Book to Group value m m 5555555555555555555555555 5 5 5 5555 5555 Property, plant and equipment 0.4 0.5 Intangible assets 2.0 Deferred tax 0.7 Inventories 0.2 0.2 Receivables 0.9 0.9 Payables 0.1 0.1 5555555555555555555555555 5 5 5 5555 5555 Net assets 2.7 1.5 5555 Goodwill 2.6 5555555555555555555555555 5 5 5 5555 Consideration 5.3 5555555555555555555555555 5 5 5 5555 Comprising: Cash consideration 4.0 Deferred working capital consideration adjustment 1.0 Professional fees 0.3 5555555555555555555555555 5 5 5 5555 Provisional fair values for the assets and liabilities of these depots have been used to calculate goodwill due to the proximity of the acquisition to 31 March 2008.
Final valuation will take place during the period to 17 February 2009.
Fair value adjustments principally comprise the recognition of two supply contracts as intangible assets along with the related deferred tax liabilities.
During the period, the Group acquired the goodwill of a number of bottled milk buyers for cash consideration of 1.6 million resulting in goodwill of 1.6 million March 2007: 0.7 million.
Included in goodwill for the above acquisitions are certain intangible assets that cannot be separately identified and measured due to their nature.
These include acquired milk rounds lists and assembled workforces.
Management believes that goodwill represents value to the Group for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted.
The majority of the value was assessed to comprise synergy benefits expected to be achieved by merging the businesses acquired into the Groups existing operations.
qxd 6 6 08 13:26 Page 90 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 90 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Business combinations continued The trade and assets acquired as a result of the above acquisitions were absorbed into the wider Dairies business within Dairy Crest Limited.
As a result, disclosure of the profit for the year to 31 March is impracticable.
Similarly, it is impracticable to disclose what Group profit and revenue from continuing operations would have been if the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2007.
Certain fair value adjustments were made in relation to St Hubert in the period to December 2007.
These comprised adjustments to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and deferred tax, and resulted in additional goodwill of 0.6 million being recognised.
2007 On 16 January 2007 the Group acquired the entire share capital of St Hubert SAS, a branded French spreads company for a consideration of 250.2 million.
The provisional fair value of net assets acquired excluding cash of 2.1 million was 100.8 million resulting in goodwill of 149.4 million.
The book value of net assets acquired excluding cash was 2.8 million.
Fair value adjustments totalled 98.0 million principally comprising the recognition of acquired brands as intangible assets and the related deferred tax.

Final valuation took place during the period to December 2007.
Fair value adjustments comprised the recognition of brands as intangible assets see Note 13 and the related deferred tax liability.
From the date of acquisition, St Hubert contributed 1.3 million to Group profit for the year ended 31 March 2007.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2006, the Group profit for the year would have been 53.7 million and revenue from continuing operations would have been 1,359 million.
Included in the 149.4 million of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that could not be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their nature.
On 19 August 2006, the Group acquired the business and assets of the Express Dairies depot operations and the Liverpool and Nottingham dairies from Arla Foods UK plc for a consideration of 41.3 million.
The fair value of the assets acquired was 39.2 million resulting in goodwill of 2.1 million.
The book value of net assets acquired was 32.2 million.
Fair value adjustments totalled 7.0 million principally comprising a revaluation of land and buildings.

As a result, disclosure of the profit for the year to 31 March 2007 was impracticable.
Similarly, it was impracticable to disclose what Group profit and revenue from continuing operations would have been if the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2006.
Fair value adjustments comprised an upward revaluation of land and buildings based on external valuations 6.3 million a reclassification between property, plant and equipment and inventories 0.2 million and an adjustment to accruals 0.7 million.
During the year ended 31 March 2007, the Group acquired the goodwill of a number of bottled milk buyers for cash consideration of 0.7 million resulting in goodwill of 0.7 million after accounting for the fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired of nil book value nil.
During the year, the Group acquired cheese supply contracts for a consideration of 1.4 million, of which 0.3 million was deferred.
No goodwill was recognised on this acquisition see Note 13.
Included in goodwill for Express Dairies and the smaller bottled milk buyers were certain intangible assets that could not be separably identified and measured due to their nature.
These included acquired milk round lists and assembled workforces.
The majority of the value was assessed to comprise of synergy benefits expected to be achieved by merging the business acquired into the Groups existing operations.
On 14 October 2006, the Group completed the disposal of the majority of its retailer branded cheese business to First Milk Limited.
The post-tax results of this business and the loss on disposal were disclosed as discontinued in the year ended 31 March 2007 Foods segment.
Post tax profits for 2006 07 are analysed in Note 8.
31 Financial risk management objectives and policies The objective of the treasury function, which is accountable to the Board, is to manage the Groups and Companys financial risk, secure cost-effective funding for the Groups operations and to minimise the effects of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates on the value of the Groups and Companys financial assets and liabilities, on reported profitability and on cash flows.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions: principally interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2008 and 2007, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, price risk and credit risk.
Information on how these risks arise is set out below, as are the objectives, policies and processes agreed by the Board for their management and the methods used to measure each risk.
Derivative instruments are used to change the economic characteristics of financial instruments in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in the Accounting Policies note.
qxd 4 6 08 18:15 Page 92 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 92 Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure that forecast net borrowings, plus a reasonable operating headroom, are covered by committed facilities which mature at least 12 months after the year end.
The maturity analysis of Group borrowings is set out in Note 20.
At 31 March 2008 the Groups total credit facilities amounted to 632 million 2007: 624 million excluding finance leases of 16 million 2007: 17 million and the impact of cross-currency swaps on $US loan notes of 15.8 million 2007: 14.3 million.
The facilities consist of: a term loan of 25 million repayable in semi-annual instalments in June 2008 20 million and December 2008 5 million 2007: 45 million, repayable from December 2007 to December 2008 : a 250 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in June 2009 2007: 250 million : a 100 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in November 2011 2007: 100 million : Loan notes totalling 257 million repayable between April 2013 and April 2017 2007: 129 million repayable between April 2013 and April 2016.
In March 2007 there was an additional 100 million 364 day multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable in November 2007 this was repaid on 5 April 2007 from the proceeds of a loan note issue of 150 million and 10 million on 4 April 2007.
Undrawn revolving credit facilities at 31 March 2008 amounted to 150 million 2007: 179 million.
The amount of Euros that can be drawn down is calculated by reference to the rate of exchange at each draw down date.
This can result in reported debt under this facility being higher than the Sterling equivalent facility at a reporting date if Sterling has weakened against the Euro post draw down.
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by closely managing cash generation by its operating businesses and monitoring performance to budgets and forecasts.
Capital investment is carefully controlled, with detailed authorisation limits in place up to Executive level and cash payback criteria considered as part of the investment appraisal process.
Short-term and long-term cash and debt forecasts are constantly reviewed and there are regular treasury updates to the Executive highlighting facility headroom and net debt performance.
Day-to-day cash management utilises undrawn revolving credit facilities, overdraft facilities and occasionally short-term money market deposits if there is excess cash.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations with a floating interest rate.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
Specifically, to keep between one third and three quarters of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group has issued fixed coupon loan notes and also enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of its floating bank borrowings, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt interest cash flow obligations.
At 31 March 2008, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 67% of the Groups borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest 2007: 43%.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is shown by way of a sensitivity analysis in Note 32.
qxd 5 6 08 17:47 Page 93 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 93 31 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Foreign currency risk The Group has invested in operations outside the UK and also buys and sells a small amount of goods in currencies other than Sterling.
As a result the value of the Groups non-Sterling revenues, purchases, assets, liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates predominantly Euro Sterling.
The Group mitigates the effect of its structural currency exposures by borrowing in the same functional currency as the foreign operation into which it invests.
The foreign operations hedged in this way are St Hubert SAS France and Wexford Creamery Limited Ireland : both are Euro-denominated subsidiaries.
Our policy is to hedge 100% of the net asset exposure of these subsidiaries through borrowings and or cross-currency swaps in Euros.
No hedging of earnings exposure is undertaken.
At present, our only currency exposure is Euros.
At 31 March 2008, all borrowings designated as a net investment hedge are done so on a pre-tax basis and no cross-currency swaps are utilised as part of the hedging relationship.
For part of the year, cross-currency swaps were used as part of the designated hedge relationship and this and an element of Euro-denominated borrowings were designated as a post-tax hedge of the St Hubert net investment.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the relevant entitys functional currency and therefore transaction exposures are limited.
This can be seen in Note 17 where the only significant non-Sterling debtors are in Euros and these predominantly relate to the functional currency of St Hubert and Wexford.
The Group trades skimmed milk products and bulk butter mainly to customers in Europe and Central and South America.
The Group also exports its own skimmed milk products, bulk butter and other branded products.
The Groups policy requires foreign currency sales and purchases through Philpot Dairy Products Limited, a subsidiary company, to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts once the transaction is committed so that the margin on the transaction can be fixed.
In addition, a substantial part of Yoplait Dairy Crests purchases are denominated in Euros, which are hedged for at least one year in advance by foreign exchange contracts.
There are currently no sales between the UK business and St Hubert SAS.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as certain capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.
In April 2006, the Group issued loan notes denominated in $US.
At the same time, cross-currency swaps were implemented to hedge the interest and principal repayment cash flows.
The principal amount and interest and principal payment dates on these swaps match those on the loan notes exactly and all swaps are with counterparties with strong credit ratings.
There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to $US debts as any retranslation impact on the profit and loss account is offset by recycling of amounts from the statement of recognised income and expense.
Price risk The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Groups businesses.
The principal non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity, diesel, heavy fuel oil HFO and crude oil by-products used in packaging.
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on profitability and to assess whether the amount of forward cover is appropriate.
Vegetable oil contracts are usually structured such that between six and nine months purchases are at fixed prices.
Energy is generally contracted one season in advance for both Summer and Winter energy but with some requirement contracted at more regular intervals.
Diesel and HFO is not generally contracted at fixed prices although from time to time, forward contracts have been put in place to fix future prices.
The Group regularly reviews relevant commodity markets and levels of future cover.
Fixed price contracts are only entered into with the approval of the Executive Directors.
Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
The Group only offers these terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups history of bad debt losses is not significant.
The Household doorstep business trades with individuals and receives cash payments on a weekly basis.
Cash and debt management is a crucial part of this business and cash collection and balances due are closely monitored to ensure write-downs are minimised.
Debtor days outstanding are closely monitored throughout the year and action is taken promptly where payment terms have been breached.
qxd 4 6 08 18:15 Page 94 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 94 Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other debtors excludes prepayments and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of 219.7 million 2007: 175.8 million.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
All borrowings are through banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above.
Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are invested overnight through deposit accounts with commercial banks with a credit rating of AA or better.
The Group currently has no requirement to place deposits for a longer period, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be low.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate level of gearing in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
In addition, the Group monitors its forecast net debt to EBITDA ratios in order that they are comfortably within its banking covenant requirements.
The maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio for the purposes of bank covenants is 3.5 times.
The Group monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions or changes in Group structure.
Possible mechanisms for changing capital structure include adjusting the level of dividends, issuance of new shares or returning capital to shareholders.
In November 2006, as part of the acquisition of St Hubert, 6,250,000 ordinary shares were issued in order that an appropriate capital structure was maintained.
No significant changes in capital structure have been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2008 and there have been no changes in the objectives, policies and procedures during the last two years.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by shareholders funds.
The definition of net debt is included in Note 34.
The dividend policy is to maintain a progressive dividend policy whilst maintaining an appropriate level of dividend cover.
Total dividends paid and proposed in the year ended 31 March 2008 of 24.4 pence represents growth of 6.6% 2007: 22.9 pence and 6.5% growth.
qxd 6 6 08 13:20 Page 95 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 95 32 Financial instruments An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the discussion of Treasury policies in Note 31.
Consolidated Interest rate maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities The following table sets out the carrying amount, by maturity, of the Groups financial assets and liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk.
No other financial assets and liabilities, other than those shown below, are exposed directly to interest rate risk.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity resulting from movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash flow hedge on $US loan notes.
The impact on equity is nil over the life of the instruments as these swaps comprise a perfectly effective hedge.
For this reason the analysis has been excluded from the table below.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative floating rate financial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash flow hedges.
This is due to the fact that gains and losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative floating rate financial instrument which are subject to the hedge are matched in both profit and loss and cash terms.
No non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments have profit and loss exposure to floating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.
qxd 5 6 08 17:45 Page 96 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 96 Notes to the financial statements continued 32 Financial instruments continued The 2008 analysis below reflects a larger reasonably possible change in interest rates than in 2007 due to increased volatility in financial markets.
Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group unless otherwise disclosed.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date see Note 31.
Foreign currency risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in Sterling Euro exchange rate with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax and the Groups equity.
The impact on equity is minimal as all overseas net investments are 100% hedged and there is a minimal level of forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
Movements in the $US GBP exchange rate have no impact on profit before tax.
There is an impact on equity of cross-currency swaps used to hedge $US denominated loan notes, however, over the life of the instruments, the equity impact is nil and therefore this has been excluded from the above table.

The fair value of interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts has been determined by the third party financial institution with whom the Group holds the instrument, in line with the market value of similar instruments.
The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2008 was 74 million 59 million 2007: 74 million 50 million.
Interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
The floating rate of interest on the receipt leg of these swaps is EURIBOR plus 57.5 basis points being 4.575% 2007: EURIBOR plus 62.5 basis points being 4.375%.
The average effective fixed rate is therefore 4.05% plus 57.5 basis points being 4.63% 2007: 4.05% plus 62.5 basis points being 4.67%.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement during the next four years being the life of the swap 2007: five years.
Cross currency swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding USD GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2008 was $233 million 133 million 2007: $233 million, 133 million.
These cross-currency swaps have both legs at fixed interest rates, are designated as cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2008 and 2007 the fixed interest rates vary from 5.305% to 5.315%.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement during the next five to eight years being the life of the swaps.
During the year, a further cross currency swap contract for a notional principal amount of 72 million 2007: nil was designated as part of a post-tax hedge of the net asset investment in St Hubert SAS along with Euro denominated borrowings.
This swap had both legs at floating interest with the Group paying three month EURIBOR and receiving three month LIBOR.
The swap was closed in March 2008 at a closing rate of EUR GBP 1.2699, with Euro-denominated borrowings all being designated as a pre-tax net investment hedge for St Hubert at 31 March 2008.
The loss on closure of this swap has been separately identified in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entities The Group has Euro denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of i the net asset investment in St Hubert SAS, its subsidiary in France along with the cross-currency swap referred to above ii the net asset investment in Wexford Creamery Limited, its subsidiary in Ireland.
The fair value of the Euro borrowings at 31 March 2008 was 299.4 million 2007: 265.6 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 47.1 million 2007: 2.7 million on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in reserves.
qxd 6 6 08 13:19 Page 99 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 99 32 Financial instruments continued Forward currency contracts The Group has entered into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases and receipts.
These forward currency purchases have been designated cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
They all have a duration of less than one year and the amounts recycled into the Income Statement are reported in cost of sales.
Borrowing facilities The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2008 of 150 million 2007: 179 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.
These undrawn facilities expire in June 2009.
On 5 April 2007, 100 million of revolving credit facilities were repaid and cancelled.
These facilities were replaced by loan notes of 150m and 10m issued on 4 April 2007 maturing 4 April 2014 and 4 April 2017.
Company Interest rate maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities The following table sets out the carrying amount, by maturity of the Companys financial assets and liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk.
qxd 5 6 08 17:40 Page 100 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2008 100 Notes to the financial statements continued 32 Financial instruments continued The 2008 analysis below reflects a larger reasonably possible change in interest rates than in 2007 due to increased volatility in financial markets since March 2007.
Credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of financial assets.
Foreign currency risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in Sterling Euro exchange rate with all other variables held constant, of the Companys profit before tax and the Companys equity.
Internal cross-currency swaps are not designated as hedges under IAS 39.

Other receivables comprise intercompany balances with Dairy Crest Limited.
All intercompany balances are repayable on demand and those on which interest is receivable payable include: an intercompany loan from Dairy Crest Limited of 169.1 million 2007: 150.6 million on which interest is receivable at 5.3% 2007: 5.3% : an intercompany loan from Dairy Crest Limited of 45.0 million 2007: 42.2 million on which interest is payable at LIBOR 100 basis points 2007: LIBOR 100 basis points.
A convertible loan was issued by Dairy Crest Limited to Dairy Crest Group plc on 15 January 2007.
The loan had a principal value of 236.0 million with a coupon of 0.1% per annum.
On 31 March 2009 it will either be repaid in full by Dairy Crest Limited or convert into 57.8 million ordinary shares in Dairy Crest Limited and 23.6 million of loan notes paying LIBOR plus margin maturing 29 March 2019.
The convertible loan has been designated as at fair value through profit and loss having satisfied the conditions in IAS 39 paragraph 11A.
Since the loan is neither an equity investment nor currently convertible, it is within the scope of IAS 39.
In addition, as described above, the convertible loan contains a derivative, namely a call option to acquire an equity interest in Dairy Crest Limited which meets the requirements in IAS 39 paragraph 11A.
The convertible loan is carried at fair value with any gains or losses taken to the income statement.
At 31 March 2008 an external valuation was undertaken resulting in a loss on the convertible loan of 12.3 million 2007: gain of 4.0 million.
The convertible loan is not traded in a publicly quoted market therefore a Black-Scholes Option Pricing model was used in order to value the equity portion of the loan.
The input assumptions used were as follows: dividend yield 2.6% 2007: 2.6%, volatility 23% 2007: 21%, risk free rate 5.0% 2007: 5.4% time to expiry one year 2007: two years.
Dairy Crest Limited is the principal UK Group trading company and therefore the exposure to credit risk on the convertible loan is nil.

The Company receives EURIBOR and pays LIBOR.
Intercompany cross-currency swaps have not been designated as cash flow hedges and any gain or loss arising on revaluation is credited or charged to the income statement.
These swaps are used in order to minimise currency exchange risk in the Company and match the 349 million 279 million of external Euro-denominated borrowings at 31 March 2008 2007: 350 million.
Borrowing facilities The Company has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2008 of 150 million 2007: 179 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.

Under IFRS, Dollar long-term borrowings are retranslated into Sterling at year end exchange rates.
The cross-currency swaps are recorded at fair value Note 32 and incorporate movements in both market exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group defines net debt so as to include the effective Sterling liability where cross-currency swaps have been used to convert foreign currency borrowings into Sterling.
The 15.8 million adjustment included above 2007: 14.3 million converts the Sterling equivalent of Dollar loan notes from year end exchange rates 117.2 million 2007: 118.7 million to the fixed Sterling liability 133.0 million 2007: 133.0 million.
This amount forms part of the overall swap fair value of 3.9 million 2007: 7.9 million shown in Note 32.
