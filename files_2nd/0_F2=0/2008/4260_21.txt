gLOSSARY OF INDUSTRY TERMS A-GPS: assisted GPS: an augmentation to GPS where products are end products and modules which are download: to receive data from a remote or central 106 the mobile phone network can provide the almanac and Bluetooth qualified system.
A download is any file that is offered for ephemeris data.
By using the mobile phone network, the downloading or that has been downloaded Bluetooth specification: the specification determined GPS receiver does not need to decode data from the by the SIG which defines the parameters which a device DRM: digital rights management: the process which satellites, thus both speeding up acquisition of a fix and providing a Bluetooth system must meet: different versions controls access to music files only to those who have paid allowing fixes to be made in areas where GPS signals are of the Bluetooth specification are designated v1.0, v1.1, the required subscription fee too weak to allow decoding of data but are nonetheless v1.2 and v2.0 strong enough to be used to measure time of arrival see EDR: Enhanced Data Rate is an extension of the also GPS CDMA: code division multiple access is the means by Bluetooth standard enabling faster communication which many users of radio waves can communicate using of larger files videos and music by a rate of up to three AMP: stands for Alternate MAC PHY, which is an the same frequency but different unique codes so that times faster than conventional methods architecture being specified by the Bluetooth SIG to the only people able to understand the communication allow faster throughput of a Bluetooth link.
PHY and E-GPS: enhanced GPS: as the name suggests an are the sender and receiver MAC refer to the PHYsical and the Media Access Control enhancement to GPS whereby measurements are made that are two parts of a multi-tiered system comprising cellular cellular device: derives from cellphone by the GPS receiver on the signals received from the the communication system between devices.
Within and means a mobile phone or other device which mobile phone network which allow both fine time and AMP, Bluetooth is used firstly to create the wireless communicates through a network of radio cells frequency assistance to the GPS receiver.
This further communication link between two devices in the normal accelerates acquisition of a fix, as well as allowing, when way.
Bluetooth then decides whether the form of CMOS: Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor GPS signals are unavailable, fall-back to a fix made solely connection between the two devices needs to change technology: a semiconductor process technology that from the measurements made on the cellular network see from Bluetooth to a higher data rate wireless connectivity uses planar transistors to make chips that consume also GPS such as 802.11 or UWB, based on the size of the data file relatively low power and permit a high level of integration being transmitted between the devices where for example embedded solution: a system in which all processing the file is a video sequence.
The Bluetooth seamlessly chip: short for a microchip: semiconductor device is carried out on-chip without the need for an external uses the AMP architecture to switch to a higher data or integrated circuit host processor rate channel such as 802.11 or UWB, which the two devices share without the need for the consumer to make chipset: the term chipset is commonly used to refer to end products: products from a manufacturer which are the decision.
