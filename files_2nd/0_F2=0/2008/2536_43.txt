A description of each of the significant fair value adjustments is given below: Intangible assets an assessment has identified the following classes of intangible assets: franchise arrangements, customer lists and trademarks.
The valuation of each class, and useful economic lives of the intangibles, have been determined as at the date of acquisition based on the Britvic Groups accounting policies.
Property, plant and equipment the assets held have been assessed based on market values of land and buildings and an impairment review of plant and machinery has been performed.
Inventories alignment to Britvic Groups accounting policies in respect of the basis of inventory provisions and categorisation of assets.
Trade and other receivables alignment with Britvic Groups accounting policy to write off marketing costs as incurred.
Trade and other payables alignment with Britvic Groups accounting policy to recognise a holiday pay accrual in accordance with International Accounting Standards Britvic Ireland previously reported in accordance with Irish GAAP.
Pension liability a valuation of the pension liabilities in respect of the two schemes relating to the business has been provided by a qualified actuary.
Deferred tax liability recognition of deferred tax assets liabilities in respect of the fair value adjustments.
From the date of acquisition to 30 September 2007, the acquired businesses contributed 13.8m to revenue and 0.8m to operating profit before tax for the period.
It contributed 5.7m to the Groups net operating cash flow.
The Britvic Ireland companies that have been acquired in this business combination had not previously been deemed a group and therefore had not produced consolidated financial information.
As such there are certain costs that are not easily identifiable and it is therefore impracticable to state what the contribution to Group revenue and profit before tax would have been had the business combination completed on the first day of the financial period in which the combination took place.
