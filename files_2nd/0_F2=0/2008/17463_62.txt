annual report and accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 continued 36 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of pension plans for its qualifying employees.
The principal plans are three defined benefit schemes in the UK and two defined benefit schemes in Germany.
With the exception of one scheme in Germany, the defined benefit schemes are funded and assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
For the Fondsdepot Bank scheme, there is no separate Contractual Trust Agreement which is in line with many German companies schemes.
As a result, pension liabilities are fully recognised on the balance sheet as a retirement benefit obligation with pension assets being integrated with the business assets.
The Group also participates in a number of multi-employer defined benefit schemes and operates a number of defined contribution schemes.
The Group introduced a salary sacrifice arrangement during 2008 for members of certain schemes.
i Defined benefit schemes The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit plans in the UK and Germany which are accounted for as defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuations undertaken by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the funding position of the plans at 31 December each year.
Plan assets are shown at the bid value at 31 December each year.
Financial assumptions The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions are as follows: 2008 2007 UK Germany UK Germany % % % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.80 2.50 4.10 2.50 Rate of increase in pensions in payment RPI up to 5% 2.70 n a 3.00 n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment fixed 5% 5.00 n a 5.00 n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment RPI up to 2.5% 2.00 n a 2.10 n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment n a 2.00 n a 2.00 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.80 2.00 3.10 2.00 Discount rate 6.40 5.75 5.90 5.50 Inflation assumption 2.80 2.00 3.10 2.00 Long-term rate of return expected at 31 December n a 5.00 n a 5.00 equities 7.30 n a 8.00 n a gilts 3.80 n a 4.50 n a bonds 6.40 n a 5.90 n a Expected return on plan assets 5.10 5.98 5.00 5.50 6.58 5.00 To develop the assumption around the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the portfolio.
The post-retirement mortality tables used for the schemes are based on country-specific mortality tables, namely the PA 00 series in the UK based on year of birth with a scaling factor of 110% 2007: 130% and with allowance for medium cohort improvements and Richtaffeln 2005 G, Heubeck-Richtaffeln GmbH, Kln 2005 in Germany.
