Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2007 08 9 Notes to the Group financial statements for the financial period ended 30 April 2008 12 Intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and tested annually for impairment based on value in use.
Goodwill is tested more frequently if there are indications that it might be impaired.
Cash generating units are independent sources of income and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at a country, divisional, regional or store level.
Goodwill has been aggregated at a higher country level.
The carrying amount of goodwill by business segments are as follows: France UK Continuing Darty Comet Other Group m m m m At 30 April 2008 1.
Goodwill impairment review Included within the Menaje del Hogar EMH goodwill is 90. m that arose on the acquisition of EMH in September 2007.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation for the EMH goodwill were: future operating cash flows for the EMH business were derived using managements latest five-year forecasts.
A terminal value was calculated based on the forecast for 201. a long-term growth rate of.
per cent was assumed for EMH turnover, which represents the long-term historic growth rate of the Spanish economy.
a post-tax discount factor of 7.8 per cent, derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital, was used to discount the future cash flows.
The pre-tax discount factor was 11.8 per cent.
Whilst management are confident that their assumptions are appropriate, it is possible that there would be an impairment were there to be a change in certain key assumptions.
The carrying value of EMH is 1 0.0m, including 90. m of goodwill and the recoverable amount, as measured by a value-in-use calculation, was 171.0m.
If the key assumptions were to move by the following amounts, then value in use would equal recoverable amount, assuming these changes happen in isolation: the long term growth rate fell 112 basis points from 201 through to perpetuity: the post-tax discount factor increased by 89 basis points: or the earnings in 201 used to determine the terminal value fell by 2 per cent.
For other goodwill, value in use calculations have been performed using growth rates and discount factors considered appropriate for the relevant cash generating units.
No goodwill impairment was charged in the income statement during the year 2007: nil.
Other intangibles Other intangibles include amounts paid in order to gain access to certain leasehold premises and acquired intangibles.
2m for acquired intangibles, consisting of 11. m for brands and 2.8m of favourable lease contracts.
