62 Notes to the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2008 1.
General information United Business Media Limited UBML is a company incorporated in Jersey under the Companies Jersey Law 1991.
The address of the registered office is Whiteley Chambers, Don Street, St. Helier, JE4 9WG, Jersey.
UBML is tax resident in the Republic of Ireland.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 3.
The Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 were authorised for issue on behalf of the Board of Directors and signed on the Boards behalf by David Levin and Nigel Wilson on 3 March 2009.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all amounts are rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 2.
The comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2007 has been restated as follows: The segmental results have been restated and the impact is disclosed in Note 3.
Acquisition accounting adjustments have been finalised in relation to certain acquisitions which were made in 2007.
The comparative information has been restated in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The impact of this restatement is to increase goodwill, prepayments and accrued income and accruals and deferred income by 3.1m, 1.4m and 4.3m respectively, with a corresponding reduction to property, plant and equipment of 0.2m.
The retirement benefit surplus has been restated in accordance with IFRIC 14 to reduce the carrying amount by the recognition of tax that would become payable if the surplus were ultimately repaid to the Group.
The impact of this was to reduce the retirement benefit surplus, deferred tax liabilities and retained earnings by 14.1m, 13.7m and 0.4m respectively.
For further details refer to Note 24.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
Management continually evaluate these estimates, assumptions and judgements based on available information and experience.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity include goodwill, tax, pensions and provisions.
The appropriate sections within Note 2 provide further information regarding these areas.
New holding company and other changes to composition of Group On 1 July 2008, as part of a reorganisation of the corporate structure of the Group, UBML was created as a new holding company and parent company of the Group.
UBML is UK-listed, incorporated in Jersey and with its tax residence in the Republic of Ireland.
United Business Media plc UBM plc became a subsidiary of UBML.
The former UBM plc shareholders were issued new shares in UBML on a one-for-one basis following a Scheme of Arrangement the Scheme under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 which was approved by UBM plc shareholders.
Immediately following the Scheme, the former shareholders of UBM plc held the same economic interest in UBML as they held in UBM plc immediately prior to its implementation.
The acquisition of UBM plc by UBML falls outside the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Following the guidance regarding the selection of an appropriate accounting policy provided by IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, the transaction has been accounted for in these financial statements using the pooling of interests method, which reflects the economic substance of the transaction.
In accordance with the requirements of the pooling of interests method, the comparative information in these Group financial statements has been extracted from the consolidated financial statements of UBM plc and the financial statements of the combined Group represent a continuation of UBM plcs financial statements.
The assets and liabilities of UBM plc and UBML are recognised and measured in these financial statements at their pre-combination carrying amounts.
The Group has made a number of acquisitions in the year as disclosed in Note 29.
These acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Jersey Law 1991.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of UBML and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared to the same reporting date as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Significant accounting policies continued b Associates The Groups investments in its associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
These are entities in which the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures.
The financial statements of the associates are used by the Group to apply the equity method.
The reporting dates of the associates and the Group are identical and the accounts are prepared on the basis of the Groups accounting policies.
Under the equity method, the income statement reflects the share of the results of operations of the associates.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the associates equity, the Group recognises its share of any changes.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
c Joint ventures The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures.
The Groups interests in its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
These are entities over which the Group has entered into an agreement with a third party to share control.
The financial statements of the joint ventures are used by the Group to apply the equity method.
The reporting dates of the joint ventures and the Group are identical and the accounts are prepared on the basis of the Groups accounting policies.
Under the equity method, the income statement reflects the share of the results of operations of the joint ventures.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the joint ventures equity, the Group recognises its share of any changes.
When the Groups share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
Revenue Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services, net of trade discounts, VAT, other sales related taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue is recognised as follows: For sales of services, revenue is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered by reference to stage of completion of the specific transaction assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided.
For sales of goods, revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
B2B Distribution, Monitoring and Targeting Revenue from news releases is recognised on message delivery.
Revenue from subscriptions is recognised over the life of the subscription.
B2B Communities Exhibitions: revenue is recognised when the show has been completed.
Deposits received in advance are recorded as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Directories: advertising revenue is recognised on issue of the directory and copy sales revenue is recognised on the sale of the directory.
Online: revenue is recognised at the point of delivery or fulfilment for single discrete services and over the life of subscriptions for subscription services.
Data services: revenue from data subscriptions is recognised over the life of the subscription.
Revenue from data projects for immediate delivery is recognised on delivery of the data.
Revenue from data projects is recognised on a percentage completion basis over the life of the project.
Publishing: advertising revenue is recognised on issue of the publication.
Interest and other income a Interest income Income is recognised as the interest accrues using the effective interest rate method: that is, the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
b Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the payment is established.
c Rental Income Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease terms on ongoing leases.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
64 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued at 31 December 2008 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less any depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on all items except freehold land.
Depreciation rates are calculated so that assets are written down to residual value in equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives, which are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold property Up to 70 years Leasehold improvements Term of lease General plant, machinery and equipment 520 years Computer equipment 35 years Motor vehicles 35 years An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement in the year the asset is derecognised.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of the assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Goodwill and intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination including directly related professional fees over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to the relevant cash-generating unit CGU.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
The impairment review requires management to undertake certain judgements, including estimating the recoverable value of the CGU to which the goodwill relates, based on either fair value less costs to sell or the value in use, in order to reach a conclusion on whether it deems the goodwill to be recoverable.
Estimating the fair value less costs to sell is based on the best information available, and refers to the amount at which the CGU could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties.
The valuation methods are based on an earnings multiple approach.
The earnings multiple approach uses transaction multiples, obtained from comparable businesses in the professional media sector.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects managements estimate of return on capital employed required in each CGU which is subject to a value in use calculation.
Management is assisted by the work of external advisors in calculating the fair value less costs to sell and value in use of its CGUs.
Further details are given in Note 12.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Where goodwill forms part of a CGU and part of the CGU is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposal is included in the net assets attributed to the disposal when determining the gain or loss on disposal.
b Intangible assets Website development costs relating to the application and infrastructure development, graphical design and content development stages incurred with third parties are recognised as assets and measured at cost.
All other internally generated intangible assets, including internally generated software, are recognised as an expense in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost or fair value at the date of acquisition less any amortisation and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives as follows: Useful Lives Method Brands 10 years Straight line Software 56 years Straight line Customer contracts and relationships 110 years Straight line Subscription lists 25 years Straight line Trademarks 10 years Straight line Databases 210 years Straight line Website development costs 3 years Straight line Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable are made on a prospective basis.
The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Impairment of assets Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For purposes of assessing impairment, assets that do not individually generate cash flows are assessed as part of the cash-generating unit to which they belong.
Cash-generating units are the lowest levels for which there are cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets.
Significant accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories and work in progress are valued on the first in first out basis at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises materials and directly attributable production costs.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
The Group does not have any finance leases.
The Group is also not involved in any arrangements which fall within the scope of IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease.
a Group as a lessee Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
b Group as a lessor Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same bases as rental income.
Financial instruments Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss derivative financial liabilities or financial liabilities at amortised cost borrowings and trade and other payables.
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, and in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, after taking account of directly attributable transaction costs.
a Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 3090 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when there is no expectation of recovery.
For more details refer to Note 21. b Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, deposits and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts which are shown within borrowings.
c Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised at original cost.
d Borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost, and any difference between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
e Other investments The Group classifies its investments at initial recognition as available-for-sale financial assets.
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Listed and unlisted investments are stated at fair value, except where there is no market value in an active market and where the fair value cannot be reliably measured, in which case they are measured at cost.
Gains and losses on remeasurement to fair value are included in equity until the investment is disposed of or deemed to be impaired when they are transferred to profit or loss.
f Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market rates of interest.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction: or as a hedge of net investment in foreign operations.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions are recognised directly in equity.
Amounts deferred in this way are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm commitments or forecast transactions are recognised in the income statement.
See Note 21 for more details on the Groups cash flow hedges.
In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
The Group has not designated any fair value hedges in either the current or preceding accounting year.
66 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued at 31 December 2008 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued f Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities continued Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Net investment hedges take the form of foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts.
All foreign exchange gains or losses arising on translation of net investments are recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense and included in cumulative translation differences.
Borrowings and forward currency contracts used as hedging instruments in a net investment hedge are revalued at closing exchange rates.
The resulting gains or losses are taken to the statement of recognised income and expense to the extent that they are effective, with any ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement.
See Note 21 for more details on the Groups net investment hedges.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in equity are retained until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
g Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the year.
The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity, which was set to zero on first time adoption of IFRS.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
Tax The income tax expense represents both the current tax payable, based on profits for the year and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the income tax is also charged or credited to equity.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
The Group is a multi-national Group with tax affairs in many geographical locations.
This inherently leads to a higher than usual complexity to the Groups tax structure and makes a degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The timing of resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items.
As a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the income statement and tax payments.
The Group has an accrual for tax liabilities which is measured at the directors estimate of tax that may become payable.
These tax accruals are estimates and the actual amounts and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events.
Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period such determination is made.
For more details refer to Note 9.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Significant accounting policies continued Pensions The Group sponsors a number of defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
For the defined contribution schemes, the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of employee service rendered during the accounting period are recognised as an expense in that period.
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the liability for the benefits earned by employees in return for service rendered in the current and prior periods is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by independent qualified actuaries.
This is based upon a number of financial assumptions, the determination of which is significant to the balance sheet valuation.
These are set out and discussed in Note 24.
The following is charged to operating profit: the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities arising from employee service in the current period: the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities as a result of benefit improvements over the period during which such improvements vest: and gains and losses arising on settlements curtailments.
A credit in respect of the expected return on the schemes assets and a charge in respect of the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities because the benefits are one period closer to settlement are shown in the income statement as financing income pension schemes.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Defined benefit pension surpluses are recognised where scheme rules indicate that such surpluses are recoverable by the Group in the form of either an unconditional right to refund if the scheme were to be wound up or reductions in future contributions.
Share-based payments Employees including directors of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
Equity-settled transactions The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to all grants of equity instruments made after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the grant date of the equity instruments granted.
The fair value is determined by an external valuer using the Black Scholes or Monte Carlo methods as appropriate.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the periods in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described below.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
No expense or increase in equity is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, as appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions are estimates and the actual cost and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events.
Management reassesses the amounts of these provisions at each balance sheet date in order to ensure that they are measured at the current best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Any difference between the amounts previously recognised and the current estimates is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Further details are given in Note 23.
68 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued at 31 December 2008 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets A financial asset is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to pay.
Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and or purchased option including a cash-settled of similar provision on the transferred asset, the extent of the Groups continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option including a cash-settled option or similar provision on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the Groups continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as derecognition of the original liability and recognition of a new liability, and the difference between the carrying amounts of the original liability and the fair value of the new liability is recognised in the income statement.
Future changes in accounting policies The following IAS and IFRS have been issued but are not effective for the year ended 31 December 2008 and will impact the Groups financial statements upon adoption: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements revised which makes a number of changes to the presentation of the primary statements, including the requirement to present a new statement of comprehensive income which may be presented alongside a separate income statement as a separate primary statement or combined with the income statement as a single statement.
Whenever there is a restatement or reclassification, an additional balance sheet, as at the beginning of the earliest period presented, will be required to be published.
The revised standard becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The adoption will necessitate changes to the way in which the Group currently presents its financial statements: IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised which makes a number of significant changes to the treatment of acquisition costs and contingent consideration relating to an acquisition and provides an option the full goodwill method to recognise 100% of the goodwill of an acquired entity not just the acquiring entitys portion of the goodwill, with corresponding increases to goodwill and minority interests.
This revised standard becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and so the Group will apply it prospectively to all business combinations on or after 1 January 2010.
The impact of the revised standard is expected to lead to changes in the Groups accounting treatment of acquisition costs, which are currently included within goodwill, but will need to be expensed.
The standard will also require the Group to estimate contingent consideration at the date of acquisition and include that amount in the cost of acquisition and, hence, effect goodwill.
Any revisions to estimates of contingent consideration are currently reflected with a corresponding entry to goodwill.
However, on adoption of the revised standard, changes resulting from post-acquisition events, such as meeting revenue and earnings targets, will be recorded in the income statement: IFRS 8 Operating Segments which requires segmental disclosures that reflect the segments that management uses internally for evaluating the performance of operating segments and allocating resources to those segments.
This standard was issued in November 2006 and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The Group has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact on its disclosures of adopting IFRS 8.
There will be no impact on the Groups reported profit or net assets: The following IAS, IFRS and IFRICs have been issued but are not effective for the year ended 31 December 2008 and will not impact the Groups financial statements upon adoption: IAS 23 Borrowing Costs revised IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation amendments IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate amendment IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Eligible hedged items amendment IFRS 2 Share-based Payment amendment IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate IFRIC 16 Hedges of Net Investment in a Foreign Operation Improvements to IFRSs May 2008 69 3.
Segment information Business segments During the year, the Group reorganised its core operations significantly, replacing the historic divisional structure with a much flatter, market-focused organisation.
In February 2008, UBM Technology previously known as CMP Technology was reorganised into four separate market-focused businesses, followed by CMP Information into five businesses in June 2008 and Commonwealth Business Media into two businesses in December 2008.
Given the significant change during 2008, the Group has redefined its business segments, moving from the previous seven operating segments News Distribution, UBM Technology, CMP Information, CMPMedica, CMP Asia, Commonwealth Business Media and RISI to two segments, B2B Distribution, Monitoring and Targeting and B2B Communities.
These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The amounts shown for the year ended 31 December 2007 have been restated to reflect the new business segments.
For information purposes only, the results of the previous seven segments have been included for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Group has made changes to reallocate RISI from Corporate operations to the B2B Communities business segment.
The amounts shown for the year ended 31 December 2007 have been restated to reflect these reallocations.
The B2B Distribution, Monitoring and Targeting segment operates in the distribution, targeting and evaluation of company information.
The B2B Communities segment operates in the provision of events, business information, marketing services, directories, websites, magazines and trade press.
The following tables present the revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information for the Groups business segments for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.

In February, UBM Technology was reorganised into four separate market-focused businesses, followed by CMP Information into five businesses in June and Commonwealth Business Media into two businesses in December.
UBM also implemented a number of restructuring and reorganisation projects across the Group.
The objectives of these projects are to achieve greater alignment of product portfolios and organisational structure to the changing needs of customers, to better position the businesses to take advantage of higher growth areas and to improve profitability.

The exceptional charge of 6.2m includes 3.3m relating to redundancy, 2.2m relating to vacant property and 0.7m to restructuring and business reorganisation costs.

Taxation continued The amounts relating to current tax recognised in the balance sheet are: 2008 2007 m m Current tax liabilities 237.2 227.6 As previously disclosed, the Group is in dispute with HMRC with regards to a technical matter arising in relation to the sale of our Regional Newspapers business in 1998.
The tax in dispute is estimated at 80m.
The decision in the Court of Appeal went against the Group and the Group subsequently sought leave to appeal to the House of Lords which was denied.
The Group is currently discussing the basis of calculation of the capital gain with HMRC.
Whilst it is likely that the matter will not be resolved until 2010 it is possible that the matter could be resolved during the current year.
The Group continues to make a prudent assessment of the potential liability in its accounts for this and other matters and has recognised the full amount of tax in dispute as a liability in current tax liabilities.
Deferred tax Deferred tax at 31 December relates to the following: Consolidated Consolidated balance sheet income statement As restated 2007 2008 2008 2007 m m m m Deferred tax Fair value adjustments on acquisitions 33.4 29.6 6.4 5.2 Other temporary differences 1.8 1.2 0.2 0.5 35.2 30.8 6.2 5.7 At 31 December 2008, there was no recognised deferred tax liability for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Groups subsidiaries as the Group has determined that undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised amount in aggregate to 13.1bn 2007: 3.1bn.
There are no income tax consequences to the Group attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
As restated 2008 2007 m m The movement in the net deferred tax liability was as follows: Net liability at 1 January 30.8 30.2 Acquisition of subsidiaries see Note 29 3.0 5.4 Amounts credited to net profit 6.2 5.7 Currency translation 7.6 0.9 Net liability at 31 December 35.2 30.8 The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 80.1m relating to deductible temporary differences and 63.6m of which 50.6m will expire between 2018 and 2028 relating to unused tax losses 2007: 63.4m and 49.2m of which 35.2m will expire within 2018 and 2027 respectively.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these amounts due to the unpredictability of future taxable profit streams.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year reflecting the movements set out in Note 25.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year adjusted for the effects of dilutive options.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated on the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders, less amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, certain exceptional items, deferred tax on amortisation of intangible assets, taxation relating to exceptional items and net financing cost other than interest, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Certain exceptional items, net financing costs other than interest, taxation related to exceptional items and deferred tax on amortisation of intangible assets are excluded from this calculation, as due to their nature and the infrequency of the events giving rise to them, separate presentation allows shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance for the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better the trends of financial performance.

Pursuant to the Dividend Access Plan DAP arrangements put in place as part of the Scheme of Arrangement, shareholders in the Company are able to elect to receive their dividends from a UK source the DAP election.
Shareholders who held 50,000 or fewer shares i on the date of admission of the Companys shares to the London Stock Exchange and ii in the case of shareholders who did not own the shares at that time, on the first dividend record date after they become shareholders in the Company, unless they elect otherwise, will be deemed to have elected to receive their dividends under the DAP arrangements.
Shareholders who hold more than 50,000 shares and who wish to receive their dividends from a UK source must make a DAP election.
All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked.
Unless shareholders have made a DAP election, or are deemed to have made a DAP election, dividends will be received from an Irish source and will be taxed accordingly.

Management tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill might be impaired.
The Group generally uses fair value less costs to sell as the basis of its annual impairment review, with additional consideration being given to the value in use of each CGU.
Management does not re-compute the fair value less costs to sell of each CGU annually if all of the following criteria are met: The component assets and liabilities of the CGU have not changed since the last fair value calculation: The previous assessment of fair value less costs to sell exceeded the carrying amount of the CGU by a substantial margin: and Based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent recoverable amount calculation, the likelihood that a current fair value less costs to sell of the CGU would be less than its carrying value is remote.
Management have considered all of the above criteria in conjunction with the financial results for the CGUs in 2008 and the forecast results for 2009, along with consideration of the events that have taken place, and any changes to economic conditions that have occurred, since the previous goodwill impairment test.
Management consider that three CGUs CMP Asia, B2B Distribution, Monitoring and Targeting and RISI meet all three of the carry forward criteria, and the prior year calculation of the recoverable amount of these CGUs, based on fair value less costs to sell has been rolled forward for the purpose of the 2008 impairment test.
CMP Information also meets the carry forward criteria but has been valued as part of a periodic review process for the 2008 impairment test.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of a CGUs fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In calculating the fair value less costs to sell and value in use of its CGUs, management is assisted by the work of external advisors.
Fair value less costs to sell has been applied for UBM Technology, CMP Information and Commonwealth Business Media and value in use has been used as the recoverable amount for CMPMedica.
UBM Technology, CMP Information and Commonwealth Business Media The estimate of fair value less costs to sell is based on the best information available, and refers to the amount at which the CGU could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties.
The earnings multiple approach uses transaction revenue and EBITA multiples, obtained from comparable businesses and transactions in comparable businesses in the professional media sector.
A discount to the multiples from the peer group has been applied due to the smaller size of UBM Technology, CMP Information and Commonwealth Business Media compared to the peer group.
The calculation uses actual sales and EBITA results for 2008 and forecast sales and EBITA for 2009, based upon financial budgets approved by management.
Costs to sell are estimated to be 3% of the value of a CGU which is based on experience of prior disposals by the Group.
In the determination of fair value less costs to sell, the calculation of fair value is most sensitive to the precedent transaction multiples used.
During the year ended 31 December 2008, the deterioration in the economic climate and fall in equity markets has resulted in lower sales and EBITA multiples across the Group.
Management has conducted a sensitivity analysis in relation to multiples used in the impairment test.
For UBM Technology and CMP Information, if there is a further reasonably possible decline in multiples of companies in the professional media sector of 20% to 25%, the sensitivity analysis shows that the recoverable amount would continue to exceed the carrying value of the CGUs.
The fair value for Commonwealth Business Media, which was acquired in 2006, exceeds its carrying value by approximately 15m.
A reasonably possible decline in multiples could reduce the fair value less costs to sell of the Commonwealth Business Media CGU to a level comparable with its carrying value.
84 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued at 31 December 2008 12.
Goodwill continued CMPMedica The recoverable amount for the CMPMedica CGU was determined using value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects managements estimate of the CGUs weighted average cost of capital.
The value in use calculation for CMPMedica used cash flow information based on financial projections approved by management covering a five-year period.
The key assumptions used by management in the value in use calculations which are considered to be most sensitive to the calculation were: Forecast EBITA Forecast EBITA is based upon the financial projections approved by management covering a five-year period.
The projections have been determined by using a combination of long term trends, industry forecasts and management estimates.
Managements estimates and long term trends reflect the following factors: The continued rebalancing of the portfolio, away from print to digital and face-to-face media.
Within CMPMedica, digital revenue, as a proportion of total revenue has increased from approximately 1% in 2005 to approximately 8% in 2008.
This trend is expected to continue during the forecast period, with the continued development of digital products being part of managements core strategy.
Margin improvements due to restructuring and business reorganisation plans, that commenced in the latter part of 2007 and latter part of 2008.
Both restructuring programmes aim to rebalance the product portfolios to better meet the future needs of customers and audiences and ensure the support platforms are cost efficient.
This was undertaken by a combination of cost reductions and investment in organic product development and acquisitions.
The cost reductions and continued shift in portfolio mix, away from the lower margin print business towards face-to-face media and digital product offerings has contributed to the margin improvement seen in 2008, which has increased from 11.4% in 2007 to 16.0% in 2008.
The EBITA projection takes into account this improvement in margin.
1 Industry forecasts predict that the business information market will grow at a compound average growth rate of 5.4% between 2008 and 2011.
Management have considered this growth rate in their calculation of the five year EBITA forecast, together with exceptions specific to the healthcare business information industry.
A reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used to determine the EBITA five year projection could result in an impairment in the CMPMedica CGU, as its computed value in use currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately 50m.
For example, if print advertising spend declines at a greater rate than forecast and this decline is not offset by growth in digital and events, it would result in lower EBITA than was included in the CMPMedica value in use calculations and would bring the recoverable amount closer to the carrying value of the CGU.
Discount rate The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate for 20 year government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities.
The risk premium adjustment is assessed for factors specific to CMPMedica and reflects the countries that the CGU operates in.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 11.5%.
An increase in discount rate of approximately 2 percentage points would result in CMPMedicas recoverable amount reducing to a level comparable with its carrying value.
1 Source: Market Size, Share & Forecast Report, Outsell 2008 Information Industry.
Perpetuity growth rates The cash flows subsequent to the approved budget period are based upon the long-term historic growth rates of the underlying territories in which the CMPMedica CGU operates.
The perpetuity growth rate used was 2.3%, which is consistent with appropriate external sourced data for the relevant markets.
A reduction in perpetuity growth rate by approximately 2 percentage points would result in CMPMedicas recoverable amount reducing to a level comparable with its carrying value.
All other intangible asset captions are intangible assets arising on acquisitions and the associated amortisation charge is included in a separate line item in the income statement since these charges do not form part of adjusted Group operating profit.
The average remaining useful lives for the brands and customer contracts and relationships intangible assets is seven years and four years respectively.
The average remaining useful lives for the other classes of intangible assets is six years.

Market values have been used to calculate the value of the $5.7m of 7.75% US bonds.
The fair value of derivatives is calculated by the external counterparties to the contracts and verified using present value of future cash flows implied by the forward curve.
The fair value of cash at bank and deposits approximates to their book value due to their short maturity.
For all other financial assets and liabilities the carrying amount has been used.
Hedges Cash flow hedges 2008 2007 m m Interest rate swaps derivative financial assets 4.3 Interest rate swaps derivative financial liabilities 7.9 0.2 Forward currency contracts 7.9 4.1 Interest rate swaps At 31 December 2008, the Group held six interest rate swap contracts designated as hedges of expected payments under $300m of borrowing from the Groups 325m variable rate multi-option facility.
Under three of the swap contracts totalling $150m the Group will receive three month US dollar LIBOR and pay an average rate of 2.91% until January 2011.
Under a further three swap contracts totalling $150m the Group will receive six month US dollar LIBOR and pay an average rate of 3.34% until July 2012.
The Group also held an interest rate swap contract designated as a hedge of expected payments under 2,100m of borrowing from the Groups 325m variable rate multi option facility.
Under this swap contract, the Group will receive three month yen LIBOR and pay 1.13% until March 2010.
These hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 31 December 2008 with the ineffective portion of the hedging contracts transferred to financing cost other than interest.
At 31 December 2007, the Group held five interest rate swap contracts designated as hedges of expected payments under 145m of borrowing from the Groups variable rate multi-option facility.
The swap contracts mature in May 2010.
These hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 31 December 2007 with the ineffective portion of the hedging contracts transferred to financing cost other than interest.

Financial instruments continued Forward currency contracts At 31 December 2008, the Group had three forward currency hedging contracts designated as hedges of 0.3m of sterling equivalent customer receipts in euro, US dollar and South African rand.
These hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 31 December 2008.
The fair value of these derivatives at 31 December 2008 was less than 0.1m.
At 31 December 2007, the Group held three contracts designated as hedges of $1.2m expected future customer US dollar receipts in a subsidiary undertaking with a sterling functional currency.
The forward currency contracts, which mature at various points before the end of February 2008 are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the firm commitments and have been negotiated to match the terms of those commitments.
These hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 31 December 2007.
The fair value of these derivatives at 31 December 2007 was less than 0.1m.
Net investment in foreign operations Included in borrowings at 31 December 2008 was a borrowing of $380m 2007: $150m with a fair value of $368.5m 2007: no relevant interest rate swaps including the value of the interest rate swaps discussed above, which has been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United States operations within the Groups UBM Technology and Commonwealth Business Media businesses, and is being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Included in borrowings at 31 December 2008 was a borrowing of 2,900m 2007: 3,100m with a fair value of 2,884.1m 2007: 3,092.0m of which 1,900m 2007: 1,500m has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in the Japanese subsidiary CMP Japan and is being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on this investment.
Included in borrowings at 31 December 2007 was a borrowing of 145.0m with a fair value of 150.6m including the value of the interest rate swaps discussed above, which has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in the European operations within the Groups CMPMedica business, and is being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
At 31 December 2008, the Group held two forward currency contracts designated as hedges of $43m of net investment in the United States operations within the Groups PR Newswire business.
Upon maturity of these forward exchange contracts in January 2009 the Group will receive 26.4m and pay $43.0m.
These forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of these borrowings and the mark to market of the forward currency contracts are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investment in these subsidiaries.
These hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 31 December 2008 and 2007.

Financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
The Group manages its credit risk in relation to its operating activities trade receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions and other financial instruments.
Credit risk related to financial instruments and cash deposits: The following financial instruments and cash deposits are exposed to credit risk: 2008 2007 m m Cash at bank and in hand 33.3 35.5 Short term deposits 138.9 59.5 Interest rate swaps 4.3 172.2 99.3 The Group only deposits surplus cash with major banks of high quality credit standing.
The Group only enters into derivative contracts with major banks of high quality credit standing.
Trade receivables Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Groups established policy, procedures and controls relating to customer credit management.
Credit limits are established for all customers and are based inter alia on bank references and credit checks.
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
The maximum credit risk associated with the Groups trade receivables is equal to their carrying value as set out in Note 18.
Foreign currency risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities and forward currency contracts and the Groups equity due to changes in the fair value of forward currency hedges and net investment hedges.

The amounts transferred represented 9.7m in respect of future obligations for vacant property and 22.0m in respect of disposals made in prior years.
Liabilities for reorganisation and restructuring As discussed in Note 7, during 2008 the Group implemented a number of restructuring and reorganisation projects.
With the exception of amounts relating to vacant properties see liabilities on properties below, the provision is expected to be substantially utilised within one year.
Liabilities on properties The Group has lease obligations in respect of the continuing costs of vacant property, the quantification of which depends upon the ability to exit the leases early or sublet the properties, and for dilapidations on certain leasehold properties which are dependent principally on actual reinstatement costs on expiry of the leases.
The provision in respect of these obligations at 31 December 2008 has been determined following external professional advice and will be utilised over the period of the leases in question, which range from one to five years.
The provision is discounted at an appropriate cost of capital.
The amounts discussed under liabilities for reorganisation and restructuring relating to vacant property have been included within liabilities on property.
Liabilities arising from former financial services activities A subsidiary of the Group was formerly engaged in the selling of personal pensions prior to 1996.
As a result of the industry-wide review into pension misselling by the Personal Investment Authority, the Group is exposed to actual and potential future claims by investors in respect of policies found to have been mis-sold.
Although work continues to progress with respect to the identification and review of all pension policies sold, the number and amount of such claims cannot be finally determined until all potential compensation costs have been agreed.
The amount of the provisions at 31 December 2008 has been determined on the basis of independent financial advice.
Disposal provisions The Group has made a number of disposals of businesses in prior years.
Warranty and other claims may be brought against the Group in relation to these disposed businesses generally over periods of up to seven years after the date of disposal.
The provision in respect of these items has been determined based upon the contract terms of each disposal and are reassessed on an annual basis over the period during which claims may be brought against the Group.
98 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued at 31 December 2008 24.
Retirement benefit obligation The Group operates a number of funded defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas.
The charge for the year in relation to defined contribution schemes was 4.7m 2007: 4.6m.
The defined benefit pension schemes included in the following disclosures are i UK schemes, being the United Pension Plan, the United Magazines Final Salary Scheme, the defined benefit section of the United Group Pension Scheme, The Builder Group Pension Scheme which was transferred to the UGPS during the year, the United News Executive Pension Scheme, the OAG Pension Scheme, and ii US schemes, being the CMP Media LLC Cash Balance Retirement Plan and the CMP Post Retirement Medical Plan.
The most recent actuarial funding valuations for the majority of the UK scheme liabilities were carried out in 2008 and updated to 31 December 2008 by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: Other As restated Other As restated UK Schemes Schemes Total UK Schemes Schemes Total 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 m m m m m m Fair value of plan assets 382.1 23.2 405.3 455.9 24.9 480.8 Benefit obligation 335.6 38.8 374.4 415.6 29.0 444.6 Irrecoverable element of pension surplus 16.3 16.3 14.1 14.1 Asset liability in the balance sheet 30.2 15.6 14.6 26.2 4.1 22.1 Any surplus on the UK schemes ultimately repaid by the Trustees would currently be subject to a 35% tax charge prior to being repaid.
IFRIC 14 requires a surplus to be reduced by recognition of this tax at the relevant balance sheet date.
The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: Other Other UK Schemes Schemes Total UK Schemes Schemes Total 2008 2007 2008 2008 2007 2007 m m m m m m Current service cost 1.2 2.0 3.2 1.1 2.1 3.2 Past service cost 0.5 0.5 Curtailments 2.1 2.1 0.3 0.3 Settlement 0.1 0.1 1.7 0.1 1.6 0.8 2.2 3.0 Interest cost 23.5 1.8 25.3 22.5 1.4 23.9 Expected return on plan assets 27.8 1.9 29.7 26.5 1.9 28.4 4.3 0.1 4.4 4.0 0.5 4.5 Total pension credit charge 2.6 0.2 2.8 3.2 1.7 1.5 Of the total pension credit charge, a 1.6m charge and a 4.4m credit 2007: 3.0m charge and 4.5m credit were included in Operating expenses and Financing income pension schemes respectively.
The main UK schemes are closed to new members, hence under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost expressed as a percentage of the salaries of the remaining members will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
In March 2006, the Group agreed to make special contributions to the UK pension schemes over the next ten years of 1.7m per annum and to arrange letters of credit to be issued to the scheme trustees from one or more of the Companys bankers to make up the difference between the valuation and 100% while this funding takes effect.
The value of the letters of credit issued to the scheme trustees in 2008 is 26.0m.
The main conditions under which these letters of credit could be drawn relate to events which would imperil the interests of the scheme, such as insolvency, or the Group failing to make agreed payments.
Additional pension contributions of 1.7m 2007: 1.7m were made to the UK schemes during the year and nil 2007: nil were made to other schemes during the year.
The total service cost for 2009 is currently expected to be 1.5m 2008: 4.0m.
A significant reduction in service cost is expected in 2009 due to the closure of the CMP Media LLC Cash Balance Retirement Plan with effect from 1 January 2009.
Retirement benefit obligation continued The movement in the asset liability recognised in the balance sheet is as follows: Other Other UK Schemes Schemes Total UK Schemes Schemes Total 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 m m m m m m At 1 January 26.2 4.1 22.1 0.2 3.6 3.8 Total income expenses recognised in the income statement 2.6 0.2 2.8 3.2 1.7 1.5 Net actuarial gains losses recognised in the year 1.5 10.8 9.3 34.3 0.5 34.8 Irrecoverable element of pension surplus 2.2 2.2 14.1 14.1 Contributions paid by UBM 2.1 2.0 4.1 3.0 1.0 4.0 Currency translation 2.9 2.9 0.3 0.3 At 31 December 30.2 15.6 14.6 26.2 4.1 22.1 The principal actuarial assumptions used in determining pension obligations for the Groups plan are shown below: Other Other UK Schemes Schemes UK Schemes Schemes 2008 2008 2007 2007 % % % % Discount rate 6.70 5.55 5.80 5.67 Expected return on plan assets 6.79 7.41 6.44 7.44 Future salary increases 3.75 3.41 3.75 3.39 Future LPI 5% cap pension increases 2.50 n a 3.10 n a Inflation assumption 2.50 2.47 3.10 2.48 Taking account of the work undertaken in connection with the actuarial valuations in 2008, the mortality assumptions used at 31 December 2008 for UK schemes have been updated to better reflect scheme experience.
The death rates used are 130% of the 2000 series standard tables based on the year of birth of scheme members, which is currently on average 1935 for pensioners and 1957 for non-pensioners.
Allowances for future reductions in death rates are assumed to be in line with the medium cohort standard actuarial projection.
These projections allow for life expectancy to improve over time due to improvements in medical treatments and other lifestyle factors such that younger members who have not yet reached pensionable age are expected to live longer than current pensioner members.
In 2007, for UK schemes, the 1992 series standard tables were used.
The assumed average life expectancy of current pensioner members at age 65 is 19.0 years for males and 21.4 years for females 2007: 19.2 years and 22.3 years respectively.
For current non-pensioner members who have not yet reached pensionable age, the assumed average life expectancy when they reach age 65 is 20.6 for males and 22.9 for females 2007: 20.6 years and 23.6 years respectively.
The average rate of improvement underlying the standard tables is approximately an increase of 0.7 years life expectancy in every ten years.
For the valuation of US scheme liabilities, RP 2000 tables are used in both years for all members.
The life expectancy for a 65-year-old male is 18.8 years and a 65-year-old female is 20.8 years.
Additional assumptions used for valuing the UK scheme liabilities are an allowance for between 6680% of non-pensioners to exchange 32% of pension for tax-free cash on retirement, which is consistent with the assumption used for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Plan assets mainly consist of equity instruments and fixed income investments.
The expected rate of return on equities at 31 December 2008 is based on an expected long term out-performance of equities over government bonds of 5.5% p. a.
The assumed discount rate, salary increases and mortality all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.

Share capital continued Capital reorganisation and new holding company On 1 July 2008, as part of a reorganisation of the corporate structure of the Group, United Business Media Limited UBML was created as a new holding company and parent company of the Group.
Immediately following the Scheme, the former shareholders of UBM plc held the same economic interest in United Business Media Limited as they held in UBM plc immediately prior to its implementation.
The effect of the Scheme was to increase share premium by 885.4m from 362.2m at the date immediately preceding the scheme, eliminate UBM plcs capital redemption reserve of 52.1m and create a merger reserve with a negative debit balance of 833.3m.
Also on 1 July 2008, UBM plc reduced and repaid its entire issued B share capital for total consideration of 9.4m being 245p per share plus the relevant proportion of dividends outstanding.
The effect of the reduction and repayment of UBM plcs B share capital of 9.4m was to reduce share capital by 0.3m, increase the capital redemption reserve by 0.3m, reduce retained earnings by 9.3m in relation to the redemption of the B shares and to record the 0.1m B share dividend for the period to the redemption date.
71 On 4 July 2008, the Jersey Court approved the reduction of capital of UBML, whereby the nominal value of each ordinary share was reduced from 33 88p to 10p and the balance of UBMLs share premium account was transferred to the profit and loss reserve.
The effect of the reduction of capital was to reduce share capital by 58.1m, reduce share premium by 1,247.6m and increase the profit and loss reserve by 1,305.7m.
Share repurchases The Group did not repurchase and cancel any of its own ordinary shares during the year 2007: 10,727,793 ordinary shares at an average price of 705.8p.
The total amount paid to acquire the ordinary shares was nil and, as described above, 9.4m was paid to acquire B shares 2007: 75.9m for ordinary shares and 0.8m for B shares.
Ordinary shares On 19 March 2007, in conjunction with the special dividend of 72.0p per share, a share consolidation was carried out to convert 49 existing ordinary shares 5 71 with a nominal value of 30 14p each to 44 new ordinary shares with a nominal value of 33 88p each.
The share consolidation converted the 281,591,877 existing issued and fully paid ordinary shares into 252,858,012 new issued and fully paid ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of earnings per share reflects the share consolidation refer to Note 10.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than: Certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations for example, insider trading laws and market requirements relating to close periods : and Pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority whereby certain employees of the Company require the approval of the Company to deal in the Companys securities.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
B shares The return of capital to shareholders undertaken in 2001 took the form of a subdivision and consolidation of the existing Company ordinary shares.
23 On 23 April 2001, each of the existing 507,901,885 ordinary shares of 25p then in issue were sub-divided into one share of 8 p B Shares and one share 44 21 21 25 25 of 16 44p and immediately following such sub-division every issued share of 16 44p was sub-divided into 29 shares of 44p.
Every 44 shares of 44p each resulting from such sub-division were then consolidated into one ordinary share of 25p.
The subdivision created a class of B shares with a total value of approximately 1.25bn.
UK shareholders had the option to sell these shares back to the Company for 245p per share, to receive a single dividend of 245p per share, or to retain the B shares and receive a continuing dividend linked to LIBOR.
During the year ended 31 December 2008, as described above, 3,809,932 B shares were purchased by the Company for consideration of 9.4m.
Cumulatively to 1 July 2008, 375,417,690 B shares had been purchased by United Business Media plc for consideration of 919.8m.
At 31 December 2008, no B shares remain in issue 31 December 2007: 3,809,932 B shares.
B shareholders were entitled to a non-cumulative preference dividend.
On winding up, the B shareholders were entitled to 245p per share and the relevant proportion of the dividends outstanding.
B shareholders did not have any voting entitlements except in a resolution relating to a winding up of the company or if the B share dividend has been outstanding for more than six months.
Company share schemes The ESOP Trust and QUEST Trust see Note 27 own 0.91% 2007: 1.07% of the issued share capital of the Company in trust for the benefit of employees of the Group and their dependants.
The voting rights in relation to these shares are exercised by the trustees.

Share-based payments The Group has an Employee Share Ownership Plan the ESOP.
The ESOP has purchased in the open market Company shares which are held on trust for employees participating in the plans listed below.
The purchase of shares in the open market is financed through contributions in cash by the Company and, for awards under the Bonus Investment Plan, through bonuses sacrificed by senior executives.
The Group also has a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust the QUEST, which is a discretionary trust for the benefit of UK employees including executive directors of the Group in connection with the exercise of SAYE options.
The Group maintains seven share-based payment arrangements: 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme, 2000 Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan, UK Save As You Earn Option Scheme, International Save As You Earn Scheme, Medium Term Incentive Plan, Performance Share Plan and Bonus Investment Plan.
As at 31 December the holdings over the ESOP and the QUEST were as follows: Number Number of shares of shares 2008 2007 ESOP Ordinary shares 2,212,815 2,713,430 QUEST Ordinary shares 11,364 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme On 18 April 2000 the Group established a share option programme for full-time directors and certain employees.
All participants in the 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme the Executive scheme must be employed by United Business Media Limited or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the options.
The number of options granted to a participant under the Executive scheme is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, being the committee established by the Board of Directors as such.
The number of ordinary shares which may be placed under option under the Executive scheme in any year may not be more than 25,264,262 shares being 5% of the ordinary share capital on issue at the date of establishment of the Executive scheme.
The exercise price to be paid by a participant when exercising options granted will be determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The price shall not be lower than the closing middle market price of shares of that class as listed on the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List on the day prior to the grant date or the average closing middle market price of shares of that class on the three days prior to the grant date if so decided by the Remuneration Committee.
Options may be exercised after the third anniversary of the grant date subject to satisfactory completion of performance conditions.
Options must normally be exercised before the expiry of ten years from the date of the grant.
Options may be exercised earlier in the event of death.
Share options outstanding at the end of the year have the following exercise prices: 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average average average average exercise price remaining life Number exercise price remaining life Number p years of shares p years of shares Exercise price p 247.3 277.2 258.4 4.0 337,000 257.8 5.1355,000 449.3 574.0 526.2 7.5 4,502,713 542.0 6.82,866,557 724.8 867.2 770.6 3.0 1,106,211 770.5 4.31,228,711 104 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued at 31 December 2008 27.
Share-based payments continued 2000 Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan On 18 April 2000 the Group established a share option programme for certain directors and employees.
All participants in the 2000 Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan SEEPP must be employed by United Business Media Limited or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the options.
Shares are purchased on the open market and financed through bonuses sacrificed by senior executives the Bonus Option under the terms of SEEPP.
The number of options granted to a participant under SEEPP is dependent on the level of the annual bonus awarded.
The Remuneration Committee may then exercise its discretion to grant an equal number of shares the Matching Option as granted under the Bonus Option.
The number of ordinary shares which may be placed under option under SEEPP in any year may not be more than 50,528,525 shares, being 10% of the ordinary share capital on issue at the date of establishment of the plan.
There is no monetary consideration payable for the options granted under the plan to directors and employees, these are granted by Deed only.
The Remuneration Committee is also able to grant shares or options to the Trustees of the ESOP.
If shares of the class issued are listed on the London Stock Exchange, the exercise price shall not be lower than the closing middle market price of shares of that class as listed on the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List on the day prior to the date that the options are granted or on the date of issue of shares.
Options may be exercised after the fourth anniversary of the grant date subject to satisfactory completion of performance conditions.
One-third of Matching options vest subject to adjusted earnings per share EPS see Note 10 growth exceeding retail price index RPI growth plus 3%: one-third of options vest subject to adjusted EPS growth exceeding RPI growth plus 5% per annum over four years: the final third is not subject to performance criteria.
Share options outstanding at the end of the year were 0.2m which have an exercise price of nil, and an average weighted remaining life of five years.
The SEEPP has now been closed and no further grants will be made under the scheme.
Save As You Earn Option Schemes On 6 May 2004, the Group established the Sharesave Scheme SAYE for Directors and certain employees.
Under these schemes all participants in the SAYE scheme must be employed by United Business Media Limited or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the options.
The number of options granted to a participant under the SAYE scheme is at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
The number of ordinary shares which may be placed under option under the SAYE scheme in any year may not be more than 10% of the ordinary share capital on issue at the time of granting options.
The exercise price to be paid by a participant when exercising options granted will be determined by the Directors and shall not be less than the greater of 80% of market value of the shares at the date of invitation to enter the SAYE scheme or the nominal value of unissued shares.
Options may be exercised after either the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the grant date in accordance with each employees Savings Contract.
Options must normally be exercised within six months of the date the options are exercisable or within 12 months in the case of death.
Options may be exercised earlier in the event of death, or ceasing to be employed due to retirement, injury, disability or, at the absolute discretion of the Board, redundancy.
Share options outstanding at the end of the year have the following exercise prices: 2008 2008 2007 2007 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average average 2008 average average 2007 exercise price remaining life Number exercise price remaining life Number Exercise price p p years of shares p years of shares 160.5 160.5 1.9 33,180 160.5 1.3257,638 412.3 497.2 418.4 3.1 1,011,424 460.9 2.4338,822 640.1 640.1 2.3 241,354 640.1 3.4550,224 Medium Term Incentive Plan Medium Term Incentive Plan MTIP participants must be employed by United Business Media Limited or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the options.
The number of options granted to a participant under the MTIP is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Only market-purchased shares may be used for awards under the MTIP.
The value of the MTIP award is based on a percentage of salary as determined by the Remuneration Committee each year, following assessment of the employee company performance over the prior financial year the performance year.
The number granted is based on dividing the value of the award by the average share price in December preceding the performance year.
There is no monetary consideration payable for the options granted and shares subsequently acquired under the plan to directors and employees, these are granted by Deed only.
Options may be exercised in two stages: 50% of options may be exercised in January of the second financial year after the year in which they were granted: the remaining 50% may be exercised in January of the third financial year after the options were granted.
Options may only be granted subject to satisfactory completion of performance conditions.
Options must normally be exercised before the expiry of seven years from the date of the grant.
Options may be exercised earlier in the event of death or ceasing to be employed due to retirement, injury, disability or redundancy.
The exercise price of the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2008 is nil 2007: nil, and the weighted average life of the share options is four years.
Share-based payments continued Performance Share Plan In 2005 the Group established an incentive plan for full-time directors and senior executives.
All participants in the Performance Share Plan PSP must be employed by United Business Media Limited or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the awards.
The value of awards granted to a participant under the PSP is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, but may not exceed 1.5 times base salary, save that in exceptional circumstances awards of up to two times base salary may be made.
During 2007 and 2006 grants were made under the PSP to full-time directors and senior executives, which requires United Business Medias total shareholder return TSR to outperform a comparator group of companies over a three year period.
25% of the award will vest if TSR is at median position subject to a maximum value of 25% of base salary and 100% if TSR is in the top decile.
In between these positions, the award will vest on a straight line basis.
During 2007 and 2006 grants were also made under the PSP to certain employees, excluding full-time directors and senior executives and in place of grants under the 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme, which requires UBMs adjusted earnings per share EPS to grow by at least 7% per annum above UK inflation over a three year period.
A lower proportion of the shares shall vest provided adjusted EPS grows by over 3% per annum above UK inflation over the period.
The awards are made in the form of options exercisable on payment of a nominal value of 1.
The number of ordinary shares over which an award is made is calculated by dividing the monetary value of the award by the price of UBM ordinary shares at the time of grant.
The number of ordinary shares over which awards may be granted under the Performance Plan may not result in more than 10% of the ordinary share capital being issued or issuable under the companys incentive plans in any ten year period.
It is expected that market purchased shares will generally be used to satisfy awards under the PSP.
Bonus Investment Plan On 26 September 2005 the Group established the Bonus Investment Plan BIP, which replaced the SEEPP.
This enables participants to defer part of their annual bonus into United Business Media Limited ordinary shares and provides the opportunity to earn further shares.
25% of any annual bonus award will be automatically deferred into shares to be held for three years, and the participant may also elect to defer up to a further 25% into shares for the same period.
At the end of three years if the employee remains in service with the Company then the participant could receive a matching award of up to two additional shares for every share held if the Companys adjusted earnings per share have grown by more than an average of at least 7% per annum above UK retail price index growth over the three year period.
A lower ratio of matching shares may be earned if earnings per share have grown by more than 3% per annum above UK retail price index growth.
Awards are made in the form of options which are exercisable on payment of a nominal 1.
The number of ordinary shares which may be placed under option under the BIP depends on the monetary value of the bonus awarded to an employee during the year.
The amount of bonus depends upon employee company performance over the prior financial year the year of performance measurement.
For the element which is mandatorily paid in shares, the number is calculated by dividing 25% of the monetary value of the bonus by the average December share price in the year preceding the year of performance measurement.
For any further element which the employee elects to defer into shares, the number is calculated by dividing the relevant monetary value by the share price at the time of the award.
Options, once vested, must normally be exercised before the expiry of ten years from the date of grant.
Options may be exercised earlier in the event of death, or ceasing to be employed due to retirement, injury, disability or redundancy.
Awards outstanding at the end of the year expiring on 13 March 2016, 7 March 2017 and 20 March 2018 were 0.5m 2007: 0.5m, 0.4m 2007: 0.5m and 0.5m 2007: nil respectively.

Share-based payments continued Valuation of share-based payments Options granted under the 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme and the SAYE plan were valued using the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo option-pricing models.
Nil cost options and restricted shares excluding the PSP awards with TSR-based performance conditions were valued based on the share price at grant date less the value of any dividends foregone during the period to exercise.
The following table provides the weighted averages of the assumptions used to value options granted during the year ended 31 December 2008: 2008 2007 Dividend yield 4.5% 3.5% Expected volatility 20.0% 20.0% Risk-free rate 3.8% 5.3% Forfeiture assumptions % per year : All plans excluding SAYE 5.0% 5.0% SAYE 10.0% 10.0% Weighted average share price at grant date: Options 526p 800p Nil cost options share awards without TSR condition 600p 737p Nil cost options share awards with TSR condition 511p 782p Weighted average fair value at grant date: Options 81p 223p Nil cost options share awards without TSR condition 540p 655p Nil cost options share awards with TSR condition 181p 414p Expected life Equal to vesting period Equal to vesting period The expected volatility is based on a forward looking long term management view.
A Monte Carlo simulation model was used for valuing PSP awards which have a performance condition based on the ranking of UBM TSR growth relative to a group of media-related comparator companies.
The additional assumptions made for this purpose are that the average correlation of TSR growth between companies is 19% 2007: 19% and the average of the individual volatility assumptions used for each comparator company is 30% 2007: 25%.
The total charge for the year relating to the employee sharebased payment plans was 8.4m 2007: 7.5m.
Of this amount, 7.9m 2007: 6.9m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
The remaining 0.5m 2007: 0.6m relates to that 25% of cash bonus earned over 2008 which may be deferred for shares under the BIP at the option of the employee, which is treated as cash-settled liability at 31 December 2008 until the actual deferral amount is known.
At 31 December 2008, the cash-settled liability was 0.5m 2007: 0.6m.
The total charge for the year includes an amount in relation to 0.7 million nil cost MTIP and BIP options that it is expected may be issued in 2009 based on services provided and performance over 2008.
The weighted average fair value for these awards is 487p and the awards are expensed over four years starting in January 2008.
