1 The amounts for 2004 are stated on the basis of UK GAAP because it is not practical to restate amounts for periods prior to the date of transition to IFRS.
The principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRSs were discussed in note 37 to the 2006 Group financial statements.
2 Dividends per share have been presented on a paid basis in line with IFRS.
