Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share ownership trust ESOT.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group now has a single class of instruments dilutive to ordinary shares: employee share options.

Financial instrument risk management objectives and policy The Group has identified exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk Capital risk The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or valuations.
The Groups exposure to market risk is restricted to that of interest rate changes on its borrowings.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps, collars and hedges to generate the desired interest and risk profile.
The Groups policy is to fix or cap interest rates on at least 50% of its borrowings.
At 31 March 2008 62% 2007: 60% of Group borrowings were fixed or hedged through the use of interest rate hedges and collars.
All transactions entered into are approved by the Board and in accordance with the Groups treasury policy.
The Board also monitor variances on interest rates to budget and forecast rates to ensure that the risk relating to interest rates is being sufficiently safeguarded against.
Sensitivity analysis The following analysis required by IFRS 7 is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group's financial performance to reasonable changes in interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared by reviewing year end loan balances and the interest rates applied on these balances at the end of both financial years, adjusting for a reasonable variation in rates based on internal management information.
The following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in interest rates, before the effects of taxation.
2008 2007 Income Income statement Equity statement Equity - m - m - m - m UK interest rate - 1.0% 3.0 3.0 3.6 3.6 b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups exposure to this risk principally relates to receivables from tenants.
The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the characteristics of individual tenants occupying its rental properties.
The Group has nearly 4,500 tenants in over 106 properties generating net rental income.
The largest single tenant generates less than 0.6% of net rental income.
As such, the credit risk attributable to individual tenants is low.
Monitoring of bad debts and any potential bad debts occurs every month with information being reported to Board level for monitoring as part of the monthly performance monitoring process.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk from its customers as exposure is spread over a large number of entities.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: 2008 2007 m m Cash and cash equivalents note 14 2.5 2.4 Trade receivables 5.4 3.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss 0.1 7.9 5.6 Workspace Group PLC 74 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 18.
Financial instrument risk management objectives and policy continued As at 31 March 2008, the ageing of trade receivables was as follows: Total Impairment Unimpaired Total Impairment Unimpaired 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 m m m m m m Up to 3 months past due 4.3 4.3 2.5 2.5 3 to 6 months past due 0.6 0.1 0.5 0.2 0.1 0.1 Over 6 months past due 0.5 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.2 0.2 5.4 0.3 5.1 3.1 0.3 2.8 The trade receivables balance is deemed to be all past due as rental payments are due on demand.
Trade receivables that are not impaired are expected to be fully recovered as there is no recent history of default or indications that debtors will not meet their obligations.
Impaired receivables have been fully provided against see note 13. c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure it will always have sufficient funds to meet obligations as they fall due.
This is performed via a variety of methods including regular cash flow review and forecasting, monitoring the maturity profile of debt and the regular revision of borrowing facilities.
The Group maintains the following lines of credit to ensure it can effectively manage its liquidity risk: an overdraft facility of 4m available on demand and headroom on loan balances at 31 March 2008 of 60.6m 31 March 2007: 65.4m that can be drawn down to meet short-term financing needs.
Cashflow is monitored formally on a monthly basis as part of internal performance monitoring with regular daily monitoring and forecasting undertaken to manage day-to-day cash flow.
The Board reviews compliance with loan covenants which include agreed interest cover ratios, alongside a review of available headroom on loan facilities.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities existing at the balance sheet date.
Interest payments are based upon the loan balances and applicable interest rates payable on these at each year end.

Capital risk management is a key area for the Group, and the Board aim to maintain a strong capital base to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to further grow and develop the business.
The Group's policy is to borrow using a mixture of short and long-term loans and cash from operations.
The Board regularly monitors shareholders return on capital and NAV and has specific measures which are monitored each month as part of the normal performance review process.

An appropriate provision under current tax law has been made for this liability.

The Group operates an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and a Save as You Earn SAYE share option scheme.
Grants under ESOS are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant and normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Grants under the SAYE scheme are normally exercisable after three or five years saving.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the SAYE schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
At 31 March 2008 there were 4,797,855 2007: 4,926,053 share options exercisable on the Companys ordinary share capital.
Of these 3,310,526 were current and retired directors share options and are disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report.

The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The expected dividend yield is based on the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.

The scheme and its performance criteria are fully explained in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 50. iv Fair value of Co-Investment Plan share based payments The Monte Carlo model has been used to determine fair value of Co-Investment Plan grants.
Assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2008 2007 Share price at grant pence 405p 345p Exercise price pence Nil Nil Average expected life years 3 3 Risk free rate 5% 5% Expected dividend yield 1% 1% Average share price volatility FTSE Real Estate comparator group market related performance condition assumption 23% 23% Average correlation FTSE Real Estate comparator group market related performance condition assumption 80% 80% Fair value per option 188p 165p The expected Workspace share price volatility was determined by taking account of the daily share price movement over a five year period.
The respective FTSE 250 Real Estate share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the same periods.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions and historical experience.
The risk free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.
