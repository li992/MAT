Banks loans include a ZAR7.2 billion loan held by Vodafone Holdings SA Pty Limited VHSA, which directly and indirectly owns the Groups 50% interest in Vodacom Group Pty Limited.
VHSA has pledged its 100% equity shareholding in Vodafone Investments SA VISA as security for its loan obligations.

An arrangement has been put in place where the Vodacom Group Pty Limited shares held by VHSA and VTISA are held in an escrow account to ensure the shares cannot be sold to satisfy the pledge made by both companies.
