Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 16.
Deferred tax asset continued At the balance sheet date, the group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of unused tax losses of $97.0 million 2007: $89.2 million available for offset against future profits against which no deferred tax asset has been recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
These losses expire at various dates from 2018 through 2027.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are immaterial.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.
No interest has been charged by suppliers in respect of overdue amounts in either year.
The directors estimate the fair value of the loan to be the same as the amounts shown above.
The loan is subject to certain financial and other covenants which have all been met during the year.
The loan is covered by a guarantee from Autonomy Corporation plc but is not secured against any assets of the group.
The remaining amounts were paid during 2008 and the provision fully utilized in that period.
