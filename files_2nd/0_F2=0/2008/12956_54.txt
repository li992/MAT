FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT In the normal course of its operations, the group is exposed to gold price, currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks.
In order to manage these risks, the group may enter into transactions which make use of on-balance sheet derivatives.
The group does not acquire, hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
The group has developed a risk management process to facilitate, control and monitor these risks.
The board has approved and monitors this risk management process, inclusive of documented treasury policies, counterpart limits, controlling and reporting structures.
Controlling risk in the group The treasury committee is responsible for risk management activities within the group.
The treasury committee reviews and recommends to the board all treasury counterparts, limits, instruments and hedge strategies.
At least two members of the treasury committee need to be present for a decision to be made.
The treasury committee is only permitted to invest with institutions with investment ratings of AAor higher.
The treasurer is responsible for managing investment, gold price, currency, liquidity and credit risk.
The treasury function monitors adherence to treasury risk management policy and counterpart limits and provides regular reports.
The financial risk management objectives of the group are defined as follows: Safeguarding the group core earnings stream from its major assets through the effective control and management of gold price risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.
Effective and efficient usage of credit facilities in both the short and long term through the adoption of reliable liquidity management planning and procedures.
Ensuring that investment and hedging transactions are undertaken with creditworthy counterparts.
Ensuring that all contracts and agreements related to risk management activities are coordinated, consistent throughout the group and comply where necessary with all relevant regulatory and statutory requirements.
Foreign currency and commodity price risk In the normal course of business, the group enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies primarily Euro, South African Rand and Communaut Financire Africaine Franc.
As a result, the group is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In general, the group does not enter into derivatives to manage these currency risks.
Generally, the group does not hedge its exposure to gold price fluctuation risk and sells at market spot prices.
Gold sales are disclosed in US dollars and do not expose the group to any currency fluctuation risk.
However, during periods of capital expenditure or loan finance, the company may use forward contracts or options to reduce the exposure to price movements, while maintaining significant exposure to spot prices.
These derivatives may establish a fixed price for a portion of future production while the group maintains the ability to benefit from increases in the spot gold price for the majority of future gold production.
At year end, the volume of outstanding forward sale contracts was 126 744 ounces.
Also refer to the sensitivity analysis performed on the valuation of the financial liabilities in Note 21.
The group is also exposed to fluctuations in the price of consumables, such as fuel, steel, rubber, cyanide and lime, mainly due to changes in the price of oil, as well as fluctuations in exchange rates.

During the year to 31 December 2008, a loss of US$0.4 million 2007: US$0.3 million was recognised due to hedge ineffectiveness.
Interest rate and liquidity risk Fluctuations in interest rates impact on the value of short term cash investments and interest payable on financing activities including long term loans, giving rise to interest rate risk.
In the ordinary course of business, the group receives cash from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
The group generally enters into variable interest bearing borrowings.
This cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested in a manner to achieve maximum returns while minimising risks.
The group has in the past been able to actively source financing through public offerings, shareholder loans and third party loans.
A 1% change in interest rates on the groups net cash cash and cash equivalents less borrowings would result in a US$2.6 million 2007: US$2.9 million impact on profit before tax.
The group typically holds financial investments with an average maturity of 30 days to ensure adequate liquidity.
The maturity of borrowings is set out in Note 15 and the maturity of other financial liabilities is set out in Note 21.
In the ordinary course of business, the group receives cash from the proceeds of its gold sales and is required to fund working capital requirements.
This cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested in a manner to achieve market-related returns while minimising risks.
The group is able to actively source financing at competitive rates.
The counterparts are financial and banking institutions of good credit standing.
Management believes that the working capital resources, by way of internal sources and banking facilities, are sufficient to fund the groups currently foreseeable future business requirements.

Randgold Resources | 101 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Concentration of credit risk The groups derivative financial instruments and cash balances do not give rise to a concentration of credit risk because it deals with a variety of major financial institutions.
Its receivables and loans are regularly monitored and assessed.
Receivables are impaired when it is probable that amounts outstanding are not recoverable as set out in the accounting policy note for receivables.
Gold bullion, the groups principal product, is produced in Mali.
The gold produced is sold to the largest accredited gold refinery in the world.
Credit risk is further managed by regularly reviewing the financial statements of the refinery.
The group is further not exposed to significant credit risk, as cash is received within a few days of the sale taking place.
Included in receivables is US$8.7 million net of a present value provision 2007: US$18.8 million, see Note 7, relating to indirect taxes owing to Morila and Loulo by the State of Mali, which are denominated in FCFA.
Receivables also include advances to a contractor totalling US$12.1 million 2007: US$12.1 million see Note 25.
Available-for-sale financial assets consists of a portfolio of auction rate securities.
The trading market for these instruments has become substantially illiquid as a result of unusual conditions in the credit markets.
The company continues to receive interest on the auction rate securities.
A 10% negative change in the fair value of the auction rate securities will result in a US$4 million loss related to these assets.
Capital risk management The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including borrowings and trade and other payables, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet, plus net debt.
