These balances have not been netted above as settlement is not intended to take place simultaneously or on a net basis.
The credit rating of counterparties with which cash and cash equivalents were held ranged from AAA to A with Standard and Poors and Aaa to A with Moodys in both 2008 and 2007.
The majority of cash and cash equivalents are xed rate financial assets held for periods ranging from one day to three months.
Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this analysis current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
This denition of net debt measures balances at the expected value of future undiscounted cash ows due to arise on maturity of financial instruments and removes the balance sheet adjustments made from the re-measurement of hedged risks under fair value hedges and the use of the effective interest method as required by IAS 39.
In addition, the gross balances are adjusted to take account of netting arrangements amounting to 256 million 2007: 49 million.
Net debt is a non-GAAP measure since it is not dened in accordance with IFRS but it is a key indicator used by management in order to assess operational performance and balance sheet strength.
