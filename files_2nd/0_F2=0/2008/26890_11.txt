The Company has surplus expenses carried forward of 114.2m 2007 102.2m.
Given the Companys current investment strategy, it is unlikely to generate sufficient UK taxable profits to relieve these expenses.
As at 31 January 2008 there is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 32.0m 2007 30.7m.
This deferred tax asset relates to the current and prior year unutilised expenses.
It is considered unlikely that there will be a liability in the future against which the deferred tax asset can be offset.
Therefore, the tax asset has not been recognised.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust and the intention to continue meeting the conditions to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the disposal of investments.

However, the dividend payable will be based on the number of shares in issue on the record date and will reect any purchases and cancellations of shares by the Company settled subsequent to the year end.
Ordinary dividends paid by the Company carry a tax credit at a rate of 10%.
The credit discharges the tax liability of shareholders subject to income tax at less than the higher rate.
Shareholders liable to pay tax at the higher rate will have further tax to pay.

The Stepped Rate Interest Loan comprises adjustable Stepped Rate Interest Loan Notes of 5,133,520 and Stepped Rate Interest Bonds of 20,534,079 issued at 97.4%.
These amounts are repayable on 2 January 2018 exclusive of any redemption expenses, together with a premium of 8,366,513.
The initial interest rate in 1987 on the Loan Notes and Bonds was 7.16% per annum.
This increased annually by 7.5% compound until January 1998 when it reached its current rate of 14.75%.
However, the combined effect of this interest charge and the accrual of the premium referred to above results in an effective interest rate of 11.28% per annum.
Interest is payable in January and July each year.
Interest on the Loan Notes is variable in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the lender, First Debenture Finance PLC FDF.
The Company has guaranteed the repayment of 34,012,852, being its proportionate share 65.15% of the required amount to enable FDF to meet all of its liabilities to repay principal and interest on its 52.2 million of 11.125% Severally Guaranteed Debenture Stock 2018.
There is a oating charge on all the Companys present and future assets to secure this obligation.
The Company has also agreed to meet its proportionate share of any expenses incurred by FDF, including any tax liability which may accrue to FDF generally or as a result of the redemption or earlier transfer of the Stepped Rate Loan Notes and Bonds held by FDF.
The accounting treatment adopted in respect of the stepped rate interest and redemption premiums is set out in the Statement of Accounting Policies.
ii The Fixed Rate Interest Loan of 42,000,000 is due to Fintrust Debenture PLC Fintrust.
This loan is repayable in 2023 and carries interest at the rate of 9.25125% per annum on the principal amount payable in arrears by equal half yearly instalments in May and November in each year.
As security for this loan, the Company has granted a oating charge over all its undertakings, property and assets in favour of the lender.
This charge ranks pari passu with the oating charge noted in 10 i above.
The original loan from Fintrust is stated at net proceeds being the principal amount of 30,000,000 less issue costs of 141,053 plus accrued finance costs.
42 The Merchants Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 January 2008 10.
Current Assets and Creditors continued Following the liquidation of Kleinwort Overseas Investment Trust plc KOIT in March 1998, the Company assumed 12,000,000 of KOITs obligations to Fintrust.
Both the interest cost and repayment terms of this additional borrowing were identical to the Companys existing loan of 30,000,000.
In order that the finance costs on this new borrowing be comparable to existing market rates at that time, the Company also received a premium payment from KOIT of 5,286,564.
This premium is being amortised over the remaining life of the loan, as set out in the Statement of Accounting Policies.
At 31 January 2008, the unamortised premium included within the Fixed Rate Interest Loan balance of greater than one year amounted to 4,077,022 2007 4,229,629. iii The 30,000,000 5.875% Secured Bonds, repayable on 20 December 2029, carry interest at the rate of 5.875% per annum on the principal amount payable in arrears by equal half yearly instalments in June and December each year.
As security for this loan the Company has granted a oating charge ranking pari passu with the oating charges referred to in Note 10 i and 10 ii above over the whole of the present and future undertakings, property, assets and rights of the Company.
The accounting treatment adopted in respect of the Bonds is set out in the Statement of Accounting Policies.
iv The 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock is secured by a oating charge on the assets of the Company, which ranks prior to any other oating charge.
Interest is repayable in arrears by equal half yearly instalments in May and November.
v The 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock is recognised as a creditor due after more than one year under the provisions of FRS25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.

Securities listed on a recognised stock exchange are generally regarded as being readily convertible into cash and hence unrealised profits amounting to 16,644,526 in respect of such securities, currently included within the Capital Reserve - Unrealised, may be regarded as distributable under Company Law.
However, under the terms of the Companys Articles of Association, Capital Reserves are available for distribution only by way of redemption or purchase of any of the Companys own shares and not for any other purpose.
The Company may therefore only distribute, by way of dividend, accumulated amounts credited to the Revenue Reserve.

Contingent Assets The Company has a contingent asset as at the balance sheet date relating to VAT recoverable.
The contingent asset has arisen as a result of the European Court of Justice ruling on 28 June 2007 in the VAT case, brought by JP Morgan Fleming Claverhouse Trust plc in conjunction with the Association of Investment Companies concerning VAT exemption on management expenses for investment trusts.
An amount of VAT payable in previous years may be recoverable but it is not yet possible to quantify an amount pending the conclusion of discussions with the Manager.
Contingent Liabilities and Commitments At 31 January 2008 there were no outstanding contingent liabilities 2007 nil in respect of underwriting commitments and calls on partly paid investments.
Details of the guarantee provided by the Company as part of the terms of the Stepped Rate Loan are provided in Note 10 i Current Assets and Creditors on page 42.

Financial Risk Management policies and procedures The Company invests in equities and other investments in accordance with its investment objective as stated on page 2.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to certain inherent risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are: market risk comprising market price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors approach to the management of these risks are set out below.
The Investment Manager, in close cooperation with the Board of Directors, coordinates the Companys risk management.
The Board determines the objectives and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, as set out below.
These policies have remained substantially unchanged during the current and preceding period.
Market Risk The fair value and or future cash ows of a financial instrument held by the Company may uctuate due to changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises market price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk.
The Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from the uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Companys investment portfolio is based wholly in the United Kingdom and hence is chiey exposed to economic conditions in that country.
An analysis of the Companys portfolio is shown on pages 9 and 10.
Management of market price risk The Board meets regularly to monitor the diversication of assets within the portfolio and the investment performance, in order to evaluate the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
A dedicated fund manager has the responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selection in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward prole.
The value of the Companys listed investments which were exposed to market price risk as at 31 January was as follows: 2008 2007 000s 000s Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 608,424 695,743 11111 11111 Market price risk sensitivity The following illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2007: 20% in the fair values of the Companys quoted equities.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions in the year.
The sensitivity analysis on the net return after taxation and net assets is based on the impact of a 20% increase or decrease in the value of the Companys investments at each closing balance sheet date and the consequent impact on the investment management fees for the year, with all other variables held constant.
46 The Merchants Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 January 2008 20.
Financial Risk Management policies and procedures continued 2008 2008 2007 2007 20% Increase 20% Decrease 20% Increase 20% Decrease in fair value in fair value in fair value in fair value 000s 000s 000s 000s Income statement net return after tax Revenue return 180 180 192 192 Capital return 121,351 121,351 138,791 138,791 11111 11111 11111 11111 Change in net return on ordinary activities attributable to Ordinary Shareholders 121,171 121,171 138,599 138,599 11111 11111 11111 11111 Change in total net assets 121,171 121,171 138,599 138,599 11111 11111 11111 11111 ii Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk of movement in the values of overseas financial instruments as a result of uctuations in exchange rates.
A number of the investments have global operations and therefore profits received from them can be affected by currency movements, both on a transactional and transitional basis.
This is incorporated within the market price of each investment.
Management of currency risk The Company invests predominantly in UK listed securities with the effect that the total net assets and the total return are not materially affected by currency movements.
Any income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt e. g. as a result of a corporate action.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
iii Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments as a result of uctuations in interest rates.
Management of interest rate risk The Company invests predominantly in equities, the values of which are not directly affected by changes in prevailing market interest rates.
Therefore there is minimal exposure to interest rate risk.
In the year to 31 January 2008, the Company held no xed interest securities.
The Companys policy is to remain substantially fully invested and thus does not expect to hold significant cash balances.
The Company nances its operations through a mixture of share capital, retained earnings and long term borrowings.
Movement in interest rates will not affect the finance costs and financial liabilities and net assets of the Company as all the borrowings of the Company carry xed rates of interest and were issued as a planned level of gearing.
The borrowings are carried in the balance sheet at amortised cost rather than fair value.
Therefore the impact of sensitivity to interest rate risk is not material and accordingly the Companys net assets and total return are not materially affected.
Interest rate exposure The Companys exposure to oating rate interest on assets as at 31 January 2008 was 5,945,000 2007 7,003,000.
The Companys exposure to xed interest rates on liabilities as at 31 January 2008 was 113,414,000 2007 113,548,000.
Interest rates received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts respectively, is approximate to 5.00% and 6.35% per annum 2007: 5.25% and 6.10% per annum.
47 The Merchants Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 January 2008 20.
Financial Risk Management policies and procedures continued The xed rate interest bearing liabilities bear the following coupon and effective rates as at 31 January 2008 and 31 January 2007 Amount Effective Maturity borrowed Coupon rate since date 000s Rate Inception Stepped Rate Interest Loan 2 1 2018 25,668 14.75% 11.28% Fixed Rate Interest Loan original loan 20 11 2023 30,000 9.25125% 9.51% Fixed Rate Interest Loan additional loan 20 11 2023 12,000 9.25125% 6.00% 5.875% Secured Bonds 2029 20 12 2029 30,000 5.875% 6.23% 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock n a 1.375 4.00% 4.00% 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock n a 1,178 3.65% 3.65% The effective rates are calculated in accordance with FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as detailed in the Statement of Accounting Policies.
The weighted average effective rate of the Companys xed interest bearing liabilities excluding the 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock and the 5% Cumulative Preference Stock is 8.54% 2007 8.54% and the weighted average period to maturity of these liabilities is 16.2 years 2007 17.2 years.
The above year end amounts are reasonably representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure does not change materially.
Therefore the Companys net return and net assets are not materially affected by changes in interest rates.
