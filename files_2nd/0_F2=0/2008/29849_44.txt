In June 2007 the European Court of Justice found in favour of the appellants and in November 2007 HM Revenue and Customs HMRC announced their withdrawal from the case.
This means VAT is no longer charged on investment management fees and it should be possible to recover some of the VAT paid in the past.
A number of legal and procedural matters remain to be resolved before certainty is reached in respect of any entitlement to repayment of VAT.
As at 31 December 2008 there were no other contingent assets liabilities or capital commitments for the Company and the Group 2007: nil.
