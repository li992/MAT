In November 2007, Antares issued the Group with an additional 2m shares in exchange for the provision of agency services in 2008 and 2009 Antares sponsors Antares Syndicate 1274, which began underwriting for the 2008 year of account with an underwriting capacity of 135m.
Chaucer Syndicates Limited, a Group company, manages the Syndicate At the end of 2008 the investment in Antares remains in an active market.
Accordingly, the group has valued it by reference to the Groups share of NAV and future income discounted at an appropriate rate of return 2 At the end of 2008, hedge funds with a total value of 32.2m remained unlisted on an active market.
In accordance with stated accounting policies, the Group valued these based on net asset values provided by independent third party fund administrators, by reference to listed securities of a similar nature, or by using pricing models which are reviewed and approved by an independent pricing specialist as applicable 3 Overseas deposits represent monies kept in overseas funds managed by Lloyds.
The funds are required in order to protect policyholders in overseas markets and enable the Group to operate in those markets.
The access to those funds is restricted and the Group cannot influence the investment strategy INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Group philosophy is that investment activities are complementary to the primary underwriting activities of the business and should not, therefore, divert or utilise financial resources otherwise available for insurance operations.
The maintenance of sufficient capital and liquidity to support the business are at the heart of the Groups financial market risk policies, together with the aim for long-run enhancement of investment returns, within a set of defined risk constraints, through the efficient diversification of investments across a range of asset classes.
These asset classes include cash and deposits, investment grade and high yield bonds, equities and hedge funds.
The Board of Directors of Chaucer Holdings PLC approves the investment risk constraints, which quantify the maximum amount of investment risk permitted over a one-year time horizon, on an annual basis.
These establish the risk budget used to derive the maximum allocation assignable that can be assigned to each asset class.
During the year, the Group changed constraints to an absolute return basis as follows: 2008 No more than a 20% probability of underperforming cash by more than 1.0% No more than a 10% probability of underperforming cash by more than 2.5% The Group charged the risk constraints in November 2008 to: No more than a 5% probability of underperforming cash by more than 2.5% on a rolling one-year basis The constraints maintained in 2007, which were defined in terms of the probability of a given adverse result in a 12-month period, were as follows: 2007 No more than a 2.0% probability of an investment return of less than Nil, and No more than a 0.2% probability of an investment return of less than -5.0% The Groups Investment Committee, which meets at least quarterly, is responsible for reviewing and amending asset allocations in accordance with investment risk constraints.
Due regard is given to the outlook for each asset class as a result of changes in market conditions and investment returns and proposed asset allocations are tested using stochastic modelling techniques prior to formal approval by the Investment Committee.
Chaucer Holdings PLC Annual Report 2008 Back-End-Final-AW 17 4 09 14:36 Page 97 97 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 The Investment Committee is also responsible for selecting investment managers and funds for each asset class allocation.
INVESTMENT MANAGERS The Group invests a significant proportion of funds in fixed income securities managed by professional portfolio managers.
Each manager operates within a defined set of investment guidelines that comprise details of the investment universe from which managers may select securities and any exposure limits applied to asset classes and counterparties within that universe.
The Group measures the performance of each manager against an appropriate benchmark for each asset class under management.
The following table summarises the performance during the year of each portfolio manager against the chosen benchmark BM set.
UK Sterling returns US Dollar returns Euro returns Canadian Dollar returns Manager BM Manager BM Manager BM Manager BM %%%%%%%% 2008 GRNEAM - - 1.36 2.54 ---- Aberdeen Asset Management - - 6.95 2.54 ---- Crdit Agricole 2.37 5.74 ------ Alliance Bernstein - - 14.80 5.54 ---- 2007 to 30 June Alliance Bernstein 2.29 1.97 2.51 2.33 1.77 1.72 - - Crdit Agricole 2.08 1.97 2.39 2.33 - - 1.68 1.57 2007 to 31 December GRNEAM - - 4.03 2.59 ---- Aberdeen Asset Management - - 3.26 2.59 ---- The 2008 returns on US Situs bond portfolios managed by Aberdeen Asset Management and GenRe New England Asset Management GRNEAM were very disappointing.
Aberdeen underperformance resulted mainly from the widespread markdown of asset-backed securities that, at the end of the year, priced the securities of values well below recovery rates anticipated in the worst of modelled economic scenarios.
A US$1.7m exposure to Lehman Brothers which the Group wrote down to US$0.1m as at 31 December 2008, adversely affected the GRNEAM performance.
Alliance Bernstein performance was particularly poor due to large exposures to investment grade corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities that were marked down significantly as credit spreads widened and market liquidity deteriorated forcing asset prices down.
Absolute return bond funds also performed poorly because of exposures to credit and asset backed securities.
The higher than expected levels of volatility in these funds resulted in the decision by the Group to exit all absolute return bond funds which was completed in January 2009.
RISK POLICIES Market risk Interest rate risk Traditionally the most material element of risk within fixed income portfolios is interest rate risk, with risk increasing as durations get longer and returns being largely dependent on the direction of interest rates in domestic markets.
The sensitivities shown in the table below assume that underlying securities have a 100% correlation to changes in interest rates.
Change in interest rates Impact on capital %m 31 December 2008 2.0 5.0 1.0 2.5 -1.0 2.5 -2.0 5.0 31 December 2007 2.0 0.4 1.0 0.2 -1.0 0.2 -2.0 0.4 Chaucer Holdings PLC Annual Report 2008 Back-End-Final-AW 17 4 09 14:36 Page 98 98 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 The table below shows the maturity profile of bonds at the balance sheet date.
Absolute return bond funds are excluded from the analysis as the funds are not directly correlated with charges in interest rates.

At 31 December, the portion of financial assets, cash and deposits by currency was as follows: 2008 2007 % % UK Sterling 47.4 55.0 US Dollar 48.3 43.0 Other 4.3 2.0 100.0 100.0 If Syndicate 1084 holds a material surplus of non-sterling assets attributable to the Group because of accumulated profits, the Group hedges the excess using forward currency contracts until such time that it is expected to be distributed.
There were no open forward currency contracts at the balance sheet date 2007 Nil.
The foreign exchange management policy adopted by the Group ensures that there is no material net economic sensitivity or exposure to changes in exchange rates.
Equity risk The Group reviews the allocation to equities in the context of the risk budget with a view to optimising total returns and diversifies risk accordingly.
The Group reduced the investment risk budget in November 2008 and a quantitative assessment of investment risk has determined that a maximum investment of up to 2% of total Group funds may be allocated to equities 2007 14%.
The actual allocation made at any point in time is determined and reviewed by the Investment Committee on a quarterly basis with due regard given to current market conditions and investment opportunities.
The Investment Committee takes professional advice in relation to the outlook for investment markets and will reduce equity exposure if risk adjusted returns appear unfavourable relative to other asset classes.
Having considered all these factors the Investment Committee took action to reduce equity exposure as soon as practicably possible and reduced exposures to less than 1% of Group investments by the end of the year.
It is estimated that a 10% change in the FTSE All Share or MSCI World Indices would result in a 0.6m 2007 9.9m change in the value of equity investments at 31 December 2008.
A more severe scenario based on a fall of 25% would result in expected losses of 1.5m 2007 24.8m.
Chaucer Holdings PLC Annual Report 2008 Back-End-Final-AW 17 4 09 14:36 Page 99 99 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 Hedge funds During the first half of 2008, credit spreads widened significantly and management considered that skilled hedge fund managers could extract on attractive risk adjusted return from the fixed income sector.
Credit spreads continued to widen and credit default swaps used by funds to hedge cash credit positions failed to compensate, or even proved detrimental to funds resulting in huge losses and triggering margin calls for settlement.
As investors fled risk assets, this forced managers to sell further large holdings of securities at distressed levels to meet redemption requests.
This precipitated a collapse in bid prices of securities as sellers exceeded buyers and falling valuations forced many funds to collapse, wind up or gate investors to mange redemptions in an orderly fashion without further destroying investors capital.
During the year Group losses from hedge funds amounted to 30.4m representing a 27.0% loss on weighted average funds and a 20.2% loss on funds invested at the start of the year plus new funds invested during the year.
In 2008, hedge fund losses comprised: Return on Loss average funds Absolute return m%% Fund of funds 5.5 13.8 13.8 Equity long short 6.9 16.4 13.0 Fixed income 18.0 58.7 31.3 30.4 27.0 27.0 The Group has decided to exit all hedge fund investments at the earliest opportunity although it does not anticipated that this exercise will complete until 2010.
The Directors consider that 2008 hedge fund losses of 20% represent a realistic stress test on a forward looking basis which would result in losses of 30.9m based on holdings at 31 December 2008 2007 16.8m.
Liquidity risk The Group is subject to calls on cash resources, mainly in respect of claims on insurance business, on a daily basis.
The Group operates and maintains a Liquidity Risk Policy designed to ensure that cash is available to settle liabilities and other obligations when due without excessive cost to the business.
The expected payment profile of undiscounted liabilities at 31 December 2008 is as follows: Maturity bands Years Balance sheet 1 1-2 2-5 5-10 10 Total m m m m m m m 31 December 2008 Subordinated debt 45.1 2.4 2.4 7.1 11.9 87.2 111.0 Technical provisions 1,508.9 640.3 290.9 354.9 122.1 100.7 1,508.9 Trade and other payables 154.0 143.7 2.8 3.2 4.3 - 154.0 1,708.0 786.4 296.1 365.2 138.3 187.9 1,773.9 31 December 2007 Subordinated debt 33.2 2.7 2.7 8.2 13.7 84.0 111.3 Technical provisions 978.4 515.4 178.7 196.8 72.9 14.6 978.4 Convertible loan stock 1.1 1.1 ---- 1.1 Trade and other payables 139.1 126.6 3.3 4.8 4.4 - 139.1 1,151.8 645.8 184.7 209.8 91.0 98.6 1,229.9 The Liquidity Risk Policy, which is subject to review and approval by the Risk & Capital Committee on an annual basis, sets limits for cash required to meet expected cash flows and includes a Contingency Funding Plan, which details the process and provisions for liquidating assets and or raising additional funds required to meet liabilities in extreme circumstances.
The majority of financial assets, cash and deposits are liquid or capable of liquidation at very short notice.
At 31 December 2008, approximately 90% 2007 91% of such assets were capable of liquidation within 3 working days, 2% 2007 9% within 120 days, and 8% 2007 Nil later than 120 days.
