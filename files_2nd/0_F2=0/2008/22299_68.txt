Back-End-Final-AW 17 4 09 14:36 Page 127 127 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 33.
Capital The main component of capital held by the Group is the Funds at Lloyds FAL held by the groups various corporate members and supporting the Groups underwriting interests.
The FAL requirements are determined through Lloyds implementation of the Financial Service Authoritys Individual Capital Assessment ICA regulatory regime.
Each managed syndicate is required to produce an ICA that represents the managing agencys view of the level of capital required by the syndicate at the 99.5% confidence level to meet all its ultimate liabilities as they fall due.
The ICA considers all existing liabilities, plus those incurred by one year of new business: as such, it encompasses the volatility of future underwriting results, potential reserve deteriorations on prior years, and other risks such as financial market volatility, credit risk and operational risk.
ICAs are reviewed annually by Lloyds, although the managing agency is required to continually monitor the risk profiles of its managed syndicates to ensure that the current agreed ICAs are appropriate.
For each syndicate, the ICA is uplifted by 35% to determine its Economic Capital Assessment ECA.
Lloyds then use these to determine an ECA for each corporate member, taking account of the corresponding underwriting interests in each syndicate.
The final ECA for each corporate member is subject to a minimum of 40% of the corporate members agreed premium capacity.
Corporate members are required to hold sufficient Funds at Lloyds to cover both the ECA and any share of solvency deficits on open years of account, and the Groups corporate members complied with these requirements throughout the year.
The Group currently underwrites at Lloyds for the 2009 year of account at an ECA of 57.9% 2008 year of account 47.3% whereby it must deposit Funds at Lloyds to this proportion of the Groups Overall Premium Limit OPL for that year.
Solvency requirements have increased primarily because of the additional reserving risk assumed following the purchase of Quantas capacity on Syndicate 4000, in February 2008.
The Syndicate, which writes predominantly US-based casualty business, had an ECA of 82.7% for 2008.
The table below shows the Groups OPL for the 2009 and 2008 years of account and the composition of assets deposited to meet the associated FAL requirements, including the estimate for 2009 based on the updated plan.
Year of account 1 2009 estimate 2009 2008 m m m Group underwriting interests 546.1 484.4 519.8 Quota share -- 25.0 Overall premium limit 546.1 484.4 544.8 FAL ratio average 53.6% 57.9% 47.3% FAL requirement 292.7 280.5 257.7 Funding of open year of account losses 114.7 58.6 38.4 Total FAL requirement 407.4 339.1 296.1 FAL requirement satisfied by: Investments 172.8 172.8 118.8 Personal reserves 158.1 90.9 80.2 Letters of credit Group economic interest 56.0 56.0 56.0 Capital provision quota share reinsurer 15.6 15.6 15.6 Credits from Lloyds for undistributed profits 4.9 4.9 27.5 2 2 407.4 340.2 298.1 1 This represents the Groups current estimate of the requirements to support the revised underwriting interests, following fundraising of 75.0m approved by shareholders on 13 February 2009 2 The excess over the FAL requirements in respect of the 2008 and 2009 years of account is due to revaluation of investments at the end of the year, subsequent to meeting the FAL requirements Subsequent to the initial provision of capital, as detailed above, the Group reached an agreement with Lloyds in regards to the use of funds held by the Group at Lloyds to support the run-off of the Groups liabilities in Syndicate 4000.
As a result, the FAL requirement reduced to 266.8m.
Lloyds will release the excess of 14.8m over the set requirement to the Group in June 2009, subject to the impact on capital requirements of changes in underwriting plans and movements in rates of exchange.
