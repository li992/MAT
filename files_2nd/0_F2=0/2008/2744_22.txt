GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Notes Notes to to the the Accounts Accounts 1.
Accounting Policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Cairn Energy PLC Cairn or the Group for the period ended 31 December 2008 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 6 April 2009.
The Group is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publically traded.
The registered office is located at 50 Lothian Road, Edinburgh, Scotland.
Cairn prepares its accounts on a historical cost basis.
Where there are assets and liabilities calculated on a different basis, this fact is disclosed in the relevant accounting policy.
b Accounting standards Cairn prepares its accounts in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
Relevant new standards and interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet effective and not applied in these financial statements are as follows: Date of adoption Title Change to accounting policy by Cairn Impact on initial application Effective date from 1 January 2009 Revised IAS 23 May result in more borrowing costs being 1 Jan 2009 Decrease in borrowing Borrowing Costs Revised capitalised than current policy.
costs charged to the income statement, with corresponding increase in assets.
IAS 1 Revised Presentation No changes to current accounting policy.
1 Jan 2009 Presentation and disclosure of Financial Statements requirements for certain items in the Income Statement.
Effective date from 1 July 2009 Revised IAS 27 Consolidated and Reclassification of gain on deemed disposal 1 Jul 2009 Presentation of gain on deemed Separate Financial Statements from Income Statement direct to equity.
Share for share exchange transactions in subsidiaries will be recognised at book value rather than fair value.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations Expensing of all transaction costs.
1 Jul 2009 Applies only to business Revised combinations after effective date.
No other IFRS as issued by the IASB which are not yet effective are expected to have an impact on the Groups or Companys financial statements.
Cairn has adopted IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
This interpretation requires share based payment awards relating to employees of a subsidiary to be recognised in the equity of that company.
On adoption, there was no impact at group or company level.
Cairn has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
Cairn early adopted this standard as of 1 January 2008.
The Group concluded that the operating segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 are equivalent to the business segments previously identified under IAS 14.
IFRS 8 disclosures are shown in Note 4, including related revised comparative information.
c Presentational currency The functional currency of Cairn Energy PLC, the ultimate parent company of the Group, is Sterling.
These accounts have been presented in US Dollars $, the functional currency of most companies within the Group.
It is deemed to be more appropriate to present the financial statements in line with the functional currency of the majority of the Group.
The Groups policy on foreign currencies is detailed in note 1 p. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 81 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued d Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the Balance Sheet date.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Any goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment.
Goodwill is written off where circumstances indicate that the value of the underlying cash generating unit including the asset may no longer support the carrying value of goodwill.
Any such impairment loss arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the period.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Negative goodwill is credited immediately to the Income Statement.
Cairn has used the exemption granted under section 230 1 b of the Companies Act 1985 that allows for the non disclosure of the Income Statement of the parent company.
The loss attributable to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2008 was $19.4m 2007: profit of $1,170.7m.
e Joint Ventures Cairn participates in several unincorporated Joint Ventures that involve the joint control of assets used in the Groups oil and gas exploration and producing activities.
Cairn accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of Joint Ventures in which the Group holds an interest, classified in the appropriate Balance Sheet and Income Statement headings.
Cairns principal licence interests are jointly controlled assets.
A list of Cairns interests in unincorporated Joint Ventures is given on page 73 and 74. f Revenue and other income Revenue from operating activities Revenue represents Cairns share of oil, gas and condensate production, recognised on a direct entitlement basis, and tariff income received for third-party use of operating facilities and pipelines in accordance with agreements.
Other income Income received as operator from Joint Ventures is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with Joint Venture agreements and is included within Other operating income in the Income Statement.
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method on an accruals basis and is recognised within Finance income in the Income Statement.
g Oil and gas intangible exploration appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment development producing assets Cairn follows a successful efforts-based accounting policy for oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis.
Costs are held, undepleted, within exploration appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining exploration targets is capitalised initially within exploration appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities.
Exploration appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
The success or failure of each exploration appraisal effort is judged on a well-by-well basis.
Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised exploration appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within development producing assets after testing for impairment see below.
Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons that are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the Income Statement.
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are capitalised within development producing assets on a field-by-field basis.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development producing asset or replaces part of the existing development producing asset.
Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Net proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs.
Any surplus proceeds are credited to the Income Statement.
Net proceeds from any disposal of development producing assets are credited against the previously capitalised cost.
A gain or loss on disposal of a development producing asset is recognised in the Income Statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset.
82 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued g Oil and gas intangible exploration appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment development producing assets continued Depletion Cairn depletes separately, where applicable, any significant components within development producing assets, such as fields, processing facilities and pipelines, which are significant in relation to the total cost of a development producing asset.
Cairn depletes expenditure on property, plant & equipment development producing assets on a unit of production basis, based on proved and probable reserves on a field-by-field basis.
In certain circumstances, fields within a single development area may be combined for depletion purposes.
Impairment Exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment following the guidance in IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources and tested for impairment where such indicators exist.
In such circumstances the exploration asset is allocated to development producing assets within the same operating segment and tested for impairment.
Any impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Where there are no development producing assets within an operating segment, the exploration appraisal costs are charged immediately to the Income Statement.
Impairment reviews on development producing assets are carried out on each cash-generating unit identified in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Cairns cash generating units are those assets which generate largely independent cash flows and are normally, but not always, single development areas.
At each reporting date, where there are indicators of impairment, the net book value of the cash generating unit is compared with the associated expected discounted future net cash flows.
If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to the Income Statement as impairment.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated short-term oil price of $50 bbl and a long-term oil price of $65 bbl 2007: shortand long-term of $60 bbl, or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 3%, and a discount rate of 10% 2007: 3% and 10% respectively.
Forecast production profiles are determined on an asset-by-asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a change in circumstances to the extent that the discounted future net cash flows are higher than the net book value at the time.
In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value or the carrying value that would have been determined net of depletion had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
h Property, plant & equipment other Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and depreciated over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Depreciation Annual Rate % method Tenants improvements 10-33 straight line Vehicles and equipment 25-50 straight line Depreciation is charged over the shorter of the economic life or the remaining term of the lease.
i Intangible assets other Intangible assets have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, and amortised over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Amortisation Annual Rate % method Software costs 25-50 straight line Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
j Investments The Companys investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
The recoverable value of investments is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is based on the discounted future net cash flows of the oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated short-term oil price of $50 bbl and a long-term oil price of $65 bbl 2007: shortand long-term of $60 bbl or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 3%, and a discount rate of 10% 2007: 3% and 10% respectively.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 83 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued k Inventory Inventories of oil and condensate held at the balance sheet date are valued at net realisable value based on the estimated selling price in accordance with established industry practice.
l Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
Financial assets are categorised as financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Group holds financial assets that are classified as either available-for-sale financial assets or loans and receivables, with the exception of derivative financial instruments, which are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities generally substantiate claims for repayment in cash or another financial asset.
Financial liabilities are categorised as either fair value through profit or loss or held at amortised cost.
All of the Groups financial liabilities are held at amortised cost, with the exception of derivative financial instruments, which are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial instruments are generally recognised as soon as the Group becomes party to the contractual regulations of the financial instrument.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency options to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.
The derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year are taken directly to the Income Statement.
The Group did not apply hedge accounting for derivative financial instruments held during the current and prior year.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are not classified as loans and receivables.
The Groups available-for-sale financial assets represent listed equity shares that are held at fair value the quoted market price.
Movements in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The cumulative gain or loss that arises on subsequent disposal of available-for-sale financial assets will be recycled through the Income Statement.
Loans and other receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment.
Trade and other receivables are recognised when invoiced.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The carrying amounts of loans and other receivables are tested at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective material evidence of impairment, for example overdue trade debt.
Any impairment losses are recognised through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the Income Statement or Balance Sheet in accordance with where the original receivable was recognised.
Bank deposits Bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months are held as a separate category of current asset and presented on the face of the Balance Sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade payables and other non derivative financial liabilities Trade payables and other creditors are non-interest bearing and are measured at cost.
Interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings All interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings represent amounts drawn under the Groups revolving credit facilities, classified according to the length of time remaining under the respective facility.
Loans are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest payable is accrued in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
84 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued l Financial instruments continued Finance leases Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to the Income Statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
The Group has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership lie with the Group and has therefore accounted for the contracts as finance leases.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred except for borrowing costs incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development projects that are capitalised within the development producing asset.
m Equity Equity instruments issued by Cairn are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, allocated between share capital and share premium.
n Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred income tax liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised, except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary timing difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they arise within the same entity and tax jurisdiction and the group intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
o Decommissioning At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning production facilities.
Cairn recognises the full discounted cost of dismantling and decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation arises.
The decommissioning asset is included within property, plant & equipment development producing assets with the cost of the related installation.
The liability is included within provisions.
Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning that alter the level of the provisions required are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset.
The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of production basis based on proved and probable reserves, is included in the Depletion and decommissioning charge in the Income Statement, and the unwinding of the discount on the provision is included within Finance costs.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 85 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued p Foreign currencies In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
The Group maintains the accounts of the parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency.
Where applicable, the Group translates parent and subsidiary accounts into the presentational currency, $, using the closing rate method for assets and liabilities that are translated into $ at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date and rates at the date of transactions for Income Statement accounts.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose functional currency is non $ directly to reserves.
Rates of exchange to $1 were as follows: 31 December Average 31 December Average 2008 2008 2007 2007 Sterling 0.684 0.540 0.504 0.500 Indian Rupee 48.620 43.146 39.400 41.339 q Employee benefits Pension schemes Cairn operates defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and India.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of Cairn and its subsidiaries.
Cairn also operates insured benefit schemes for certain Indian and Bangladeshi employees as required under local legislation.
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits these are treated as defined contribution schemes.
The pension cost charged represents contributions payable in the year in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
Share schemes The cost of awards to employees under Cairns LTIP and share option plans, granted after 7 November 2002, are recognised over the three-year period to which the performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured at the date of the award.
The shares are valued using either the Black Scholes or binomial model, further details of which are given in note 7.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense as recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified.
An additional expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Shares acquired to meet awards under these shares schemes are held by the ESOP Trust.
The accounts of the ESOP Trust are aggregated into these financial statements.
The costs of awards to employees, in the form of cash but based on share performance phantom options are recognised over the period to which the performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the liability arising from the transaction.
Termination benefits Cairn recognises a liability for termination benefits at the point where the Group is committed to making the payments in return for employee redundancy.

Accounting Policies continued r Operating lease commitments Cairn charges rentals payable under operating leases to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
The Group has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership lie with the lessor and has therefore accounted for the contracts as operating leases.
s Exceptional items Exceptional items are those not considered to be part of the normal operation of the business.
Such items are identified as exceptional and a full explanation is given in the notes to the accounts.
t Key estimations and assumptions The Group has used estimates and assumptions in arriving at certain figures within the financial statements.
The resulting accounting estimates may not equate with the actual results, which will only be known in time.
Those areas believed to be key areas of estimation are noted below, with further details of the assumptions used listed at the relevant note.

Acquisitions and Disposals 2008 transactions Disposal of Plectrum Petroleum Limited On 9 October 2008, the entire issued share capital of Plectrum Petroleum Limited whose principal asset was a 50% interest in Block Z-34, offshore Peru was transferred to Gold Oil Caribbean Limited a subsidiary of Gold Oil PLC Gold.
The Group made a payment of $1.5m to Gold in connection with the transfer.
However no gain or loss has been recognised, as Plectrum was sold at book value.
Capricorn Oil and Gas Tunisia Gmbh formerly REAP Gmbh, a subsidiary of Plectrum Petroleum Limited, which holds a 50% equity interest in the Nabeul permit offshore Tunisia was transferred to Capricorn Petroleum Limited, a member of the Group, prior to the sale of Plectrum Petroleum Limited.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 87 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 3.
Acquisitions and Disposals continued 2007 transactions a Acquisition of Plectrum Petroleum Limited formerly Plectrum Petroleum Plc On 7 September 2007, the Group announced a recommended cash offer for Plectrum.
Plectrum and its subsidiaries held a 50% equity interest in the Nabeul permit offshore Tunisia and in addition held interests in Australia, Peru and the UK at the time of acquisition.
The offer was declared unconditional in all respects and Cairn gained control of Plectrum on 10 October 2007.
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Plectrum as at the date of acquisition and the corresponding carrying amounts immediately prior to acquisition were: Fair value recognised Previous on acquisition carrying value $m $m Intangible exploration appraisal assets 72.6 4.9 Intangible assets other 12.0 Trade and other receivables 4.0 1.3 Cash and cash equivalents 6.1 6.1 Trade and other payables 3.2 3.2 Deferred tax liabilities 34.2 Provisions 1.7 Net assets 43.6 21.1 Goodwill arising on acquisition note 16 4.4 Total consideration 48.0 The provisions were reassessed during the year and reduced accordingly.
Consequently, goodwill arising on acquisition has been restated to $4.4m from $13.5m reported in the 31 December 2007 financial statements.
The total cost of the combination was $48.0m which is made up of: $m Cash purchase of Plectrum shares at 13p per share 46.5 Costs associated with the acquisition 1.5 48.0 Cash outflow on acquisition: $m Net cash acquired 6.1 Cash paid on acquisition 48.0 Net cash outflow 41.9 The goodwill of $4.4m arises on acquisition as consideration paid exceeds the fair value of assets acquired, including the deferred tax liability recognised.
Refer to note 16 for further details.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2007, Plectrum incurred a loss of $1.7m.
This loss is included in the results of the Group.
As Plectrum does not hold producing assets, the acquisition had no impact on Group revenue.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit for the Group in 2007 would have been $1,523.8m.
88 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 3.
Acquisitions and Disposals continued b Acquisition of medOil Plc On 7 September 2007, the Group announced a recommended cash offer for medOil.
medOil holds a 100% equity interest in the Louza permit offshore Tunisia and in addition has interests in Albania and applications pending in Spain.
The offer was declared unconditional in all respects and Cairn gained control of medOil on 10 October 2007.
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of medOil as at the date of acquisition and the corresponding carrying amounts immediately prior to acquisition were: Fair value recognised on Previous acquisition carrying value $m $m Intangible exploration appraisal assets 66.9 4.0 Trade and other receivables 1.6 Cash and cash equivalents 1.2 1.2 Trade and other payables 1.8 1.8 Provisions 2.1 Net assets 65.8 3.4 Negative goodwill arising on acquisition 35.0 Total consideration 30.8 Deferred tax liabilities recognised on acquisition have subsequently been reassessed and released in full.
Consequently, negative goodwill arising on acquisition has been restated to $35.0m from $17.4m reported in the 31 December 2007 financial statements.
The negative goodwill arises on acquisition as the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the consideration paid.
In accordance with IFRS the negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
The total cost of the combination was $30.8m which is made up of: $m Cash purchase of medOil shares at 23p per share 29.6 Costs associated with the acquisition 1.2 30.8 Cash outflow on acquisition: $m Net cash acquired 1.2 Cash received for share warrants exercised 1.6 Cash paid on acquisition 30.8 Net cash outflow 28.0 From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2007, medOil incurred a loss of $0.3m.
As medOil does not hold producing assets, the acquisition had no impact on Group revenue.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit for the Group in 2007 would have been $1,526.3m.
c Disposal of Cairn Energy Bangladesh Limited On 25 October 2007 Santos International Holdings Pty Limited acquired 100% of Cairn Energy Bangladesh Limited from the Group for a total cash consideration of $55.8m.
There is an additional contingent consideration of $20.0m, which is payable in tranches dependent upon future development as a result of the 2007 2008 exploration drilling programme, which has not been recognised.
As a result of this transaction the Group disposed of a 37.5% holding in Bangladesh Block 16, including Sangu, and a 45% interest in each of the Bangladesh Exploration Blocks 5 and 10.

Segmental Analysis Operating segments For management purposes, the Group is organised into two business units: the Capricorn Group, being Capricorn Oil Limited and its subsidiary undertakings, and the Cairn India Group, each reporting internally to its own chief executive.
There are three reportable operating segments as follows: Cairn India Limited Groups operations are primarily within India.
Capricorn Groups operations focus on new exploration activities in Greenland and the Mediterranean.
The Capricorn Group also includes the Groups interests in Bangladesh and Nepal and a share in certain North Indian assets operated by Cairn India Limited.
Cairn Energy PLC exists to accumulate the activities and results of Cairn UK Holdings Limited, an intermediate holding company and direct parent of Cairn India Limited, and Cairn Energy PLC company results.
Unallocated expenditure and net assets liabilities including amounts of a corporate nature, not specifically attributable to one of the sub-Groups, are also included within this segment.

In the current year this review determined that the value of certain units previously impaired within the Capricorn Group was in excess of the carrying value.
As a result a reversal of prior year impairment charges of $2.7m 2007: $3.7m has been recognised through the Income Statement.
At the year end the Group also reviews intangible exploration assets for indicators of impairment defined under IFRS 6.
Where such indicators are identified the Group tests those assets for impairment.
In the current year the write-down of intangible exploration appraisal assets followed an impairment test of the Capricorn Group cash generating unit.
The producing asset in this cash-generating unit is currently carried at net present value and no additional headroom exists to support the carrying value of exploration assets where indicators of impairment are identified.
As a result a write-down of $21.0m 2007: $58.9m in relation to intangible exploration appraisal assets has been charged to the Income Statement.
During the year, the Group relinquished Block 5 in Bangladesh.
As a result costs of $6.5m were charged to the Income Statement as unsuccessful exploration costs.
As these costs were previously fully impaired, the impairments have been released on relinquishment of the block.
Refer to details on the reason for impairment in the Operating and Exploration Review on page 18 and note 1 g for details of the assumptions used in the impairment calculation.

Staff Costs continued The Cairn Energy PLC share options have been valued using a binomial model.
The main inputs to the model include the number of options, share price, leaver rate, trigger points, discount rate and volatility.
Leaver rate assumptions are based on past history of employees leaving the Company prior to options vesting and are revised to equal the number of options that ultimately vest.
Trigger points are the profit points at which the relevant percentage of employees is assumed to exercise their options.
The risk-free rate is based on the yield on a zero coupon Government bond with a term equal to the expected term on the option being valued.
Volatility was determined as the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares of a peer group of similar companies selected from the FTSE, as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 72, over a ten-year period to the date of award.

$334.9m 2007: $341.7m of the loss has not been recognised as it is expected that these losses will expire during the period of an Indian tax holiday.
The remaining $34.2m 2007: $31.9m of the loss has not been recognised due to expectations regarding the level of income in the entity concerned.

Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies Group and Company The main risks arising from the Companys and the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price risk and credit risk.
The respective Boards of Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn India Limited review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below: The Groups treasury functions at Cairn Energy PLC, Capricorn Oil Limited, Cairn India Limited and local operational offices are responsible for managing liquidity and credit risk relating to instruments other than receivables for their respective businesses in accordance with the policy set by their Board.
This is carried out by monitoring of investment and funding requirements by using a number of techniques including daily cash flow monitoring.
They must also recognise and manage interest, foreign exchange and commodity price exposure whilst ensuring that the Company and the Group has adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet its immediate cash requirements.
Credit risk relating to receivables is managed by both Group, Cairn India Group and local management.
The primary financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash, shortand medium-term deposits, money market liquidity and mutual funds, intra-group loans, forward foreign exchange options, and other receivables and financial liabilities held at amortised cost.
The Groups strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Other alternatives like equity and other forms of non investment grade debt finance are reviewed by the respective Boards, when appropriate, to fund substantial acquisitions or oil and gas projects.
Liquidity risk Cairn India has available a $850.0m revolving credit facility to fund Rajasthan developments.
The facility was previously held by Cairn Energy PLC and certain of its subsidiaries but an amendment agreement was entered into on 22 November 2006 to transfer the facility to Cairn India.
Following the IPO of Cairn India on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India the amendment agreement became fully effective on 31 January 2007.
The facility is provided by a consortium of ten international banks expiry date 31 December 2011 and the International Finance Corporation expiry date 31 December 2015.
Interest is charged at floating rates determined by LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The maximum facility amount that can be drawn at any point in time is determined by reference to the net present value of the Rajasthan developments.
The full $850.0m facility is currently available to be drawn, of which $500.0m was drawn at 31 December 2008 2007: $75.0m.
Cairn India may cancel and repay the facility at any time.
Under the terms of the original agreement, as security under the facility, a share pledge was provided over the shares in Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited a 100% subsidiary of Cairn India Holdings Limited, which holds 50% of the Groups interest in Rajasthan.
On 28 March 2008 Cairn Energy PLC entered into a 30.0m revolving credit facility to fund its working capital.
The facility is jointly provided by The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and the Bank of Scotland PLC and expires on 31 January 2013.
At 31 December 2008 nil was drawn.
In addition, as at 31 December 2008 the Group has $80.0m 2007: $90.0m of facilities in place to cover the issue of bank guarantees.
Fixed rates of interest apply to these.
122 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 30.
Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies continued Liquidity risk continued The Group currently has surplus cash, which it has placed in a combination of money market liquidity funds and fixed-term deposits with a number of International and Indian banks and financial institutions, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to meet its short medium-term expenditure requirements.
The Group is conscious of the current environment and constantly monitors counterparty risk.
Policies are in place to limit counterparty exposure.
The Group monitors counterparties using published ratings and when investing in money market liquidity and mutual funds primarily by consideration of the funds investment policy.
Interest rate risk Surplus funds are placed on short medium term deposit at floating rates.
It is Cairns policy to deposit funds with banks or other financial institutions that offer the most competitive interest rate at time of issue.
The requirement to achieve an acceptable yield is balanced against the need to minimise liquidity and counterparty risk.
Short medium-term borrowing arrangements are available at floating rates.
The treasury function may from time to time opt to manage a proportion of the interest costs on this debt by using derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps.
At this time, however, there are no such instruments 2007: none.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups profit before tax to a change in interest rates through the impact on floating rate borrowings and deposits.
In addition there would be an increase of $0.8m to development producing assets carrying value as a result of the capitalisation of the borrowing costs for the Rajasthan development 2007: $0.4m.
Increase decrease Effect on profit in basis points before tax 2008 50 $4.5m 2007 50 $3.3m The amounts calculated are based on actual drawings and deposits in the periods for a 50 basis point movement in the total rate of interest on each loan or deposit.
Foreign currency risk Cairn manages exposures that arise from receipt of revenues in foreign currencies, by matching receipts and payments in the same currency, and actively managing the residual net position.
Generally the exposure has been limited given that receipts and payments are have mostly been in US dollars, and the functional currency of most companies in the Group is US dollars.
Currently there is a significant Indian Rupee requirement but forward foreign exchange options are being utilised to mitigate this exposure.
In order to minimise Cairns exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, currency assets are matched with currency liabilities by borrowing or entering into foreign exchange contracts in the applicable currency if deemed appropriate.
The loan facilities are multi-currency and allow drawings in currencies in US dollars, Sterling or such other currency as may be agreed between the lenders and Cairn from time to time.
Cairn reports in US dollars which, with most assets US dollar-denominated, minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Groups Balance Sheet.
Company and Group may from time to time, opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
During the year Cairn India entered into forward foreign exchange options to hedge the exposure of future Indian Rupee requirements as part of the Rajasthan Development.
Refer to note 31 for further details.
During 2007, a currency exchange option contract matured.
The contract was entered into by the Company in 2006 in order to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations resulting from transactions carried out in Indian Rupees as part of the IPO.
This was not exercised due to favourable movements in the exchange rate.
Commodity price risk There are implicit product price hedges in place through the pricing mechanisms applicable to Sangu, CB-OS 2 and Ravva Gas Sales Contracts GSCs.
The requirement for hedging instruments to unwind these pricing mechanisms is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
These implicit product price hedges do not give rise to any embedded derivatives under IAS 39.
Ravva and CB-OS 2 oil sales are made to approved government nominated buyers or approved third parties at floating prices.
This will also be the case for Rajasthan when sales commence.
No commodity price hedging contracts have been entered into during either the current or the previous year.
There were no outstanding commodity price contracts at the start of the year or at the end of the year.
The Group would not normally hedge commodity price risk but the respective Boards do monitor the position.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 123 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 30.
Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies continued Credit risk Cairn has obtained payment guarantees or letters of credit from buyers as payment security on both the CB-OS 2 and Sangu GSCs.
With respect to Ravva there is no payment security, however the buyers have been nominated by the GoI.
Investments in money market liquidity funds are only made with AAA-rated funds and where the investment policy is limited to liquidity instruments which excludes equity.
Deposits and other investments are generally only placed with banks or financial institutions that has a Moodys or Standard & Poors rating of AA and above.
As at the 31 December 2008, $1,089.7m of the cash equivalents was held with 13 banks and $335.7m was held with 14 money market funds.
The respective Boards will continue to assess the Groups strategies for managing credit risks but at this time they view existing policies as satisfactory for oil and gas sales in South Asia.
At the year end the Group does not have any significant concentrations of bad debt risk other than that disclosed in note 20.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.
Capital management The objective of the Groups capital management structure is to ensure that there remains sufficient liquidity within the Group to carry out committed work programme requirements.
The respective Groups monitor the long-term cash flow requirements of their businesses in order to assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet that objective and to maintain flexibility.
The respective Boards manage their own capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Groups may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, put in place new debt facilities or other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the period ended 31 December 2008.

Contingent Liabilities Ravva arbitration The calculation of the Government of Indias GoI share of petroleum produced from the Ravva oil field has been a matter of disagreement for some years.
Ravva is an unincorporated Joint Venture JV in which Cairn has an interest.
An arbitration panel opined in October 2004 and Cairn has been willing to be bound by the award, although it was not as favourable as had been hoped.
The GoI, however, has lodged an appeal in the Malaysian courts in respect of one element of the award that was in Cairns favour, namely the ONGC Carry issue.
Cairn challenged both the GoIs right to appeal and the grounds of that appeal.
A judgement was delivered at the Malaysian High Court on 12 January 2009 ruling in favour of the GoI and setting the arbitration award aside.
This has the effect of negating the original award in favour of Cairn.
This judgement is subject to appeal to the Malaysian Court of Appeal and, potentially, the Malaysian Federal Court.
Cairn has appealed to the Malaysian Court of Appeal.
Should Cairn finally lose the argument through the Malaysian courts, given the terms of the High Courts award itself, this will require the matter to be arbitrated afresh under the terms of the PSC for dispute resolution.
Cairn has received advice from their Malaysian legal counsel to the effect that they have strong grounds for appeal through the Malaysian courts but, even if this proved unsuccessful, given there was one arbitration award in Cairns favour on this issue and a similar award was made in favour of one of Cairns Joint Venture partners on the same issue in a separate arbitration with GoI, Cairn believes it has a good chance of any new arbitration panel coming to the same conclusion.
In the event that the GoIs appeal ultimately succeeded and a process then ensued that concluded with the arbitration award being reversed in a manner and a forum which Cairn accepted as binding in effect by a new arbitration panel ruling in favour of GoI, then Cairn would be due to pay an additional $63.9m.
Cairn would also be potentially liable for interest on this sum currently estimated at $29.8m though the calculation of interest would require further agreement.
The ONGC Carry issue relates to whether Contractor Parties under Ravva PSC are entitled to include in their accounts for the purposes of calculating the PTRR certain costs paid by Contractor Parties in consideration for ONGC having paid 100% of costs prior to the signing of the Ravva PSC in 1994.
128 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 35.
Contingent Liabilities continued In a separate and unrelated dispute related to the profit petroleum calculations under the Ravva PSC, the Ravva JV received a claim from the Director General of Hydrocarbons DGH for approximately $166.4m representing $37.4m net to Cairn for an alleged underpayment of profit petroleum to the Indian Government, together with interest on that amount through to 30 June 2006 of $30.6m representing $6.9m net to Cairn.
This matter has now been referred to arbitration and the arbitration panel is in the process of being constituted.
This claim relates to the Indian Governments allegation that the Ravva JV has recovered costs in excess of the Base Development Costs BDC cap imposed in the PSC and that the Ravva JV has also allowed these excess costs in the calculation of the Post Tax Rate of Return PTRR.
Cairn believes that such a claim is unsustainable under the terms of the PSC because, amongst other reasons, the BDC cap only applies to the initial development of the Ravva field and not to subsequent development activities under the PSC.
Additionally the Ravva JV has also contested the basis of the calculation in the above claim from the DGH.
Even if upheld, Cairn believes that the DGH has miscalculated the sums that would be due to the Indian Government in such circumstances.
Indian Service Tax Cairn India received three show cause notices from the tax authorities in India for non-payment of service tax as a recipient of services from foreign suppliers.
These notices cover periods from 16 August 2002 to 31 March 2008.
A writ petition challenging the applicability of service tax has been filed with the Chennai High Court in respect of two such show cause notices for the period 16 August 2002 to 31 March 2007.
The reply for third show cause notice has to be filed before the authorities.
Should the adjudication go against Cairn India, it will be liable to pay the service tax of $27.6m, including related interest, although this could be recovered in part where it relates to services provided to Joint Venture of which Cairn India is operator.
Indian tax holiday on gas production Section 80-IB 9 of the Indian Income Tax Act allows the deduction of 100% of profits from the commercial production or refining of mineral oil.
The term mineral oil is not defined, but has always been understood to refer to both oil and gas, either separately or collectively.
The 2008 Indian Finance Bill appeared to remove this deduction by stating that for the purpose of section 80-IB 9, the term mineral oil does not include petroleum and natural gas, unlike in other sections of the Act.
Subsequent announcements by the Indian Finance Minister and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas have confirmed that tax holiday would be available on production of crude oil but have continued to exclude gas.
Cairn India filed a writ petition to the Gujarat High Court in December 2008 challenging the restriction of section 80-IB to the production of oil.
In the event this challenge is unsuccessful, the potential liability for tax and related interest on tax holiday claimed on gas production for all periods to 31 December 2008 is approximately $52.4m.
Guarantees It is normal practice for the Group to issue guarantees in respect of obligations during the normal course of business.
The Group had provided the following guarantees at 31 December 2008: Various guarantees under the Groups bank facilities see note 30 for the Groups share of minimum work programme commitments for the current year of $31.0m 2007: 80.0m.

Prior Year Adjustments Indian deferred tax liabilities Deferred tax liabilities relating to India have been restated to reflect the taxable temporary difference that remains at the end of the seven-year tax holiday period on the Rajasthan tangible development producing asset in two of the Groups subsidiaries.
Cairn Energy India Pty Limited had recorded deferred tax liabilities to reflect the difference between the net book value of development producing assets and, their tax written down values.
However, a liability should only have been created to recognise the taxable temporary difference on balances remaining at the end of the tax holiday period since movements in net book values and tax written down values during the tax holiday period will have no tax impact.
Inconsistencies were also identified between the deferred tax calculations of Cairn Energy India Pty Limited and those of the rest of the Group, and these have also been adjusted this also resulted in a restatement at 31 December 2007.
Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited previously had no recognised deferred tax liability recognised due to the availability of Indian tax losses.
As these losses will unwind during the tax holiday period, a taxable temporary difference will remain at the end of the tax holiday period reflecting the forecast excess of net book values over tax written down values.
A deferred tax liability should therefore have been recognised.
Fair values on acquisition of subsidiaries Fair values were assigned to the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries acquired during 2007.
Under IFRS 3, these fair values have been reassessed during the period.
