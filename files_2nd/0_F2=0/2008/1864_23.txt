In addition to the income tax expense charged to profit or loss, a current tax credit of 2.2 million 2007: credit 2.9 million and a deferred tax credit of 4.2 million 2007: credit 0.5 million has been recognised in equity in the year.
Dividends On 23 May 2008, the 2007 final dividend of 5.35p per share total dividend 22.1 million was paid to shareholders.
In May 2007, the 2006 final dividend paid was 5.0p per share total dividend 20.6 million.
On 7 November 2008, the 2008 interim dividend of 2.30p per share total dividend 9.5 million was paid to shareholders.
In November 2007, the 2007 interim dividend paid was 2.25p per share total dividend 9.3 million.
In respect of the current year, the directors propose that a final dividend of 5.30p per share will be paid to shareholders on 22 May 2009.
This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and in accordance with IAS 10 Post Balance Sheet Events has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The proposed dividend is payable to all shareholders on the Register of Members on 13 March 2009.
The total estimated dividend to be paid is 21.9 million.
The Company intends to withdraw the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and instead, subject to shareholder approval, the Company proposes to operate a Scrip Dividend Scheme which provides shareholders with the opportunity to receive their dividends in the form of new ordinary shares in the Company instead of cash.
Accompanying this report is a separate circular setting out the terms and conditions of the proposed Scrip Dividend Scheme.
Mandate forms containing elections to join the Scrip Dividend Scheme must be received by the Companys registrar no later than 23 April 2009 in order to be effective for the 2008 final dividend.
Dividend payments to minority shareholders during the year totalled 0.3 million 2007: 0.1 million.

Where a licence has an indefinite life it is not amortised but is instead subject to annual impairment review.
Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives which is on average 10 years.
The 0.3 million increase to goodwill on acquisitions in prior years 2007: 1.5 million arises as a result of the finalisation of fair value exercises.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: 2008 2007 m m Flight Support ASIG US 102.5 74.2 Signature US 215.5 109.5 Signature UK 16.3 13.7 Executive Beechcraft 26.4 19.2 Other several CGUs 33.2 25.0 Aftermarket Services & Systems Dallas Airmotive 58.1 40.1 H S Aviation 10.7 10.7 Ontic Engineering & Manufacturing 29.1 21.1 Other several CGUs 35.0 26.7 526.8 340.2 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and any risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The key assumptions used in constructing the 2009-2011 plans were that: Signature, ASIG and Engine Repair & Overhaul are impacted by a further reduction in flying activity in 2009.
A return to modest growth rates is assumed from 2010 onwards: Legacy Support continues to grow supported by new licences and its exposure to the military sector: and APPH is relatively stable with weakness in business and general aviation offset by sales on military programmes.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on an estimated growth rate of 3.0%.
This rate is well below the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
In the case of Signature US and ASIG US value in use would be broadly equal to carrying value in the event that the estimated growth rate fell to 1.0%.
With the exception of Signature US and ASIG US management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes which would result in the carrying amount of the CGUs exceeding the recoverable amounts.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10.2% which is the Groups weighted average cost of capital.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables and investments.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction of the cash flows.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

This company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group and premiums paid are held to meet future claims.
The cash balances held by the company are reported on the balance sheet within cash and cash equivalents.
As is usual practice for captive insurance companies some of this cash is used as collateral against contingent liabilities standby letters of credit that have been provided to certain external insurance companies.
The table below details the contractual amount and maturity of the cash balances that have been pledged as collateral for these contingent liabilities: 2008 2007 US Dollar Sterling Total US Dollar Sterling Total m m m m m m BBA Aviation Insurances Limited 8.5 1.0 9.5 10.2 6.0 16.2 Total 8.5 1.0 9.5 10.2 6.0 16.2 Cu rrent Less than 1 year 8.5 1.0 9.5 10.2 6.0 16.2 T otal current 8.5 1.0 9.5 10.2 6.0 16.2 T he standby letters of credit have been issued via bank facilities that BBA Aviation Insurances Limited has in place.
The amount of these facilities correspond to the amounts pledged as detailed in the table above.
The amounts pledged are usually for less than one year and are secured by a general counter indemnity and a letter of set-off in the banks standard form over the cash balances of the captive insurance company.
Derivative financial instruments continued Financial Risk Factors Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Overall our risk management policies and procedures focus on the uncertainty of financial markets and seeks to manage and minimise potential financial risks through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not undertake speculative transactions for which there is no underlying financial exposure.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors of BBA Aviation plc.
This department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with our subsidiaries.
The treasury policies cover specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
These policies are outlined further as described on page 53.
Capital Risk Management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt to equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
These borrowings, together with cash generated from the operations, are on-lent or contributed as equity to subsidiaries at market-based interest rates and on commercial terms and conditions.
The Group is subject to two main covenant requirements under its three main credit facilities: maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA of 3.5 times and minimum net interest cover of 3.0 times.
In the event of a weakening of sterling against other currencies, the Group has the ability to test the net debt to EBITDA covenant at average rates.
The Group complied with these covenants during the year.
In the primary $900 million facility the Group has the option of increasing the net debt to EBITDA covenant to 4.25 times for six months and 4.0 times for a further 12 months following a 12 month period in which it has invested more than $100 million in acquisitions in an OECD country.
After this period the covenant would return to 3.5 times.
This acquisition spike is not incorporated in the two smaller facilities.
Market Risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group has well defined policies for the management of these risks and the management of these risks includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
i Foreign Exchange Risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues, cash flows, assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in the currency of the countries in which the operations are located.
The Group is, therefore, exposed to foreign currency translation risk from the translation of these overseas operations financial statements into Sterling.
The Groups policy is not to hedge the income statement translation exposure since such hedges have only a temporary effect.
However, it is the Groups policy to maintain the majority of its debt in the currencies of our operating subsidiaries and it is the Groups policy that the foreign currency balance sheet translation risk is hedged between 50% and 85% through the use of foreign currency denominated loans, cross-currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The translation foreign exchange risk is measured by monitoring the value of the overseas net assets excluding internal group financial loans which are reported monthly as part of the management accounts reporting process and verifying these values against the net assets reported by the overseas subsidiaries within their statutory accounts.
intercompany debt post hedging effect 166.3 38.2 227.1 6.4 438.0 125.3 45.5 196.2 4.9 371.9 Excludes the fair value of the cross-currency swaps as at the year end.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective as net investment hedges amounting to a payable of 97.7 million 2007: payable 6.6 million has been deferred in equity.
The Group manages its transactional foreign currency risk by hedging significant currency exposures in accordance with foreign exchange policies that our subsidiaries have in place which have been pre-agreed between Group Treasury and the subsidiary.
Each foreign exchange policy is individually tailored to the foreign exchange exposures within the relevant subsidiary.
Transaction currency risk is managed through the use of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
All committed exposures are fully hedged 100% and where significant foreign currency exposures exist then we generally will also cover a percentage of the projected foreign currency flows depending on the certainty of these cash flows.
The transaction foreign exchange risk is measured by each subsidiary submitting monthly reports to Group Treasury which detail the foreign currency exposure reported on the balance sheet as committed exposures and, for those subsidiaries with significant foreign exchange transaction exposures, an additional report detailing the future projected foreign currency cash flows over the life of the policy.
The pre-determined policy margin is shown against the projected exposures to determine whether there is a net exposure which needs to be hedged.
If this is the case, then foreign exchange spot or forward contracts will be undertaken by Group Treasury on behalf of the relevant subsidiary with our relationship banks.

A loss of 5.5 million 2007: gain 2.1 million has been transferred to the income statement in respect of contracts that matured during the period.
Foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge foreign currency flows through the BBA Aviation plc company bank accounts and to ensure that the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management of its international cash pooling structure.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts which have not been designated as cash flow hedges amounting to 74.1 million 2007: 34.3 million have been transferred to administrative expenses in the income statement in the year.
ii Cash Flow Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Groups debt and cash balances are based on floating interest rates which expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
A very small proportion of the Groups borrowings 3.7 million is issued at fixed interest rates and, therefore, overall the Group is not exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is to use a combination of debt and derivative instruments to fix proportions of the exposure for varying periods based upon the maturity profile and the expectation of future interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to the movements on these floating interest rates.
During 2008 and 2007, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge cash flow interest rate risk as follows: 2008 2007 Fixed Floating Net Fixed Floating Net Rate Rate Debt Rate Rate Debt m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 98.4 98.4 99.2 99.2 Bank overdrafts 14.8 14.8 21.9 21.9 B orrowings 3.7 599.8 603.5 3.0 417.4 420.4 F inance leases 34.5 34.5 25.5 25.5 N et debt 3.7 550.7 554.4 3.0 365.6 368.6 Derivative effect cross-currency swaps 97.7 97.7 6.6 6.6 Derivative effect cash flow interest rate swaps 402.8 389.7 13.1 191.0 190.0 1.0 Net debt post derivative effect 406.5 258.7 665.2 194.0 182.2 376.2 Mark-to-market value has been included within the floating rate amount.
This is not booked to net debt but is recorded as a net loss in reserves.
During the year, management changed the definition of net debt to exclude the mark-to-market value of cross-currency swaps since they are excluded from the definition of net debt for covenant calculation purposes, and the directors therefore consider that this gives a better indication of the Groups financial position and performance against its key banking covenant.
This had the effect of reducing net debt in 2007 from 375.2 million to 368.6 million.
If the mark-to-market value of cross-currency swaps had been included in the definition of net debt in 2008, net debt would have been 652.1 million.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value of 13.1 million 2007: 1.0 million has been deferred in equity.
A charge of 2.8 million 2007: credit 1.7 million has been booked against hedged interest payments made in the period.
Credit Risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
As part of the Groups operations, cash management and risk management activities we are exposed to counterparty risk arising on the financial assets that we have and the credit risk on outstanding derivative financial instruments.
Treasury Related Credit Risk The Group aims to reduce counterparty risk by dealing with counterparties of strong credit standing as measured by financial credit ratings.
All Treasury related activity is concentrated with relationship banks that provide unsecured committed facilities to the Group.
Across the subsidiaries, wherever possible and where services can be provided efficiently and cost effectively, bank accounts, surplus cash and any hedging activity are concentrated and undertaken with relationship banks.
Each counterparty that we use for Treasury related activity, bank account activity and the investment of surplus cash is assigned a maximum credit limit dependent upon the counterpartys credit rating.
This limit gives a maximum permitted amount of cash and Treasury related activity that can be held or undertaken with each counterparty.
All counterparties must also have a short-term rating of A1 P1.
Deposits are generally for short-term maturity of less than three months.
Derivative financial instruments continued ii Cash Flow Interest Rate Risk continued As at 31 December 2008 and 2007 we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
These are within the maximum limits permissible under our policy and these exposures are continually monitored and reported.
No individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity and we do not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
Commercial Related Credit Risk The Groups exposure to commercial related credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables and the amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Sales to customers are settled in a number of different ways including cash, credit cards, cheques and electronic payment methods.
A customer or potential customer is assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether credit terms will be provided.
The Group does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 12.
Liquidity Risk The Group manages its liquidity requirements through the use of short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
In addition to strong cash generation in the businesses the Group maintains unsecured committed borrowing facilities from a range of highly rated banks to mitigate this risk further.
Headroom on our facilities is regularly evaluated and consistently monitored to ensure that the Group has adequate headroom and liquidity.
The Groups main facility is a $900 million facility maturing in 2012.
In 2008 the Group put in place an additional short-term $150 million facility and subsequently replaced this with a short-term $100 million facility and a three-year $175 million facility with a core group of its relationship banks.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the derivative portfolio and the proportion of derivatives hedging foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007, respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year then ended.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative instruments as cash and debt balances are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, cash and derivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the income statement: all debt is floating rate for the accrued interest part of the calculation: the floating rate leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in the interest rates affects a full 12-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: the sensitivity of foreign exchange rates only looks at the outstanding foreign exchange forward book and the currency bank account balances at BBA Aviation plc company only as at the balance sheet date and assumed this is the position for a full 12-month period: the sensitivity of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates has been used due to the fact that historically rates can move by approximately 10% per annum: and the sensitivity of a 1% movement in interest rates has been used as over the last three years floating $ interest rates have moved by on average 1% per annum.

The charges to the restructuring provision relate principally to the closure of a number of commercial cargo handling operations.
Discontinued operations represent a provision for environmental liabilities relating to businesses that have been disposed of by the Group in prior years.
The liabilities have been assessed over a remaining period of 25 years.
The provision of 19.2 million is partially offset by expected recoveries from third parties of 13.3 million 2007: 13.3 million, which are included within trade and other receivables due after one year in note 12.
Environmental provisions relate to environmental liabilities within businesses that have been acquired by the Group.
The liabilities have an expected life of up to five years.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of plans worldwide, of both the funded defined benefit type and the defined contribution type.
The normal pension cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, was 7.5 million 2007: 7.4 million of which 3.4 million 2007: 3.0 million was in respect of foreign schemes.
This includes 4.0 million 2007: 3.1 million relating to defined contribution schemes.
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, where practicable, using a variety of methods and assumptions and otherwise, in respect of certain foreign schemes, in accordance with local regulations.
The Groups main UK pension commitments are contained within a final salary defined benefit scheme with assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are made and the pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was as at 31 March 2007.
During the year, the Trustees of the UK defined benefit plan purchased from Legal & General Group plc an annuity to match the liabilities associated with pensioner members.
The annuity is an investment of the UK plan, and all pension liabilities and responsibility for future pension payments remain with the plan.
The income from the annuity will match the payments to be made to members who were pensioners at the time the annuity was purchased, and removes mortality risk in relation to those members which are the subject of the annuity purchase.
The Groups foreign pension schemes mainly relate to a number of funded final salary defined benefit pension arrangements in North America.
Pension costs have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method and assumptions appropriate to the arrangements in place.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued The Group also operates a number of plans in North America which principally cover healthcare and life assurance benefits for its retirees.
The costs of these other post-retirement benefits are assessed by independent qualified actuaries.
In accordance with IAS 19, and subject to materiality, the latest actuarial valuations of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and healthcare plan have been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2008.
The following weighted average financial assumptions have been adopted: United Kingdom North America p. a.
% 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Discount rate 6.4 5.8 5.1 6.0 6.0 5.7 Rate of increase to pensionable salaries 3.5 4.7 4.4 4.0 4.0 4.0 Price inflation 2.5 3.2 2.9 2.0 2.8 2.8 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.5 3.2 2.9 For the UK plan, the mortality assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within the plan and the assumptions also allow for future mortality improvements.
The life expectancy assumptions applying to the UK plan as at 31 December 2008 are as follows: Male Female Life expectancy for a current 65 year old years 21.2 22.0 Life expectancy for a 65 year old in 15 years years 23.1 23.2 For the US post-retirement medical plan, the immediate trend rate for medical benefits was 9.5%, which is assumed to reduce by 0.5% per annum to 5% in 2018 onwards.
In accordance with IAS 19, IFRIC 14 and the Groups accounting policies, the surplus has been restricted and no asset has been recognised in the balance sheet, as any economic benefit or recovery via refund or reduction in future contributions is not sufficiently certain.
The funding policy for the United Kingdom and majority of the North American schemes is reviewed on a systematic basis in consultation with the independent scheme actuary in order to ensure that the funding contributions from sponsoring employers are appropriate to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term.
Included within other receivables in the balance sheet are 4.0 million 2007: 3.6 million of listed investments which are held in trust for the benefit of members of the North American schemes.
These amounts are not included within the assets shown in the table above as they are not controlled by the pension schemes in question.
A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rates on the UK plan would increase the net surplus by 6.4 million.
A 0.25% increase in the assumed discount rate on the UK plan would change the position from a 5.1 million net surplus to a 1.6 million net deficit.
Similar changes to discount rates on the US schemes would not have a material impact on the net deficit position.

The long-term rates of return on bonds and other investments are set in line with market yields available at the balance sheet date.
The long-term rate of return on equities is derived from considering current risk free rates of return with the addition of a future risk premium.
The overall expected return on assets in the analysis of the income statement is based on weighted average returns using the above rates for each asset class, and taking into account the asset allocation in each plan.
Included within Other returns in 2008 for the UK scheme are the expected returns on the Legal & General insurance annuity.
These are set by reference to the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the corresponding defined benefit obligation.

These assets have not been recognised as the precise incidence of future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be accurately predicted at this time.
Included in the unrecognised deferred tax asset is 0.3 million 2007: 0.1 million relating to losses due to expire in 2012 which relates to losses which will expire by 2012.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely under current tax legislation.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 36.6 million 2007: 2.5 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.

Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based payments i Share options The Group plan provides for a grant price equal to the average of the middle market price of a BBA Aviation plc share up to five dealing days prior to the date of grant.
The vesting period is generally three to four years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows: 2008 2007 Weighted Weighted Number average Number average of share exercise of share exercise options price options price Outstanding at the beginning of the year 10,184,446 258p 13,556,246 275p Granted during the year 1,124,790 202p E xercised during the year 22,600 153p 1,217,312 225p L apsed during the year 2,158,062 278p 3,279,278 308p O utstanding at the end of the year 8,003,784 253p 10,184,446 258p E xercisable at the end of the year 7,259,995 258p 6,308,200 167p T he weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 166p.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2008 had weighted average remaining contractual life of 59 months and an exercise price range of 1.53 to 4.85.
No options were granted during the year.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted and calculated using the valuation technique most appropriate to each type of award.
These include Black-Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.
The inputs into the models were as follows: 2008 2007 Issued in Issued in March 2003 Others March 2003 Others Weighted average share price pence 153 271 153 269 Weighted average exercise price pence 153 184 153 247 E xpected volatility 12.0% 20.3% 12.9% 20.7% E xpected life months 10 25 11 26 R isk-free rate 4.1% 4.7% 4.0% 4.7% E xpected dividends 4.5% 3.4% 4.6% 3.4% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the period of time equivalent to the remaining contractual life of the option.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Other share-based payment plan The Companys savings-related share option scheme is open to all eligible UK employees.
Options are granted at a price equal to the average three-day middle market price of a BBA Aviation plc ordinary share prior to the date of grant, less 20%.
Options are granted under three or five-year SAYE contracts.
The maximum overall employee contribution is 250 per month.
Pursuant to this plan, the Group issued nil ordinary shares in 2008 2007: 101,219 shares.
ii Conditional shares Details of the conditional share awards outstanding during the year are as follows: 2008 2007 Number Number of shares of shares Outstanding at the beginning of the year 5,017,995 2,660,200 Granted during the year 4,341,219 2,515,800 Vested during the year 95,833 Lapsed during the year 731,569 158,005 Outstanding at the end of the year 8,531,812 5,017,995 The awards outstanding at 31 December 2008 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 64 months.
The weighted average fair value of conditional shares granted in the year was 106p.
Share-based payments continued The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted and calculated using the valuation technique most appropriate to each type of award.
The inputs into the model were as follows: 2008 2007 Issued in Issued in March 2008 Others March 2007 Others Weighted average share price at issue pence 174 278 251 258 Expected volatility 24.0% 21.4% 19.8% 18.8% Expected life months 27 9 24 13 Risk-free rate 3.8% 5.0% 4.6% 4.4% Expected dividend yield 4.4% 3.9% 3.4% 3.6% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the period of time equivalent to the remaining contractual life of the option.
iii Expense charged to income statement The Group recognised total expenses of 1.5 million 2007: 2.0 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
iv Cash-settled share-based payments The Group issues to certain employees share appreciation rights SARs that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the SAR to the employee at the date of exercise.
The fair value of the SARs is determined using the valuation technique most appropriate to each type of award.
These include Black-Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo simulations and use the assumptions noted in the above tables.
The Group has recorded liabilities of 0.1 million 2007: 0.9 million and a total credit of 0.8 million 2007: credit 1.1 million.
The total intrinsic value of vested SARs at 31 December 2008 was nil 2007: nil.

Fiberweb was demerged and Becorit was sold in 2006.
Purchase of intangible assets excludes 21.9 million 2007: 2.5 million paid in relation to Ontic licences since the directors believe these payments are more akin to expenditure in relation to acquisitions, and are therefore outside of the Groups definition of free cash flow.
These amounts are included within purchase of intangible assets on the face of the cash flow statement.
Free cash flow for 2007 has been restated to reflect the above change in definition.
Disposal of a subsidiary Oxford Aviation Training and Oxford Airport On 29 June 2007 the Group disposed of its interest in Oxford Aviation Training and on 19 July 2007 disposed of its interest in Oxford Airport.
The net assets of these businesses at the date of disposal were as follows: Oxford Aviation Training Oxford Airport 29 June 19 July 2007 2007 m m Intangible assets 11.8 2.4 Property, plant and equipment 8.1 16.3 Inventories 0.3 0.1 Trade and other receivables 2.7 2.1 Trade and other payables 12.1 1.0 Tax liabilities 0.4 0.6 10.4 19.3 Disposal costs 1.8 1.2 Gain on disposal 19.8 18.6 32.0 39.1 Satisfied by: Cash 32.0 39.1 Net cash inflow arising on disposal: Cash consideration received 32.0 39.1 Bank overdrafts, loans, finance leases and cash and cash equivalents disposed of on disposal 32.0 39.1 In total, Oxford Aviation Training and Oxford Airport contributed 2.0 million to operating profit in 2007.
Acquisition of subsidiary undertakings The Group made a number of acquisitions during the year which are detailed in the Directors Report on page 54.
The directors have performed an exercise to establish the provisional fair value of the assets and liabilities of these acquisitions.
The net assets acquired and the goodwill arising on these acquisitions are as set out below: Adjustments Provisional to align fair value Book Fair value accounting to BBA Value adjustments policies Aviation m m m m Intangible assets 21.6 21.6 Property, plant and equipment 5.3 5.3 Inventories 0.7 0.7 Receivables 0.8 0.8 Payables 3.3 3.3 Net borrowings 0.5 0.5 Net assets 4.0 21.6 25.6 Goodwill 53.0 Total consideration including deferred consideration 78.6 Deferred consideration 2.2 Net cash consideration paid in 2008 76.4 The fair values set out above are provisional and may be subject to amendment on finalisation of the fair value exercises.
In the period since acquisition to 31 December 2008, the revenue from acquisitions was 13.7 million and profit for the year was 1.0 million.
The acquisitions noted above contributed 0.3 million to the Groups net operating cash flows, paid nil million in respect of net returns on investment and servicing of finance, paid nil million in respect of taxation, paid 0.1 million in respect of capital expenditure and utilised nil million for investing activities.
If the acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2008, total revenue for the period from acquisitions would have been approximately 30 million, and profit for the year would have been approximately 2 million.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability arising from the expansion of the Groups FBO network, together with anticipated future operating synergies.
105 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 27.
Contingent liabilities The Group is party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business, including specific product liability and environmental claims.
Any liabilities are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance, reserves and third party indemnities.
Additionally, the Group has previously owned businesses that manufactured products containing asbestos.
No Group company has manufactured or sold any products or materials containing asbestos for many years.
A small number of former Group companies have been named as defendants to asbestos-related claims.
When these companies were sold, the Group retained certain obligations to indemnify the purchasers against such claims.
Notwithstanding such indemnity arrangements, the costs incurred by the Group in dealing with claims made against these former Group companies have been immaterial.
During the period 1989 to 31 December 2008, the Groups costs of defending and disposing of all asbestos-related claims, net of insurance coverage, were approximately 5.6 million.
The Group maintains a portfolio of insurance coverage in respect of the majority of such claims, including legal defence costs and liability cover.
State operated compensation programmes have also provided coverage.
On the basis of its past claims experience, the Group does not anticipate any material increase in the cost to it of resolving such claims.
Whilst the outcome of these claims are, by their nature, uncertain, the directors do not currently anticipate that the outcome of the proceedings and claims set out above either individually, or in aggregate, will materially exceed the insurance coverage or amounts provided as shown in note 18, and are not expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
Related party transactions Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
Details of transactions between the Group and other related parties are detailed below.
Compensation of key management personnel The remuneration of directors and other members of key management during the year was as follows: 2008 2007 m m Short-term benefits 4.1 4.7 Post-employment benefits 0.5 1.1 Termination benefits 0.4 Share-based payments 0.2 0.2 4.4 6.0 Post-employment benefits include contributions of 0.3 million 2007: 0.9 million in relation to defined contribution schemes.
The remuneration of directors and key executives is determined by the remuneration committee having regard to the performance of individuals and market trends.
The directors remuneration is disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 69.
Related party transactions continued Other related party transactions During the prior year a subsidiary provided services to a company controlled by a person who is a close family member of Roberto Quarta, a director of BBA Aviation plc in 2007.
These were provided in the ordinary course of business and on an arms length basis and amounted to 15,641.
At 31 December 2007 nil remained unpaid.
During the year, Group companies entered into the following transactions with related parties who are not members of the Group: Sales of Goods Purchases of Goods Amounts owed by Amounts owed to related parties related parties 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m m m m m Associates 2.6 1.8 129.0 81.1 0.5 0.5 5.5 8.0 Purchases were made at market price discounted to reflect the quantity of goods purchased and the relationships between the parties.

No guarantees have been given or received.
At the balance sheet date, Group companies had loan receivables from an associated undertaking of 1.5 million 2007: 1.3 million.
