QXD 5 3 09 09:21 Page 109 Company financial statements Significant accounting policies for the year ended 31 December 2008 Fixed asset investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Fixed assets and depreciation No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
On other assets, depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation of fixed assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold property 2% per annum Plant, machinery and equipment Between 10% and 33% per annum Taxation The tax expense represents the current tax and deferred tax charges.
Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.
a Current tax Current tax is the Companys expected tax liability on taxable profit for the year using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit differs from that reported in the profit and loss account because it is adjusted for items of income or expense that are assessable or deductible in other years and is adjusted for items that are never assessable or deductible.
b Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and laws.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be future taxable profits against which to recover carried forward future tax losses and from which the reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Retirement benefit schemes The Company has two retirement benefit plans.
a Defined contribution plan A defined contribution plan is a post-retirement benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions to a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
The Company recognises payments to defined contribution pension plans as an employee expense in the profit and loss account as and when they are due.
b Defined benefit plan A defined benefit plan is a post-retirement plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Companys net liability is recognised in the balance sheet and is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods and discounting this to its present value.
Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of the plans assets are deducted.
QXD 9 3 09 15:14 Page 110 Morgan Sindall Report and Accounts 2008 Significant accounting policies for the year ended 31 December 2008 b Defined benefit plan continued The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary on an annual basis using the projected unit credit method.
The cost of the plan is charged to the profit and loss account based on actuarial assumptions at the beginning of the financial year.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the asset recognised is limited to the net of the total unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
When the benefits of the plan are improved, the portion of increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Where the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the combined statement of movements in reserves and shareholders funds in the period in which they occur.
Net pension obligations are included in the balance sheet at the present value of the plan liabilities, less the fair value of the plan assets and any related deferred tax asset.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-Based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company grants equity-settled and cash-settled share-based awards to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and are recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period from date of grant to the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
Cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date and recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period from date of grant to the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the payment.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as an employee expense or income in the profit and loss account.
Fair value is measured by use of a modified Black-Scholes model.
None of these awards when granted were subject to a share price related performance condition.
Related National Insurance Contributions are accrued on the basis of the intrinsic value of outstanding share-based payments and are re-measured at each reporting date.
QXD 5 3 09 09:21 Page 111 Company financial statements Significant accounting policies for the year ended 31 December 2008 Leased assets Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Finance income and expense Finance income comprises bank and other interest.
Interest income is recognised in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
Finance expense comprises interest on bank overdrafts.
Borrowing costs are recognised in the profit and loss account on an effective interest method in the period in which they are incurred.
Financial guarantees The Company provides certain guarantees in respect of the indebtedness of its subsidiary undertakings and in respect of bonds and claims under contracting and other arrangements which include joint arrangements and joint ventures entered into in the ordinary course of business.
The Company considers such agreements to be indemnity arrangements and as such, accounts for them as contingent liabilities unless it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Dividends The Company has adopted FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date and accordingly only recognises a liability once there is an obligation to pay.
As a result a dividend will only be recognised once the shareholders approve it.
QXD 9 3 09 15:41 Page 112 Morgan Sindall Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 1 Employees The average number of people employed by the Company including directors during the year was 21 2007: 20.

The accrual is re-measured at each reporting period on the basis of the intrinsic value of share-based payments.
3 Profit loss of the parent company The Company has taken advantage of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and consequently the profit and loss account of the parent company is not presented as part of these accounts.
The profit of the parent company for the financial year amounted to 50.5m 2007: a loss of 5.5m.

Retirement benefit schemes 7 Defined contribution plan The Morgan Sindall Retirement Benefits Plan the Plan was established on 31 May 1995 and operates on defined contribution principles for employees of the Group.
The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the Trustees of the Plan.
The total cost charged to income of 0.3m 2007: 0.5m represents contributions payable to the defined contribution section of the Plan by the Company at rates specified in the Plan rules.
As at 31 December 2008, contributions of 0.1m 2007: 0.1m were due in respect of December 2008s contribution which had not been paid over to the Plan.
The Company, with the consent of the Trustees, can decide how to use monies held in a defined contribution general account.
During the year, the Company made contributions of 0.7m 2007: 0.2m in respect of the Plan.
Defined benefits plan The Plan includes some defined benefit liabilities and transfers of funds representing the accrued benefit rights of former active and deferred members and pensioners of pension plans of companies which are now part of the Group.
These include final salary related benefits for members in respect of benefits accrued before 31 May 1995 and benefits transferred in from The Snape Group Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme include accruals up to 1 August 1997.
No further defined benefit membership rights can accrue after that date.
Under the Plan, employees are entitled to retirement benefits at a retirement age of 65.
No other retirement benefits are provided.
The Plan is currently being funded by the Company.
The last triennial valuation of the Plan was undertaken on 5 April 2007 and was prepared using assumptions of a rate of investment return of 6.0% per annum, a rate of earnings escalation of 4.5% per annum and rate of inflation of 3.5% per annum.
The ongoing liabilities of the Plan were assessed using the projected unit method whereas the assets were taken at realisable market value.
The actuarial valuation referred to showed that the defined benefit liabilities were partly funded and, on an ongoing basis, the value of the assets of 4.7m represented 59% of the value of these liabilities.
The actuarial valuation also showed that the realisable market value of the Plans assets was 81% of its minimum liabilities when assessed on the Minimum Funding Requirement basis as defined in the Pensions Act 1995.
The next triennial valuation will be carried out as at 5 April 2010 when the funding position will be re-appraised.
The most recent valuation of the Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit liabilities was as at 31 December 2008.
The present value of the defined benefit liabilities, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit method.
