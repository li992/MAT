22 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Companys investing activities undertaken in pursuit of its investment objective as set out on page 1 involve certain inherent risks.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below.
These policies have remained substantially unchanged during the current and preceding periods.
Market price risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets on seven scheduled occasions in each year and at each meeting it receives sufficient financial and statistical information to enable it to monitor adequately the investment performance and status of the business.
In addition, financial information is circulated to the directors on a monthly basis.
The Board has also established a series of investment parameters, which are reviewed annually, designed to limit the risk inherent in managing a portfolio of investments.
The Companys borrowings have the effect of increasing the risk faced by shareholders.
This gearing effect is such that, for example, for a 10% movement in the valuation of the Companys investments, the net assets attributable to shareholders would move by approximately 11.3%.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments that arise as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
The Company finances its operations through retained profits including realised and unrealised capital profits, and additional financing is obtained through the two debenture stocks in issue, on which interest is paid at a fixed rate.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of cash balances and short term bank deposits.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.
This is mitigated by the Investment Manager reviewing the credit ratings of broker counterparties.
The risk attached to dividend flows is mitigated by the Investment Managers research of potential investee companies.
The Companys custodian bank is responsible for the collection of income on behalf of the Company.
Cash is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit enhancements.
Currency risk The income and capital value of the Companys investments and liabilities can be affected by exchange rate movements as some of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than Sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The key areas where foreign currency risk could have an impact on the Company are: movement in rates affect the value of investments and liabilities: movements in rates affect the income received: and movements in rates affect short term timing differences.

The weighted average running yield as at 31 December 2008 was 7.22% 2007: 4.18% and the weighted average remaining life was 3.6 years 2007: 1.4 years.
The Companys cash balances of 14,347,000 2007: 3,412,000 earn interest calculated by reference to LIBOR.
All of the Companys assets are denominated in Sterling.
If the bank base rate had increased by 0.5%, the impact on the profit or loss would have been a positive 71,735 2007: 17,060.
If the bank base rate had decreased by 0.5%, the impact on the profit or loss would have been a negative 71,735 2007: negative 17,060.
The calculations are based on the cash balances at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Financial liabilities Interest rate risk All of the Companys financial liabilities of 63,853,000 2007: 66,456,000 are denominated in Sterling.
All current liabilities have no interest rate, and are repayable within one year.
The 9.875% debenture stock and the 5.5% debenture stock, which are repayable in 2017 and 2021 respectively, pay interest at fixed rates.
The weighted average period until maturity of the debenture stocks is 11 years 2007: 12 years and the weighted average interest rate payable is 7.2% 2007: 7.2% per annum.
The Company also has recourse to a 25m overdraft facility with HSBC Bank.
Other price risk exposure If the investment valuation fell by 10% at 31 December 2008, the impact on the profit or loss would have been negative 38.2m 2007: negative 52.6m.
If the investment portfolio valuation rose by 10% at 31 December 2008, the impact on the profit and loss would have been positive 38.2m 2007: positive 52.6m.
The calculations are based on the portfolio valuation as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
The Company held the following categories of financial instruments, all of which are included in the balance sheet at fair value, with the exception of interest bearing borrowings which are shown at book value at 31 December 2008.
