The acquired subsidiary companies are now dormant.
Acquisitions made in the periods under review are not material to the Group in respect of turnover, profits or cashflows.
Therefore, the results and cash flows of the Group, prepared on the basis that the acquisitions were made on 1 January 2008, are not disclosed on the grounds of materiality.
The individual turnovers, results and cash flow effects of the acquired businesses are not sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure.
The acquired branches have now been fully integrated into the Travis Perkins group accounting systems.
As such, the Directors are unable to calculate meaningful cash flow effects of each of the acquired businesses for the period of Travis Perkins ownership without incurring undue expense and delay.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions The goodwill arising on acquisitions made during the year is attributable to the anticipated profitability of these acquisitions and the future operating synergies arising in the enlarged group.
No intangible assets were acquired during the year.
Prior period acquisitions The provisional fair values ascribed to the net assets of acquisitions made during 2007 and disclosed in the 2007 financial statements were finalised during the year.
There were no significant changes to the values disclosed last year.
