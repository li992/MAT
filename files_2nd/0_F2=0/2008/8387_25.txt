These are principally attributable to exchange differences on the Groups non-sterling denominated currency borrowings, held in companies whose functional currency is sterling.
Of the exchange losses, 19 million arose on net external euro borrowings.
These foreign currency borrowings were held as an economic hedge by reference to the Groups underlying cash generation by currency.
However, they are not accounted for as net investment hedges under IAS 39 and consequently exchange differences arising on these borrowings are recorded in the income statement.

An analysis of the carrying amount of goodwill by primary business segment is set out below.
Certain business segments comprise a number of CGUs.
2008 2007 m m Process Systems 69 58 Eurotherm 112 105 Controls 34 35 Continuing operations 215 198 APV 4 Controls Reversing Valves 3 Rail Group Burco 1 Discontinued operations 8 215 206 1 Included in disposal of subsidiaries are assets with a net book value of 7 million classified as held for sale in the half-yearly financial statements.
86 Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2008 Annual impairment test The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of each of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations using cash flow projections over a five year period.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are: revenue volumes: revenue prices: operating costs: growth rate assumptions for years four and five of the cash flow projections: growth in perpetuity applied to calculate the terminal value: and discount rate.
Expected revenue volumes, revenue prices and operating costs are based on past experience and expected future developments in markets and operations and are the same assumptions used in the most recent financial annual operating plans approved by management.
These projections cover the first three years of the cash flow projections.
Cash flows for years four and five are projected at a growth rate appropriate for the relevant CGU.
These growth rates take into consideration forecast GDP growth rates for the countries of operation, expected market growth rates for those regions and the levels of growth achieved historically by the CGU and forecast in the periods covered by the annual operating plan.
Lower growth rates are applied in perpetuity to calculate the terminal value for each CGU.
These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The discount rate applied to each CGU is a pre-tax rate based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect managements estimate of the specific risk profile associated with the cash flow projections for the CGU.
These discount rates and growth rates by CGU are as follows: Discount Growth Discount Growth 1 1 rate rate rate rate 2008 2008 2007 2007 % %%% Process Systems 2 IPS 11.73 3.6 13.70 3.6 Wonderware 11.73 3.2 13.70 3.1 Eurotherm 12.09 2.9 14.95 2.8 Controls Appliance and Climate Controls 10.97 1.5 11.54 2.0 IMServ 10.97 1.5 12.55 1.5 1 In perpetuity.
2 CGUs in IPS have been revised to reflect changes in the organisation and reporting structure since April 2007.
In all cases the recoverable amounts of these CGUs were in excess of their carrying values and no impairment arose in the year 2007: nil.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With respect to the assessment of value in use of all CGUs management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount.

Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 40 million 2007: 43 million that will expire within four years.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on temporary differences of 306 million with a tax value of 105 million 2007: 525 million with a tax value of 173 million in respect of pension and other retirement benefit obligations and other deductible temporary differences.
The above tax values include the impact of changes in tax rates in various territories.
The Group has unrecognised capital losses of 1,966 million 2007: 2,144 million that are only available for offset against future capital gains.
Included in capital losses are losses of 1,401 million 2007: 1,384 million that will expire within four years.
Other capital losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to 998 million 2007: 830 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
16 Other financial assets 2008 2007 m m Available-for-sale investments 11 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: held for trading 66 77 Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets consist of investments in listed ordinary shares and therefore have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss The investments included above represent investments in unlisted securities that offer the Group the opportunity for return through fair value gains.
The securities have final maturity dates between 2010 and 2020, but will be redeemed earlier should the Nikkei Index achieve specified target levels.
Market values have been determined by external security dealers using pricing models, based on various financial factors including bond prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and the Nikkei Index prices.
The total amount of the change in fair value estimated using a valuation technique that was recognised in the income statement during the year was 1 million 2007: nil.

These loans and borrowings are secured by fixed and floating charges over certain Group companies assets.
1 million 2007: 1 million of such loans are classified as current liabilities.
The borrowers have the right to prepay these facilities at par on five days notice.
The lenders have the right to seek early repayment following any Event of Default or Change of Control.
These facilities carry maintenance covenants that include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings, a minimum level of interest cover and a maximum level of capital expenditure.
The covenants measure these as a number and must show performance better than a defined scale, which changes over the period of the facilities.
To date the Group has shown ratios better than those required by the relevant agreements.
Failure to satisfy these covenants would allow the lenders to call for immediate repayment of loans made to the Group.
These loans were repaid in full on 7 May 2008 Note 34.

The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily forward currency contracts.
This note explains the nature and extent of the risks arising from financial instruments: how those risks arise: the objectives, policies and processes used by the Group for managing the risks: and the methods used to measure the risks.
Overview of treasury policy The Group manages its exposure to risks arising from its use of financial instruments by the application of its treasury policy.
The Groups treasury policy is approved by the Board and seeks to ensure that: appropriate financial resources are available for the maintenance and development of the Groups businesses: the financial risk of currency, interest rate and counterparty credit exposure is optimised: and treasury operates as a cost centre and no speculative transactions are undertaken.
Further details of the treasury policy are included in the Financial Review section of the Annual Report.
Policy in respect of the major areas of treasury management is set out below.
There have been no significant changes in the Groups exposures to risk, and its approach to managing those exposures, in the year ended 31 March 2008 compared to the year ended 31 March 2007.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to risk arising from the effect of changes in floating interest rates on the level of interest it pays on its borrowings and receives on its cash deposits.
The Groups policy is to set the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt, taking into account several factors including: the profitability of the Group in relation to the business cycle and the consequent level of interest rates in relation to that business cycle: the absolute levels of interest rates: and the financial leverage of the Group.
To implement this policy the Group uses fixed-rate borrowings, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and currency swaps to manage its interest rate exposure.
As at 31 March 2008, in line with the Group being in a net cash position, Invensys had no significant fixed rate borrowings 2007: 431 million, including interest rate swaps representing 260% of net debt and 89% of gross debt.
The interest rate profiles of the Groups cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term borrowings are set out in Notes 20 and 21 respectively.
The Groups interest rate swaps are set out on page 98.
All other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are non-interest bearing and a statement has been made to that effect in the relevant balance sheet notes.
Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2008 93 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate cash and borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
The same assumptions have been used for the years ended 31 March 2008 and 2007.
Effect on profit Effect on profit before tax: before tax: increase increase Increase decrease decrease decrease in base 2008 2007 points m m Euro 100 0.1 0.2 US dollar 100 0.7 0.2 Euro 100 0.1 0.2 US dollar 100 0.7 0.2 Currency risk Translation exposure The majority of the Groups operating capital is employed in overseas locations and is denominated in foreign currencies, particularly US dollars and Euros.
As a consequence, changes in exchange rates affect both net asset values and reported results.
This risk is not hedged directly but debt which is held in foreign currency reduces the level of net assets exposed to currency fluctuations.
The interest expense of foreign currency debt may also reduce the level of earnings exposed to exchange rate movements.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows: US dollar Euro Other excl GBP US dollar Euro Other excl GBP 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 As at 31 March m m m m m m Net assets of non-GBP functional currency entities 157 13 189 27 146 273 Net unhedged monetary assets not held in entities 54 97 81 103 263 13 functional currencies Gross exposure 211 110 270 130 409 260 The significant exchange rates that applied during the year are set out in Note 35.
Currency risk sensitivity analysis The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar and Euro exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of: the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the sterling value of monetary assets and liabilities not held in entities functional currencies assuming year end levels of such items are held constant : the Groups equity due to changes in the sterling value of year end net assets held by non-GBP functional currency entities.

The incidence of this risk varies across the Group and is subject to change.
Usually however, the majority of revenues and costs will be in the functional currency of the business unit undertaking the transaction.
Where this is not the case and the exposure is significant, it is the Groups policy for businesses to hedge their exposure.
The Group is also subject to exchange risk in making bids, particularly on major contracts.
The assumption of a specific exchange rate within a bid would lead to a change in the anticipated margin on the contract should a bid be successful: this risk is hedged if significant.
The Group predominantly uses forward currency contracts to manage transaction exposure.
94 Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2008 Price risk The Groups exposure to changing market prices on the value of financial instruments has an impact on the carrying value of financial assets that are classified as available-for-sale and on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group monitors changes in the carrying amounts of these assets and any resulting change in exposure to price risk in order to ensure that its investment in these assets remains appropriate.
On 31 March 2008, the total carrying value of these financial assets was 7 million 2007: 7 million of which 6 million 2007: 6 million related to investments in unlisted securities as described in Note 16 and set out below.
Interest Final Nikkei Interest payment maturity index Amount invested at cost Face amount Start date rate date date target JPY 500 million 2.9 million 1 Mar 2000 0.05% 1 Mar, 1 Sep 1 Mar 2010 18,180 JPY 1,000 million 5.9 million 29 Mar 2000 0.05% 29 Mar, 29 Sep 29 Mar 2020 20,500 The face amount is receivable if the Nikkei index target is reached on or in the five days preceding any interest payment date up to and including the final maturity date.
In the case of the JPY 1,000 million debenture, the face amount is receivable on the final maturity date irrespective of the level of the Nikkei index on that date.
For the JPY 500 million debenture, if the Nikkei index has not reached its target by the final maturity date, the amount receivable at that date is based on the level of the Nikkei index at that date compared to its level of 1 March 2000.
Counterparty risk The Group is exposed to risk if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Such a risk arises principally in relation to receivables due from customers and cash deposited with banks or other financial institutions.
The Group monitors the identity of the counterparties with whom it deposits cash and transacts other financial instruments so as to control exposure to any territory or institution.
As far as it is both feasible and practical to do so, cash is held centrally by treasury.
Risk is assessed using ratings from major credit rating agencies.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their respective carrying values as at the balance sheet date see i on page 97. Credit risks arising from acting as guarantor are disclosed in Note 30.
There are no significant concentrations of counterparty risk within the Group.
Details of collateral held as security and other credit enhancements in respect of receivables are given in Note 19.
Based on past experience, the directors believe that there is no significant credit risk associated with receivables that are neither past due nor impaired.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties, and performs credit verification procedures on all customers.
The Group has not renegotiated the terms of any significant financial assets such that those assets would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
Operating within the strict controls of the Groups treasury policy, the treasury department manages this risk, ensuring that sufficient funding and liquidity is available to meet the expected needs of the Group.
In addition to the free cash flow of the Group, Invensys adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management using a mixture of long-term debt facilities and short-term cash deposits.
Core funding and guarantee issuance is provided by bank facilities maturing in December 2010.

Capital management The facilities at 31 March 2008 provide liquidity for the Group until December 2010 and support the objectives of the Group.
These are described further in Note 21 ii.
Investigations are continually undertaken to review alternative financing arrangements.
In making those considerations the Board takes into account the cost of any refinancing compared to the benefits, which include both the cost of funding as well as longer repayment schedules.
There were no significant changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the years ended 31 March 2008 and 2007.
The Groups capital structure is as follows: 2008 2007 As at 31 March m m Capital employed 373 26 Cash and cash equivalents 235 307 Borrowings 162 473 Net cash debt 73 166 Total equity funds deficit 446 140 Comprising: Equity holders of parent 377 200 Minority interests 69 60 446 140 As at 31 March 2008, Invensys had a significant deficit on distributable reserves and, accordingly, the Company is currently unable to pay dividends.
As part of its approach to managing capital, the Group is considering available options to optimise further the structure of its debt and create sufficient distributable reserves to allow dividend payments in the future.
Net cash increased to 73 million during the year from net debt of 166 million at 31 March 2007, a 311 million reduction in gross debt partially offset by a 72 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents.
The principal component of the reduction in gross debt was the redemption of the High Yield Bonds which was funded by ongoing free cash flow together with proceeds from the sale of APV and other businesses in the year to 31 March 2008.
96 Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2008 i Classification and fair values of financial assets and liabilities The following table sets out the classification, carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates translated at year end exchange rates.
Provisions have been included where there is a contractual obligation to settle in cash.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities at 31 March was: Book Fair Book Fair value value value value 2008 2008 2007 2007 Notes m m m m Financial assets Available-for-sale investments 16 1 1 1 1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: held for trading 16 6 6 6 6 1 Loans and receivables: Trade and other receivables 19 501 501 519 519 1 Cash and cash equivalents 20 235 235 307 307 Derivative financial instruments: Interest rate swaps 22ii 1 1 Foreign exchange swaps and forwards 22ii 1 1 1 1 744 744 835 835 Financial liabilities Long-term bank and other loans 21 161 161 472 509 Finance leases 30 1 1 1 1 1 Provisions 24 29 29 43 43 1 Trade and other payables 26 437 437 559 559 Derivative financial instruments: Foreign exchange swaps and forwards 22ii 1 1 1 1 629 629 1,076 1,113 1 The directors consider that the carrying amount of these financial assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.
The Group has, in the ordinary course of business, provided indemnities to banks in respect of performance guarantees issued to customers.
The fair value of such indemnities is not material as the likelihood of any liability arising from them is considered remote.
In a very limited number of cases, the Group has guaranteed certain borrowings by third parties.
At 31 March 2008, the maximum credit risk to the Group arising from these guarantees was 3 million 2007: 4 million, being the total amount of such borrowings outstanding at that date.
Financial assets with a carrying value of up to 156 million 2007: 148 million are subject to charges relating to such loans.

Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge transaction exposure The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to hedge currency exposure arising from sales and purchases made by the Groups businesses in currencies other than their own functional currency.
The turnover i. e. notional principal of such derivatives which typically have a term of less than one year, excluding swaps, in the year to 31 March 2008 was 421 million 2007: 255 million and their fair value at 31 March was: Fair Fair value value 2008 2007 m m Derivative assets 11 Derivative liabilities 1 1 All of these instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges.

Warranties are provided for in the normal course of business based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past claims.
Such costs are generally incurred over the product life cycle.
The actual amount of costs that will be incurred will depend upon the level and nature of future claims.
Restructuring provisions cover committed costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount can be determined reliably.
This generally coincides with a commitment to a formal plan or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites.
These costs are expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
Provisions for onerous contracts relate to lease rentals in respect of vacant property and the costs of other onerous contracts.
An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
The provisions represent the best estimate of the unavoidable costs remaining under the current contractual terms of the contracts.
These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next fifteen years.
Other provisions principally relate to legal claims, claims under workers compensation or similar employee disability benefit schemes and other miscellaneous obligations.
These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next five years.
The costs are estimated based on the expected outcome of the legal claim or obligation.
The amount of the final liability and timing of payment, if any, is dependent upon the final outcome of any litigation or other negotiation involved.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of provisions equates to their fair value.
100 Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2008 25 Pensions and post-retirement benefits i Defined contribution schemes The Group operates many defined contribution schemes.
Pension costs in respect of defined contribution schemes represented contributions payable in the year and amounted to 11 million 2007: 8 million.
At 31 March 2008, there were 1 million 2007: 1 million of outstanding contributions included in payables.
ii Defined benefit schemes general The Group operates many funded and unfunded defined benefit pension and post-retirement schemes.
Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of the independent actuary of the relevant scheme.
There are two main funded defined benefit schemes in the UK and US, together with other smaller schemes in the rest of the world.
The principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees is the Invensys Pension Scheme.
The Invensys Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme.
The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
These assets are managed by trustees, who are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The Trustee Board is made up of nine directors, four nominated by the Company and five by the members.
The Company is responsible for appointing the Chairman from the Board.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme for funding purposes was carried out with a valuation date of 30 September 2005 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method for valuing the liabilities.
The assumptions that had the most effect on the results of this valuation for funding purposes are those relating to the discount rate and inflation on scheme liabilities and mortality assumptions.
There are numerous schemes operated by overseas subsidiaries.
Of these the largest US scheme is assessed annually by an actuary, and the other overseas defined benefit schemes are normally assessed periodically by independent actuaries in accordance with local practice.
The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired former employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
These schemes are generally unfunded.
The last full valuations of all schemes on an IAS 19 basis have been updated to 31 March 2008 to reflect market conditions and material events in the plans.
iii Defined benefit schemes major assumptions The major assumptions made when valuing the liabilities of funded and unfunded schemes under IAS 19 are as follows: For March 2008 the major financial assumptions were: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Invensys Pension Pension US 1 Scheme UK Plan US Other healthcare Other %%%%% Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.95 4.00 3.81 1.48 2 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.80 2.78 1.11 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 6.10 6.55 6.07 6.55 5.93 Inflation rate 3.70 2.50 3.10 2.17 For March 2007 the major financial assumptions were: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Invensys Pension Pension US 1 Scheme UK Plan US Other healthcare Other %%%%% Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.45 4.00 3.91 1.44 2 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.50 2.41 0.94 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.35 5.95 5.30 5.95 5.36 Inflation rate 3.20 2.50 2.74 2.10 For March 2006 the major financial assumptions were: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Invensys Pension Pension US 1 Scheme UK Plan US Other healthcare Other %%%%% Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.15 4.00 3.63 2.47 2 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.35 1.91 1.68 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.95 6.05 5.11 6.05 4.76 Inflation rate 2.90 2.50 2.26 2.16 1 The assumptions used for medical trend rates for beneficiaries of the US healthcare scheme were 9.5% per annum, declining to an ultimate rate of 5.0% in 2008 2007 and 2006: 9.0% declining to 5.0%.
2 The inflationary pension increases granted for the UK scheme in the year were 3.70% 2007: 3.20%: 2006: 2.90%.
Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2008 101 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 25 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued iii Defined benefit schemes major assumptions continued The demographic assumptions which were consistently applied for the main schemes are as follows: Invensys Pension Scheme UK Standard actuarial mortality tables PA92 were adopted using year of birth and medium cohort projections.
Probability of death at each age was multiplied by 126%.
By way of illustration the impact of the application of these mortality tables on the expected longevity of pensioners is shown below: Years Retiring today at age 65: Male 20.2 Female 23.0 Retiring in 20 years at age 65: Male 21.4 Female 24.1 Invensys Pension Plan US The mortality table adopted was the RP 2000 Table for combined employee annuitants, projected to 2008 using projection scale AA.
Sensitivities The Invensys Pension Scheme UK is the largest scheme within the Group, representing 79% of gross liabilities of all defined benefit schemes.
The principal sensitivities are illustrated below: 0.1% 0.1% increase decrease A 0.1% movement in the assumed inflation rate would have the following effect: m m Invensys Pension Scheme UK defined

This is an accrued benefits valuation method that discounts the best estimate of future cash flows and makes allowance for projected earnings.
If the UK Pension Scheme were to be wound up, the relevant employers would be responsible, under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 to fund the UK Pension Scheme up to the levels of the cost of buying out the benefits for all scheme members with an insurer.
This cost would be considerably more than the value placed on the ongoing liabilities for accounting purposes.
The deficit in the UK Pension Scheme calculated on a winding up basis was approximately 1.8 billion as at 30 September 2005, the date of the last actuarial valuation.
This will be reviewed and updated at the next valuation.

In respect of the UK Pension Scheme, Government and Corporate Bond indices have been used to set the expected rate of return on bonds subject to an adjustment for the risk of default, and a risk premium has been applied to determine the expected long-term rate of return on equity investments.
Similar processes are applied to other schemes.
The Trustee of the UK Pension Scheme adopted a new statement of investment principles which resulted in a change in the investment strategy of the scheme in the prior year.
The Trustees target a long-term rate of return on investments as a whole, at 1% per annum over Government stock of appropriate duration to the schemes liabilities.
This investment strategy gives an overall expected rate of return of 5.42% per annum 2007: 5.50% at the balance sheet date based on market conditions at this date.

In addition, the Company will continue to make annual supplemental contributions to the scheme.
These will amount to 28 million in the year ending 31 March 2009, 37 million in the year ending 31 March 2010 and increase by 1 million per annum thereafter until 31 March 2015.
Where the proceeds from the sale of a business exceed 1 million, at least 8% of the proceeds net of tax and costs will be paid as additional contributions to the UK Pension Scheme.
The funding plan is subject to revision after the next triennial valuation which will have a reference date of 31 March 2008.
Under the US plan, the Companys agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation provided for additional contributions of 4% of net proceeds from future disposals.

Interest payable on the Groups major borrowing facilities is settled quarterly throughout the financial year.
Other payables include sales taxes, social security and payroll taxes, payroll creditors, customer advances not related to construction contracts, payments received from customers in advance of work performed on construction contracts and commissions payable.
The majority of non-current other payables will mature in more than one year but in less than two years: there is a small proportion that will mature in over five years.
The maturity profile of trade and other payables classified as financial liabilities is given in Note 22.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of both current and non-current trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.

29 Share-based payment plans The Company operates various share schemes under which options and awards have been granted and are outstanding as detailed below: Plans for senior employees Executive share options Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme Grant details An executive share option scheme under which options have been granted to directors and senior executives at no cost.
Options are exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant date at a price equal to the average middle market quoted price of the Companys shares over the five dealing days which precede the date of grant.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or in the case of awards granted as share appreciation rights, in cash.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: a for grants made prior to 25 July 2001, earnings per share EPS performance of RPI 12% over a three year period to be applied each year until the earlier of when the condition is met or the measurement period the last financial year of which is the year preceding that in which the option will lapse: b for grants made between 25 July 2001 and 16 June 2002 EPS of RPI 12% in the three years after grant or EPS of RPI 16% in the four years after grant or EPS of RPI 20% in the five years after grant, failing which the option will lapse: and c for grants made on 17 June 2002 and after, total shareholder return TSR performance against a peer group of the FTSE100 over a performance period of three, four or five years commencing on the date of grant.
40% will be exercisable if the median position is achieved, rising to 100% if upper quartile position is achieved.
Between these two points the option will vest on a straight-line basis.
If the performance condition is not met in full at the first measurement then it will be retested against the fixed base in years four and five.
If the median position is not achieved by the end of the fifth year the option will lapse.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be exercisable for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use The Company does not propose to operate the Scheme, except in the case of recruitment situations, where it may be considered appropriate.
Hence no options were granted during the years ended 31 March 2008 or 31 March 2007.

Long term incentives Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Grant details A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at no or nominal cost.
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: a a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal payment unless the Company determines otherwise : b a conditional share award: or c a cash award granted in respect of a notional number of shares.
Awards are normally subject to a three year performance period, commencing on the date of award, followed by a retention period.
For awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 the retention period was two years: for awards made on or after 22 July 2005, 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being deferred for one year.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: TSR test TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee with no retesting opportunities.
TSR must rank at the median position when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR in order for 25% of the shares subject to the award to be available subject to the retention period, rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is achieved.
Between these positions, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
If at least the median position is not achieved the whole award will lapse.
The peer groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows: awards granted prior to 22 July 2005: the companies that comprised the FTSE Mid 250 Index on the date of grant: and awards granted on or after 22 July 2005: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger, Schneider, Siemens, Smiths Group and Yokogawa.

Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee after the completion of the first two years of the performance period.
Scheme use Given that no further awards can be granted under the LTIP after July 2008, a new share-based long-term incentive plan, known as the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan has been established and was approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting.
Details of this new scheme are given below.
Grants made during the years ended 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007 are detailed below: LTIP awards LTIP awards granted in the granted in the year ended year ended 31 March 2008 31 March 2007 Total number of awards granted 229,073 6,202,739 Weighted average fair value 121.87p 101.14p Exercise price n a n a Expected volatility n a n a 1 Weighted average expected award life 1.5 years 3.5 years Expected dividend yield 0% 0% Risk free interest rate n a n a Details of relevant LTIP awards outstanding during the year are as follows: Number Number of awards of awards 2008 2007 Outstanding at the beginning of the year 21,584,292 23,220,809 Granted during the year 229,073 6,202,739 Forfeited during the year 3,999,002 4,044,343 Vested during the year 324,959 Lapsed during the year 1,860,751 3,794,913 Outstanding at the end of the year 15,628,653 21,584,292 The LTIP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.1 years 2007: 2.3 years.
1 During the year, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion to depart from the rules of the 1998 LTIP in a specific termination case not related to an executive director.
This award of 143,179 shares has therefore been treated as a forfeiture of the original award, followed by a new grant with a life of three months only, representing the date of agreement to the date of termination.
This has resulted in a shorter weighted average expected award life than is usual.
The remaining grants during the year were therefore 85,894 shares.
2007 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan 2007 LTIP Grant details A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to executive directors and senior executives at no or nominal cost.
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: a a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal payment unless the Company determines otherwise : b a conditional share award: or c a cash award granted in respect of a nominal number of shares.
Awards are normally subject to a three-year performance period, commencing on the date of award.
There is no retention period.
Vesting requirement Performance requirements: awards will be subject to two independent performance conditions.
For executive directors a 50% of an award will be based on growth in the Companys TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index: and b 50% of an award will be based on the compound annual growth rate in the Groups Earnings Per Share.
For all other participants a 35% of an award will be based on growth in the Companys TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index: and b 35% of an award will be based on the compound annual growth rate in the Groups Earnings Per Share.
There are no performance conditions applying to the remaining 30% of an award.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee retains discretion to ensure that, as a condition of vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance of the Group must be satisfactory.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released in defined good leaver cases.
Scheme use The 2007 LTIP is used as the Groups main share-based long term incentive plan under which share awards are granted.
Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2008 113 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 29 Share-based payment plans continued Plans for senior employees continued Grants made during the year ended 31 March 2008, the first year during which 2007 LTIP awards were granted, are detailed below: LTIP awards granted in the year ended 31 March 2008 Total number of awards granted 4,357,047 Weighted average fair value 252.65p Exercise price n a Expected volatility n a Weighted average expected award life 3 years Expected dividend yield 0% Risk free interest rate n a Details of relevant 2007 LTIP awards outstanding during the year are as follows: Number of awards 2008 Outstanding at the beginning of the year Granted during the year 4,357,047 Forfeited during the year 211,324 Vested during the year Lapsed during the year 203,312 Outstanding at the end of the year 3,942,411 The 2007 LTIP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.4 years.
2007 CEO Special Award Special Award Grant details Approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Special Award is a one-off conditional share award granted to the Chief Executive equal to 700% of his 2007 08 base salary.
The Special Award is subject to a three-year performance period.
50% of vested shares will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being released after a 12 month holding period.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: The performance measures applying to the Special Award reflect those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some elements being more demanding.
The Special Award is split into two layers, each of which vests on a different basis.
For the first layer equal to 200% of base salary, 20% will vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance.
For the second layer equal to 500% of base salary, there will be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% will vest for maximum performance.
Vesting in each layer will be on a straight line basis between these points.
For each layer of the Special Award 50% will vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP.
However, for the TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting will require more stretching performance equivalent to upper quintile.
This means outperformance of the mean of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 1.4 i. e. 40%.
Scheme use The Special Award is a one-off grant at no cost.

Vesting requirement Performance requirements: awards are not subject to a specific performance condition apart from continued employment throughout the vesting period.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.

Scheme use The first grant under the TBOP was made on 1 June 2006.
It was originally anticipated that the TBOP would be operated up to and including the financial year 2007 08.
