This note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Directors report where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specific financial risks.
The Group invests in approximately 50 new investment opportunities per annum and each investment is subject to a full risk assessment through an investment approval process.
The Groups Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework.
Capital structure The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, including cash held on deposit, and shareholders equity.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed further in note 20 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in note 27.
Capital is managed so as to maximise the return to shareholders while maintaining a capital base to allow 3i to operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.
Strong realisations from the investment portfolio in recent years have led to the return of capital to shareholders.
This has been achieved through the issue and repurchase of B shares 2008: 808 million: 2007: 700 million, on-market share purchases 2008: 120 million: 2007: 74 million: 2006: 222 million and a special dividend 2006: 245 million.
Group Group 2008 2007 m m Cash, deposits and derivative financial assets 820 2,175 Borrowings and derivative financial liabilities 2,458 2,174 Net debt surplus 1,638 1 Total equity 4,057 4,249 Gearing net debt total equity 40% 0% Capital is managed on a consolidated basis and the gearing KPI is only applicable to the Group, not the Company.
Capital constraints The Group is generally free to transfer capital from subsidiary undertakings to the parent company subject to maintaining each subsidiary with sufficient reserves to meet local statutory obligations.
No significant constraints have been identified in the past and the Group has been able to distribute profits in a tax-efficient manner.
The Company operates so as to qualify as a UK Investment Trust for tax purposes which necessitates its investment in subsidiaries remaining below 15% of the Companys investment portfolio.
The Groups regulated capital requirement is reviewed regularly by the Board of 3i Investments plc, an investment firm that is regulated by the FSA.
The last submission to the FSA demonstrated a significant consolidated capital surplus in excess of the FSAs prudential rules.
Since 1 January 2008 the Groups capital requirement has been amended following approval of the Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP report by the Board of 3i Investments plc.
Although this has increased the regulated capital requirement, there remains a significant regulatory capital surplus.
Financial risks Concentration risk The Groups exposure to and mitigation of concentration risk is explained within investment risks page 41 in the Directors report.
Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across economic sectors and geographies can be found in the additional portfolio and financial information section pages 110 to 115. Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, receivables, cash and deposits.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties with a credit rating of AA or better.
The credit quality of loans and receivables within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
For those assets that are not past due it is believed that the risk of default is small and that capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the Groups investment.
Where the portfolio company has failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a provision for the full amount of the loan.
Partial provisions, or loan impairments, are made when the valuation of the portfolio company implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups loan investment.
In these cases a loan impairment is recorded equal to the valuation shortfall.
Further information on how credit risk is managed is given on page 42 of the Directors report.
In accordance with IFRS7, the amounts shown as past due represent the total credit exposure, not the amount actually past due.

The Groups sensitivity to these items is set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Directors report page 42.
The direct impact of a movement in interest rates is relatively small.
An increase of 100 Basis Points would lead to an approximate exposure of 4 million 2007: 5 million for the Group and 1 million 2007: 5 million for the Company.
This exposure arises principally from changes in interest payable and receivable on floating rate and short-term instruments and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives held at the year end.
In addition the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.. 96 3i Group plc Report and accounts 2008 Portfolio and additional Directors report Directors remuneration report Auditors report Financial statements financial information Information for shareholders 18 Financial risk management continued ii Currency risk Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in the Directors report page 42.
The Groups net assets in Euro, US dollar, Swedish krona, Indian rupee, Swiss franc and all other currencies combined is shown in the table below.
This sensitivity analysis is based on the sensitivity of the Group and Companys monetary assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group hedges currency on a consolidated basis.

Foreign currency interest-bearing loans and borrowings are also used for this purpose.
The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Currency swaps 2,322 1,455 Forward foreign currency contracts 346 174 2,668 1,629 Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Fixed rate to variable rate 10 Variable rate to fixed rate 510 687 Variable rate to variable rate 150 200 660 897 The Group does not trade in derivatives.
In general, derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are included in the income statement.

The margin on this facility increases to 0.235% if the drawn amount is between 33% and 66% of the facility, and to 0.26% if the drawn amount is greater than 66% of the facility.
All of the Groups borrowings are repayable in one instalment on the respective maturity dates.
None of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings are secured on the assets of the Group.
The fair value of the loans and borrowings is 1,840 million 2007: 1,626 million.
