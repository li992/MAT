Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The accounting policies are consistent with the prior year except for the current year adoption of UITF Abstract 44 IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
The Company has granted share-based payments to employees of its subsidiaries and as a result of the adoption of the UITF it has allocated the share-based payment expenses to relevant Group companies.
Comparative amounts have been restated.
The effect of this change in accounting policy has resulted in an increase in the share-based payment expense in the current year of US$65 million 2007: US$53 million decrease, representing amounts allocated to Group companies.
Consequently, Xstrata plc the Company has recorded an expense in relation to share-based payments of US$1 million 2007: restated US$13 million.
The Companys accounting policy in respect of share-based payments is discussed in more detail below.
Xstrata plc the Company has adopted the following principal accounting policies: Investments Equity investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any provision for impairments.
Financial assets Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value on the trade date, plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
This cost is computed as the amount initially recognised minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the initially recognised amount and the maturity amount.
Gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Loans and receivables are derecognised when the Company no longer has a right to receive cash flows from the asset.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate i. e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost that would have been measured if there had been no impairment at the reversal date.
Impairment The carrying values of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether the carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amounts.
Such review is undertaken on income-generating units.
If the carrying value of a fixed asset exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the lower amount.
In assessing the recoverable amounts of fixed assets, the relevant future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of and disposal of the assets have been discounted to their present value using a market-determined discount rate.
Provisions for liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation, as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated will be required to settle the obligation.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future.
In particular: provision is made for tax on gains arising from the disposal of fixed assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only when the replacement assets are sold: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas entities only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that, it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
202 Xstrata plc Annual Report 2008 Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Own shares The cost of purchases of own shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP trust are deducted from equity.
Where they are issued to employees or sold, no gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Any proceeds received on the disposal of the shares or on the transfer of shares to employees are recognised in equity.
Share-based payments The Company makes share-based awards, including free shares and options in the Company, to certain employees and directors of the Group.
The expense recognised in the financial statements relates only to those share-based awards that are granted by the Company, to its employees and directors.
Expenses relating to awards granted to employees and directors of other Group companies are allocated to those companies in accordance with UITF Abstract 44.
Equity-settled awards For equity-settled awards, the fair value is charged to the profit and loss account and credited to retained earnings, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, after adjusting for the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest taking into account the achievement of nonmarket-based performance conditions.
The fair value of the equity-settled awards is determined at the date of the grant by external experts using the models outlined in note 35 of the Group consolidated financial statements.
At each balance sheet date prior to vesting, the cumulative expense representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest is computed after adjusting for non-market performance conditions.
The movement in cumulative expense is recognised in the profit and loss account with a corresponding entry within equity.
Cash-settled awards For cash-settled awards, the fair value is recalculated at each balance date until the awards are settled based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest adjusting for market and non-market-based performance conditions.
During the vesting period, a liability is recognised representing the portion of the vesting period which has expired at the balance sheet date times the fair value of the awards at that date.
After vesting, the full fair value of the unsettled awards at each balance date is recognised as a liability.
Movements in the liability are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The fair value is recalculated using an option pricing model refer to note 35 of the Group consolidated financial statements.
Refer to the accounting policies and note 35 of the Group consolidated financial statements for a full explanation of the valuation of and accounting for the share-based awards.
Loans from subsidiaries Loans from subsidiaries are recognised at inception at the fair value of the proceeds received net of issue costs.
Subsequently, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance costs are recognised in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are booked in the functional currency US$ at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the functional currency at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences are recorded in the profit and loss account.
Foreign currency non-monetary assets and liabilities are not restated at balance sheet date.
Revenue Interest income is recognised as earned on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised as earned when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Income for other services is recognised when the service has been rendered, when the amount of revenue and associated costs can be reliably measured and it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company.
Comparatives Where applicable, comparatives have been adjusted to disclose them on the same basis as current period figures, and have been adjusted for the adoption of UITF Abstract 44 IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
Use of estimates The preparation of these financial statements is in conformity with generally accepted accounting practice and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.
