Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Financial instruments continued b Credit quality of financial assets Trade receivables On a quarterly basis, all trade receivables more than three months overdue are considered for impairment on a line-by-line basis.
Either a provision is made or the lack thereof is justified, with review by senior members of the Groups finance team.

Of those outstanding at 31 December 2008, 9.8 million had been collected by 26 March 2009 and 1.7 million were owed by large, established customers.
Similarly, receivables more than 90 days overdue and not provided for amounted to 3.0 million of which 0.7 million had been collected by 26 March 2009 and 0.4 million was owed by large, established customers.
For the remainder, discussions regarding repayment are ongoing and repayment schedules have been agreed with the customers concerned.
These will be monitored on a quarterly basis per the control outlined above.
No further analysis has been provided here on the quality of these debts as they are not felt to pose a material threat to the Groups future results.
Highly liquid financial assets As at 31 December 2008, 91% 2007: 91% of the Groups cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits and shortterm marketable securities were held with institutions that had either an AA rating or, in the case of UK building societies, had over 1 billion in assets.
Derivative financial assets As at 31 December 2008 and 2007, the Group had no derivative financial assets.

Share repurchase transactions in respect of 55,719,000 shares carried out between 19 May 2006 and 21 February 2007 took place at a time when ARM Holdings plc Company only had no distributable reserves and accordingly such shares were not properly acquired in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, and were not available for re-issue or cancellation.
ARM Holdings plc made an application to the Court during 2007 and cancelled these shares pursuant to a special resolution passed at the 2007 AGM.
At 31 December 2008, a total of 91.2 million shares 2007: 65.2 million were held as Treasury stock and nil shares 2007: 1.2 million shares were held within the ESOP.
At 31 December 2008, own shares held have a nominal value of 0.05 pence 2007: 0.05 pence and in total represent 6.8% 2007: 4.9% of called-up share capital.
22 Acquisitions Logipard AB On 16 December 2008, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Logipard AB Logipard, a video IP company incorporated in Sweden for total consideration of 5.6 million, comprising 5.5 million cash consideration and 0.1 million of related acquisition expenses.
This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition.
Logipard develops power-efficient video encode and decode acceleration technologies for the mobile and consumer markets and enables ARM to bring to market the ARM Mali-five multi standard video engine family of products.
The acquisition adds world class video and imaging technology to the ARM portfolio, making ARM the only IP provider with the in-depth experience and understanding required to meet the market need for an entire range of system elements, from memory controllers, interconnect, application and embedded processors to graphics processors, video engines, physical IP and embedded firmware.
For the reasons given above, combined with the ability to hire the entire workforce of Logipard and synergistic benefits that may arise, the Group paid a premium on the Logipard acquisition, giving rise to goodwill.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2008, the acquisition contributed under 0.1 million to revenue, and incurred a loss of under 0.1 million before interest and tax.
Had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2008, it would not have made a material difference to the Groups results.
The acquisition did not make a material contribution to the Groups post-acquisition net operating cash flows, tax paid or capital expenditure.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
At 31 December 2008, the accounting for the Logipard acquisition was determined on a provisional basis because the fair values assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities were only provisional.
Any adjustments to these provisional values as a result of completing work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired will be recognised within 12 months of the acquisition date and will be recognised as if they had occurred as at the date of acquisition.

The fair value assigned to in-process research and development was estimated using the discounted cash flow method with a post-tax discount rate of approximately 61%.
Developed technology Developed technology of 3.2 million comprises internally-developed technologies.
At the date of acquisition, developed technologies were complete and had reached technological feasibility.
Any costs incurred in the future will relate to ongoing maintenance of the technologies and will be expensed as incurred.
To estimate the fair value of the internally-developed technologies, a discounted cash flow method, specifically the income approach, was used with a post-tax discount rate of 45%.
Developed technologies are being amortised over an estimated useful life of five years.
Customer relationships The customer base of 1.7 million represented the fair value of existing customer contracts.
To estimate their fair value, a discounted cash flow method, specifically the income approach, was used with reference to the terms of the contracts and managements estimates of the revenue which will be generated from the customer relationships.
The valuation was considered in conjunction with an asset purchase made by the Group of similar contracts with the same customers at the same time as the acquisition.
A post-tax discount rate of 40% was used for the valuation.
Customer relationships are being amortised over an estimated useful life of five years.
82 ARM Holdings plc 23 Share-based payments The Group has several share option schemes in current operation, whereby options over shares in the Company can be granted to employees and directors.
The different schemes are described below, but all options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant, except for those options within the SAYE and ESPP schemes as detailed below.
Furthermore, from 2006, the Company has issued Restricted Stock Units RSUs to employees instead of options which are actual share awards on vesting rather than options to buy shares at a fixed exercise price.
Whilst the Company reserves the right to award options to employees going forward, the majority of awards to employees will be in RSUs.
Under the UK Inland Revenue Executive Approved Share Option Plan the Executive Scheme, the Company may grant options to employees meeting certain eligibility requirements.
Options under the Executive Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
Under the Companys Unapproved Scheme the Unapproved Scheme, for which it has not sought approval from the UK tax authorities, options are exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
The Company also operates the US ISO Scheme, which is substantially the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue.
Under both of these schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary, 100% maximum on fourth anniversary.
Various options to directors under the Unapproved Scheme have certain performance criteria attached, which if met are exercisable after three years, otherwise they will become exercisable after seven years.
There are further schemes for our French and Belgian employees the French Scheme and the Belgian Scheme.
In the French Scheme, options are exercisable between four and seven years after their issue, whilst in the Belgian Scheme, options are exercisable from 1 January following the third anniversary after their issue, up to seven years from issue.
Upon the acquisition of Artisan in 2004, the Company assumed the share schemes of Artisan existing at acquisition.
The schemes remained substantially the same as prior to the acquisition, other than the options became options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc instead of Artisan Components Inc.
The number and value of options were amended in line with the conversion ratio as detailed in the merger agreement.
The schemes assumed were the 1993 Plan, the 1997 Plan, the 2000 Plan, the 2003 Plan, the Director Plan, the Executive Plan and the ND00 Plan.
Under each plan, there are multiple vesting templates and vesting periods.
The majority of the options were already vested upon acquisition, and the most common template was 25% vesting after one year, and then 6.25% vesting each quarter thereafter, until 100% vest after four years.
Some options vest on a monthly basis, and some vest over five years.
All options lapse ten years from the date of grant.
The Company also offers savings-related share option schemes SAYE for all non-US employees and executive directors of the Group.
The number of options granted is related to the value of savings made by the employee.
The period of savings is three or five years.
The option price for grants made in 2008 and 2007 was set at 80% of the market share price prior to the announcement of the grant, but in previous years was set at 85%, and the right to exercise normally only arises for a six-month period once the savings have been completed.
In 2007, the Company commenced a new savingsrelated option scheme for US employees, namely the Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP.
The period of savings is six months, with the option price being at 85% of the lower of the market share price at the beginning and end of the scheme.
The main RSU awards to employees in all jurisdictions other than France vest similarly to the unapproved scheme above, namely 25% on each anniversary over four years.
RSU awards to our French employees vest 50% after two years, and then a further 25% after three and four years.
Additionally, the Company operates a Deferred Annual Bonus plan DAB.
Under the DAB, which is for directors and selected senior management within the Group, participants are required to defer 50% of any related annual bonus into shares on a compulsory basis.
These shares will be deferred for three years, and then a further matching award will be made depending on the achievement of an EPS performance condition over that time.
The Company also operates the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, also for directors and selected senior management, whereby share awards are made and vest depending on the Companys TSR performance compared to two comparator groups over the three-year performance period.
ARM Holdings plc 83 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Share-based payments continued As disclosed in note 5, staff expenses arising from these share-based compensation schemes of 15.4 million 2007: 16.8 million were charged to the income statement in the year.
This is in line with the Groups policies for recognition and measurement of the costs associated with these remuneration schemes as outlined in note 1.
The fair value of options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, except for the ESPP whose fair value is the intrinsic value of the award at the date of vest.
The following assumptions for each option grant during 2007 and 2008 were as follows: Grant date 16 Feb 2008 27 Jun 2008 16 Aug 2008 22 Jun 2007 Scheme ESPPSAYEESPP SAYE Share price at grant date 0.9825 0.8607 1.1025 1.38 Exercise price 0.8351 0.81 0.8351 1.104 Number of employees 305 325 297 208 Shares under option 1,034,055 2,871,580 1,007,592 1,065,813 Vesting period years 35 35 Expected volatility 37%-38% 32%43% Expected life years 35 35 Risk free rate 5.0% 5.5% Dividend yield 2.32% 1.45% Fair value per option 0.1474 0.2430.302 0.2674 0.480.65 The fair value of RSUs, LTIP and DAB awards granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
As all are share awards with no exercise price, all awards have been deemed to have an exercise price of 0.0000001 in the Black-Scholes model.
The expected life is the expected period to exercise.
A reconciliation of option and share award movements over the year to 31 December 2008 is shown below.
Share awards do not have an exercise price and therefore the reconciliation below shows only the number of awards, with no corresponding weighted average exercise prices.
Consistent with such practice, the Group provides such indemnification to its licensees but subject, in all cases, to a limitation of liability.
The obligation for the Group to indemnify its licensees is subject to certain provisos and is usually contingent upon a third party bringing an action against the licensee alleging that the technology licensed by the Group to the licensee infringes such third partys intellectual property rights.
The indemnification obligations typically survive any termination of the licence and will continue in perpetuity.
The Group does not provide for any such guarantees unless it has received notification from the other party that they are likely to invoke the guarantee.
The provision is made if both of the following conditions are met: i information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements: and ii the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Any such provision is based upon the directors estimate of the expected costs of any such claim.

A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been consistently applied and reviewed by the board of directors in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18, Accounting policies, is set out below: Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, as modified for fair value in relation to share-based payments.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are initially recorded at cost.
Where an acquisition satisfies the provisions of sections 131 to 134 of the Companies Act 1985 for merger relief, the investment is stated at the nominal value of shares issued plus the fair value of any other consideration.
Cash flow statement The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 1 Revised 1996 Cash flow statements which provides that where a company is a member of a group and a consolidated cash flow statement is published, the company does not have to prepare a cash flow statement.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences have been included in operating profit.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments The Company does not have any financial instruments, other than intercompany payables and receivables and cash.
Due to the short-term nature of these balances, the Company considers the fair value of these items to equal the carrying value.
Because the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements of the ARM Holdings plc group which are publicly available, and the financial disclosures required by FRS 29 are in those financial statements, no disclosure has been presented in these financial statements.
Share schemes The Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP is a separately administered trust which is funded by loans from the group, and the assets of which comprise shares in the Company.
In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, the Company recognises the assets and liabilities of the ESOP in its own accounts and shares held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees.
All shares within the ESOP have now been awarded and the ESOP is in the process of being wound-up.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments, including an LTIP, to certain employees of subsidiary undertakings.
In accordance with FRS 20, equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed in the accounts of the subsidiary companies on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The Company operates Save As You Earn SAYE schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP in the US.
Options under the SAYE scheme granted in 2007 and 2008 were at a 20% discount to market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant, whereas for all prior years was at a 15% discount.
The UK SAYE schemes are approved by the Inland Revenue, which stipulates that the saving period must be at least 36 months.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available, and has applied the provisions of FRS 20 only to those options granted after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 31 December 2004.
The Company does not have any employees and as such, in accordance with UITF 44, all share-based compensation has been recorded as capital contributions to subsidiaries.
Treasury shares The Company has a share buyback programme under which the Company purchases its own shares and holds them as treasury shares.
These shares will be used to satisfy employee share option exercises and other share awards.
In accordance with UITF 38, the Company recognises these shares at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds.
2 Profit for the financial year As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the parent companys profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
The parent companys loss after taxation, including dividends receivable and before dividends payable was 1,424,000 2007: profit of 148,324,000.
The Company has no employees: all six directors have contracts of service with ARM Limited, a subsidiary of the Company.
All emoluments of these directors are paid by ARM Limited and are disclosed in the remuneration report within these financial statements.

The option price for grants made in 2007 and 2008 was set at 80% of the market share price prior to the grant, but in previous years was set at 85%, and the right to exercise normally only arises for a six-month period once the savings have been completed.
In 2007, the Company commenced a new savings-related option scheme for employees of ARM Inc. namely the Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP.
The Company also issues restricted stock units RSUs to employees which are actual share awards on vesting rather than options to buy shares at a fixed exercise price.
