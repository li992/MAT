In the year ended 31 December 2008, Reynolds American modified the previously anticipated level of support between certain trademarks and the projected net sales of certain trademarks, resulting in a trademark impairment charge of which the Groups share amounted to 20 million net of tax 2007: 7 million.
The year end of ST, an associate of the Group until 2 July 2008, was 30 June, and, for practical reasons, the Group had previously equity accounted for its interest based on the information available from ST which was 3 months in arrears to that of the Group.
As explained in note 26 a, the Group acquired 100 per cent of STs cigarette and snus businesses on 2 July 2008. ln order to account for the Groups share of the net assets of ST at the date of the acquisition, the results of ST for the period up to 2 July 2008 have been included in the results from associates for 2008, resulting in 1 additional quarters income in 2008.
This contributed an additional 13 million to the share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures.
On 21 February 2008, Reynolds American announced that it would receive a payment from Gallaher Limited resulting from the termination of a joint venture agreement.
While the payment will be received over a number of years, in the year ended 31 December 2008, Reynolds American recognised a pre-tax gain of US$328 million.
The Groups share of this gain included in the results for the year amounts to 45 million net of tax.
