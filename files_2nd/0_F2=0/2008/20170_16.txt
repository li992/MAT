Subsidiaries in the Group have provided for taxation at the appropriate rates in the countries in which they operate.
As the Groups investment returns are primarily non-Jersey source and included in the Company, the total tax provided for the Group is minimal.

This note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to Risks and uncertainties where applicable, and providing further quantitative data on specific financial risks.
Each investment made by the Group is subject to a full risk assessment through a standardised investment approval process.
The Boards investment committee and Investment Advisers investment process is part of the overall risk management framework.
The funding objective of the Group and Company is that each category of investment is broadly matched with liabilities and shareholders funds according to the risk and maturity characteristics of the assets and that funding needs are met ahead of planned investment.
Capital structure The Group has a continuing commitment to capital efficiency.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash held on deposit and shareholders equity.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed in note 11 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to maximise the return to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital base that ensures 3i Infrastructure can operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.
Capital is allocated for investment in Utilities, Transportation and Social Infrastructure across the UK, Continental Europe, Asia and the US.
As set out in the Groups investment policy, the maximum exposure to any one investment is 20% of gross assets including cash holdings.
44 3i Infrastructure Limited Annual report and accounts 2008 Notes to the accounts continued 9 Financial risk management continued Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, receivables, cash and deposits.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties with a credit rating AA or better.
The credit quality of loans and receivables within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
For those assets that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the investment.
If the portfolio company failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a fair value adjustment for the full amount of the loan.
Fair value adjustments, or loan impairments, are made when the valuation of the portfolio company implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups loan investment.
In these cases a loan impairment is recorded equal to the valuation shortfall.
At 31 March 2008, there were no loans and receivables considered past due.
Liquidity risk Further information on how liquidity risk is managed is provided in the Risks and uncertainties report on page 21.
The table below analyses the maturity of the Groups contractual liabilities.

Market risk The valuation of the Groups portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio but the valuation and other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market fluctuations.
The Groups sensitivities to these are set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in Risks and uncertainties on page 20.
The direct impact of a movement in interest rates is relatively small.
An increase of 100 basis points over 12 months would lead to an approximate exposure of 2.6 million for the Group.
This exposure relates principally to changes in interest payable and receivable on floating rate and short-term instruments and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives held at year end.
In addition, the Group has indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.
The Company does not hold variable rate loans as assets or liabilities and is therefore not directly exposed to interest rate risk.
3i Infrastructure Limited Annual report and accounts 2008 45 9 Financial risk management continued ii Currency risk Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in Risks and uncertainties on page 20.
The currency denomination of the Groups assets in euros and US dollars are shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis is demonstrating the sensitivity of the Group and Companys net assets to movement in foreign currency exchange rates.

Forward foreign exchange contracts The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to minimise the effect of fluctuations in the value of the proportion of the income from the investment portfolio from movement in exchange rates.
The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
At the balance sheet date the notional amount of forward foreign exchange contracts was 40.8 million.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its interest-bearing borrowings.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken through the income statement.
At the balance sheet date the notional amount of interest rate swaps was 151.0 million, for variable to fixed rate swaps.

Transactions between 3i Infrastructure and 3i Group 3i Group plc 3i Group holds 46.2% of the ordinary shares of the Company and also holds warrants which gives it rights to acquire a further 32.5 million ordinary shares.
This classifies 3i Group as a substantial shareholder of the Company as defined by the Listing Rules.
As stated in the Prospectus detailing the IPO the Prospectus, issued on 20 February 2007, the Group acquired a portfolio of four infrastructure investments from 3i Group on 13 March 2007 for 234.4 million.

As set out in the Prospectus, this investment was made by 3i Group shortly before the flotation of 3i Infrastructure.
It was not practicable to include it in the initial portfolio of assets acquired from 3i Group at flotation but was made available for acquisition by 3i Infrastructure after the IPO.

It also acts as the manager for the 3i India Infrastructure Fund.
3i plc, another subsidiary of 3i Group, together with 3i Investments, provides support services to the Company.
Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, an annual advisory fee is payable to 3i plc based on the Gross Investment Value of 3i Infrastructure at the end of each financial period.
Gross Investment Value can be defined as the total aggregate value including any subscription obligations of the investments of the Company as at the start of a financial period plus any investment excluding cash made during the period valued at cost including any subscription obligations.
The applicable annual rate is 1.5%, dropping to an annual rate of 1.25% for investments that have been held by the Group for longer than five years.
The advisory fee accrues throughout a financial period and quarterly instalments are payable on account of the advisory fee for that period.
The advisory fee is not payable in respect of cash or cash equivalent liquid temporary investments held by the Group throughout a financial period.
In the period from 16 January 2007 to 31 March 2008, 7.0 million was paid and 1.0 million remains due to 3i plc.
