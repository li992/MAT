b Richards Bay Minerals comprises two legal entities, Tisand Pty Limited and Richards Bay Iron and Titanium Pty Limited of which the Groups ownership interest is 51 per cent 2007: 51 per cent and 49.4 per cent 2007: 49.4 per cent respectively.
In accordance with the shareholder agreement between the venturers, Richards Bay Minerals functions as a single economic entity.
The overall profit of Richards Bay Minerals is shared equally between the venturers.
c While the Group legally holds a 57.5 per cent interest in Minera Escondida Limitada, the entity is subject to effective joint control due to participant and management agreements which results in the operation of an Owners Council, whereby significant commercial and operational decisions are determined on aggregate voting interests of at least 75 per cent of the total ownership interest.
Accordingly the Group does not have the ability to unilaterally control, and therefore consolidate, the investment in accordance with IAS 27 AASB 127 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
