Notes to the accounts year ended 31 March 2008 1.
General information Homeserve plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on page 32.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IAS 23 Borrowing Costs March 2007 IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease IFRIC 5 Right to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim reporting and impairments IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
64 Homeserve Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Investments in joint ventures The Groups share of results of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of their net assets is included in the consolidated balance sheet, including associated goodwill.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
During the year, the contingent consideration payable on the 2006 acquisition of Digital Insurance Services Limited was reduced by 2,683,000.
Goodwill on the acquisition has been reduced accordingly, with the goodwill and contingent consideration being restated in the comparitive period.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Membership businesses Revenue in respect of the UK and overseas Membership businesses include amounts receivable from the sale of policies, stated net of commissions payable and Insurance Premium Tax.
Revenue is recognised on the sale of a policy except where an obligation exists to provide future services where an appropriate proportion of monies received in advance are treated as deferred income and recognised over the relevant period.
Revenue from contracts of reinsurance is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the policies.
All associated costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.
If claims costs under reinsurance contracts are expected to exceed revenue, the shortfall would be charged to the income statement immediately.
Emergency Services businesses Revenue in the UK and overseas Emergency Services businesses represents amounts receivable, excluding VAT, from the sale of goods and services and is recognised on completion of the obligations relating to the work.
Homeserve Annual Report & Accounts 2008 65 Notes to the Accounts year ended 31 March 2008 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging all operating costs and after the share of results of joint ventures but before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
66 Homeserve Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Buildings 2550 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 7 years Computer equipment 37 years Motor vehicles 3 years with 25% residual value Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Intangible assets Intangible assets that are acquired on acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking or business are stated at their fair value and are amortised over their useful lives as follows: Customer relationships databases 37 years Franchise assets 315 years Computer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised over their useful lives of 37 years.
Homeserve Annual Report & Accounts 2008 67 Notes to the accounts year ended 31 March 2008 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
68 Homeserve Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Hedge accounting The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is included within finance costs.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provision, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled, share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on the type of scheme.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase the Groups ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through Save As You Earn schemes.
The Group records an expense, based on its estimate of the discount related to shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Homeserve Annual Report & Accounts 2008 69 Notes to the accounts year ended 31 March 2008 3.
Judgements and estimation uncertainty Revenue recognition Within the Policy Membership businesses, an appropriate proportion of revenue is deferred to future periods when the Group has obligations extending to future periods.
As a result, judgement is required in assessing the extent and associated costs of fulfilling those future obligations.
The Group uses historical experience and forecast activity levels in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognise in the current period and how much to defer to future periods.
Impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets The annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates of the value in use of cash-generating units to which goodwill and acquisition intangibles have been allocated to be calculated.
As a result, estimates of future cash flows are required, together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying value of goodwill is 221m 2007 restated: 189m.
The carrying value of acquisition intangibles is 47.6m 2007: 35.1m.
Pensions The Group participates in a defined benefit pension scheme for certain employees.
The scheme assets and liabilities are valued by an independent qualified actuary using the assumptions summarised in note 37.
As required by IAS19, the value of the defined benefit obligation has been measured using the projected unit credit method which requires the use of judgement and estimation.
Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Provision of services 554,875 477,362 Investment income see note 9 1,102 1,030 555,977 478,392 5. Business and geographical segments Segment revenues and results For the year ended 31 March 2008, the Group has adopted IFRS 8 Segmental Reporting.
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
In contrast, the predecessor Standard IAS 14 Segment Reporting required the Group to identify two sets of segments business and geographical, using a risks and rewards approach, with the Groups system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel serving only as the starting point for the identification of such segments.
Following the integration of the utility branded and warranties businesses in the UK, and the progress during the year in Continental Europe and the USA, the Group is managed around four operating divisions UK Membership, UK Emergency Services, Continental Europe and the United States of America.
As a result, the disclosure requirements of IFRS8 are more consistent with the way in which the Group is managed and reviewed by the Chief Executive.

In March 2007 the UK government announced that they would introduce legislation that would reduce the corporation tax rate to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
This legislation was substantially enacted in July 2007.
As a result of this change, deferred tax assets and liabilities have been restated in the year to 28% of all temporary differences.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the directors and extrapolates cash flows based on an estimated growth rate of 2.5% 2007: 2.5%.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 11.3% 2007: 11.3%.

This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers.
5.9million 2007: 4.4million is due from Royal Bank of Scotland, the Groups largest customer.
There are no other customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 32.4million 2007: 21.2million which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of receivables not impaired is 37 days 2007: 28 days.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables: 2008 2007 000 000 1-30 days 13,910 8,460 30-60 days 5,524 4,194 60-90 days 3,858 2,047 90 days 9,118 6,548 Balance at 31 March past due but not impaired 32,410 21,249 Current 84,164 71,748 Balance at 31 March 116,574 92,997 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts: 2008 2007 000 000 At 1 April 3,024 1,678 Acquisitions 713 535 Impairment losses recognised 1,112 1,551 Amounts written off as uncollectible 924 723 Amounts recovered during the year 464 17 Balance at 31 March 3,461 3,024 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Ageing of impaired trade receivables: 2008 2007 000 000 1-30 days 402 101 30-60 days 83 95 60-90 days 232 160 90 days 2,744 2,668 3,461 3,024 The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

The vesting period is three years and is dependent upon the real increase in Earnings Per Share over the vesting period.
In addition, since 2006, vesting has also been dependant upon a share price target.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
ii 2005 Key Executive Incentive Plan 'KEIP' The KEIP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Companys shares on the day before the date of grant.
The awards vest in two tranches, the first being between three and four years from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche.
The number of awards vesting is dependent upon the Profit Before Tax of the Group for the year ending 31 March 2008 and is subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 March 2009.

The results of the actuarial valuation as at 1 April 2005 were updated to the accounting date by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS 19.
As required by IAS 19, the value of the defined benefit obligation, the past service cost and the current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.

Insurance Contracts During the year the Group, through its subsidiary Affinity Partners Limited, entered into contracts of reinsurance with an independent insurance company that underwrites the policies marketed and administered by Homeserve Membership Limited formerly Homeserve GB Limited.
Under these arrangements, Affinity Partners Limited underwrites 49% of the risk and reward associated with these policies 'the policies'.
The policies are entered into between the customers of Homeserve Membership Limited and an independent insurance company in the United Kingdom only.
The policies are principally in relation to underwritten cover for a broad range of domestic emergencies relating to Plumbing and Drains, Electrical Wiring, Water and Gas Supply Pipes and Gas Boilers.
Revenue from the reinsurance contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the policies typically 12 months, reflecting the period of benefit to the customer.
Where the reinsurance premium is received in advance, an appropriate amount is included within deferred income.
The costs associated with the claims received under the contract of reinsurance are recognised as they are incurred.
An assessment is made of whether the expected cash inflows under the reinsurance contracts are sufficient to meet the expected future claims costs under the reinsurance contracts.
If a shortfall were to arise, this would be charged immediately to the income statement.
Affinity Partners ceased to underwrite new policies from 1 October 2007.
The amounts recognised by the Group in respect of reinsurance contracts are as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Revenue 39,421 43,054 Claims costs 34,509 42,666 Deferred income 3,036 11,212 The principal impact on the amount of claims incurred under the reinsurance contracts relate to weather conditions, which can impact the frequency of claims and the nature of the emergency.
In order to assist in managing the risk arising from the policies, the claims costs are fixed for each type of emergency repair.
There is no concentration of insurance risk due to the immaterial size of each of the policies.
Neither the policies or the reinsurance contract are exposed to any significant liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, nor are there any exposures relating to embedded derivatives.
As the policies relate to emergency repairs and generally cover a 12 month period, all cash outflows are expected to occur within 12 months from the date of commencement of the policies.
On a weighted average basis, across all policies, a 1 percentage point increase in claims frequencies would result in additional claims costs of 0.1m 2007: 1.0m.

Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group are able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 21, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 25 to 32.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital: 2008 2007 000 000 Shareholders funds 265,413 230,448 Bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities 90,000 41,539 Unsecured loan notes 304 487 Certain of the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements from the Financial Services Authority.
Where such requirements exist, the Group manages the risk through the close monitoring of perfomance and distributable capital within the entities impacted by the regulations.
The Group has complied with all such arrangements throughout the current and preceding year.
Financial risk management objectives The Groups principal financial instruments, comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes and cash and cash equivalents.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, derivatives and loans to joint ventures which arise directly from its operations.
Classification of financial instruments In addition to the other financial assets and liabilities disclosed in notes 20, 21 and 23, the Group has derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships with a notional value of 50.0m 2007: nil and a carrying value and fair value of nil 2007: nil.
The fair value of these derivative instruments has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates, sourced from observable market data.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
96 Homeserve Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long term debt requirements with floating interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
To manage this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
The maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities is provided in the table opposite.
Interest is payable on the banks overdraft and revolving credit facilities and loan notes.
Deferred and contingent consideration payments are stated on the basis of expected cash outflows, before discounting.

It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
At 31 March 2008 the Group had in place an interest rate swap to hedge loans subject to varible interest rates linked to LIBOR whereby it receives a floating rate of interest based on 1 month LIBOR on a notional principal of 50m and pays a fixed rate of interest of 4.9%.
No such instrument was held at 31 March 2007.
The remaining term of the interest rate swap is between 1 and 2 years.
The fair value of the interest rate swap at 31 March 2008 was nil 2007: nil.
The timing of the impact on the income statement of the swap is between 1 and 2 years of the balance sheet date.
The impact of the cash flow hedge on the income statement will be expensed through the finance cost line.

It is the Groups policy that, with the exception of our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
The majority of the Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence for these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty.
In addition, receivable balances within our Emergency Services business are monitored on an ongoing basis.
As a result, the Groups exposure to bad debts is not considered to be significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and investment in joint ventures, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with reputable and credit worthy banking institutions.
The risk associated with the investment in joint ventures is mitigated through the close management and regular review of the performance of the assets.
The Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
98 Homeserve Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Group's Board which sets the framework for the management of the Group's short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Included in note 21 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Group to further reduce liquidity risk.
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, all of the Groups financial liabilities are due for payment within 1 year, based on contractual payment terms.
