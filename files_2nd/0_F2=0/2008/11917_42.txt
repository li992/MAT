Prior to 1 January 1998 all goodwill was written off to reserves on the date of acquisition.
3,309m of the carrying value relates to acquisitions completed between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 and 1,261m relates to acquisitions completed after 1 January 2003 the date of transition to IFRS.
For acquisitions completed between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 no value was ascribed to intangibles other than goodwill and the goodwill on each acquisition was amortised over a period of up to 20 years.
On adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2003, the Group chose not to restate the goodwill balance and at that date the balance was frozen i. e. amortisation ceased.
If goodwill had been restated then a significant value would have been ascribed to other intangible assets, which would be subject to amortisation, and the carrying value of goodwill would be significantly lower.
For acquisitions completed after 1 January 2003 value has been ascribed to other intangible assets, which are amortised, with only the remaining difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired being allocated to goodwill.
Other intangible assets Other intangibles acquired include content, technology and software rights.
Amortisation of 5m 2007: 3m is included in the income statement in cost of goods sold and 111m 2007: 67m in administrative and other expenses.
Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill Impairment tests have been carried out where appropriate as described below.
The recoverable amount for each unit tested exceeds its carrying value.
Goodwill is allocated to 14 cash-generating units CGUs within the business segments as follows: All figures in millions Notes 2008 2007 US School Curriculum 937 677 US School Assessment and Information 722 414 US Higher Education 1,164 839 Canada 173 155 International Education Publishing 315 270 International Education Assessment and Testing 241 194 Professional Publishing 15 10 Professional Assessment and Testing 254 181 Pearson Education total 3,821 2,740 Financial Times 46 12 Mergermarket 130 126 Interactive Data 208 147 FT Group total 384 285 Penguin US 216 155 Penguin UK 95 111 Pearson Australia 54 52 Penguin total 365 318 Total goodwill continuing operations 4,570 3,343 Goodwill held for sale 96 31 Total goodwill 4,570 3,439 During 2008, after the change in organisational structure the CGUs were reorganised and goodwill reallocated to the units affected.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
Other than goodwill there are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.
The goodwill is generally denominated in the currency of the relevant cash flows and therefore the impairment review is not materially sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations.
Key assumptions The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
The key assumptions used by management in the value in use calculations were: Discount rate The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate for government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk in investing in equities.
The risk premium adjustment is assessed for each specific CGU.
The average pre-tax discount rates used are in the range of 10.2% to 11.7% for the Pearson Education businesses 2007: 10.5% to 12.0%, 10.8% to 20.5% for the FT Group businesses 2007: 10.4% to 17.2% and 8.8% to 10.4% for the Penguin businesses 2007: 8.9% to 11.7%.
Perpetuity growth rates The cash flows subsequent to the approved budget period are based upon the long-term historic growth rates of the underlying territories in which the CGU operates and reflect the long-term growth prospects of the sectors in which the CGU operates.
A perpetuity growth rate of 2.0% was used for all CGUs in 2008 a range from 2.5% to 3.5% in 2007.
The perpetuity growth rates are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
