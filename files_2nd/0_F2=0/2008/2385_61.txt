BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes on financial statements 6.
Segmental analysis The groups primary format for segment reporting is business segments and the secondary format is geographical segments.
The risks and returns of the groups operations are primarily determined by the nature of the different activities that the group engages in, rather than the geographical location of these operations.
This is reflected by the groups organizational structure and internal financial reporting systems.
In 2008, BP had two reportable operating segments: Exploration and Production and Refining and Marketing.
Exploration and Productions activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production upstream activities, together with related pipeline, transportation and processing activities midstream activities, as well as the marketing and trading of natural gas including LNG, power and natural gas liquids NGLs.
The activities of Refining and Marketing include the supply and trading, refining, manufacturing, marketing and transportation of crude oil, petroleum and chemicals products and related services.
The group is managed on an integrated basis.
Other businesses and corporate comprises the Alternative Energy business, Shipping, the groups aluminium asset, Treasury which in the segmental analysis includes all of the groups cash, cash equivalents and associated interest income, and corporate activities worldwide.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the groups accounting policies described in Note 1.
Sales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved.
Segment revenues and segment results include transactions between business segments.
These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless unrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The groups geographical segments are based on the location of the groups assets.
The UK and the US are significant countries of activity for the group: the other geographical segments are groupings of countries determined by geographical location.
Sales to external customers are based on the location of the seller, which in most circumstances is not materially different from the location of the customer.
Crude oil and LNG are commodities for which there is an international market and buyers and sellers can be widely separated geographically.
The UK segment includes the UK-based international activities of Refining and Marketing.
