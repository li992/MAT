NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 1 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and interpretations adopted by the European Union.
During 2008, the following accounting standards and guidance were adopted by the Group: IFRS 8 Operating segments: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, but adopted early IFRIC 11: IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions IFRIC 14: IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction These pronouncements either had no impact on the financial statements or resulted in changes to presentation and disclosure only.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and guidance relevant to the Group were in issue but not yet effective.
In some cases these standards and guidance had not been endorsed by the European Union: Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: - Reclassification of Financial Instruments: andReclassification of Financial Instruments: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008 IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 October 2008 IAS 23 Revised Borrowing Costs: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements A revised presentation: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based payment: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009 Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Eligible Hedged Items: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009 IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009 IFRS 3 revised Business combinations: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 These pronouncements, when applied, will either result in changes to presentation and disclosure, or are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
The majority of amendments made as part of the IASBs Annual Improvements programme affect accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
Included within the amendments is a change in the accounting treatment for development properties.
Currently, such properties are accounted for under IAS 16, but they will in future be accounted for under IAS 40.
This change will mean that revaluation surpluses and deficits on development properties will in future be recognised in the income statement rather than equity.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 59 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 1 CONTINUED BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Directors Report on page 42.
The financial statements are presented in sterling.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that investment and development properties, owner-occupied properties, investments and derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of entities included in the consolidated financial statements.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period.
If the revision affects both current and future periods, the change is recognised over those periods.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
However, the nature of Hammersons business means that there is a limited requirement for management to make such judgements or estimates which would have a significant impact on the financial statements.
For example, the single most significant line item in the financial statements, Investment and development properties, is supported by external valuations.
The principal risks and uncertainties related to the Group, including those related to property valuations, are discussed on page 15.
Adjustments are made to basic earnings and earnings per share for items which management judges are exceptional by virtue of their size or nature.
The Company has elected for UK REIT and French SIIC status.
In order to continue to benefit from these favourable tax regimes, the Group is required to comply with certain conditions as outlined in notes 8F and 8G to the accounts.
Management intends that the Group should continue as a UK REIT and French SIIC for the foreseeable future.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION SUBSIDIARIES Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control is assumed when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity, or business, to benefit from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where properties are acquired through corporate acquisitions and there are no significant assets or liabilities other than property, the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition, in other cases the acquisition method is used.
JOINT VENTURES Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups proportionate share of assets, liabilities, results and cash flows of joint ventures.
GOODWILL Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Where the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is greater than the cost, the excess, known as negative goodwill, is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 60 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 1 CONTINUED FOREIGN CURRENCY FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at exchange rates approximating to the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date and, unless they relate to the hedging of the net investment in foreign operations, differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The operating income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period.
Significant transactions, such as property sales, are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of each transaction.
The principal exchange rate used to translate foreign currency denominated amounts in the balance sheet is the rate at the end of the year, 1 1.034 2007: 1 1.362.
The principal exchange rate used for the income statement is the average rate, 1 1.258 2007: 1 1.461.
NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, including the effective portions of related foreign currency hedges, are taken to the translation reserve.
They are released to the income statement upon disposal of the foreign operation.
BORROWINGS, INTEREST AND DERIVATIVES BORROWINGS Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, after taking account of any discount on issue and attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently, borrowings are held at amortised cost, such that discounts and costs are charged to the income statement over the term of the borrowing at a constant return on the carrying amount of the liability.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency movements and interest rate risks.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value, which equates to cost and subsequently remeasured at fair value, with changes in fair value being included in the income statement, except that a gain or loss on the portion of an instrument that is an effective hedge for the net investment in a foreign operation is recognised in the hedging reserve.
TRADE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES Trade receivables and payables are initially measured at fair value, subsequently measured at amortised cost and, where material, discounted to reflect the time value of money.
NET FINANCE COSTS Net finance costs include interest payable on borrowings, net of interest capitalised, interest receivable on funds invested, and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
CAPITALISATION OF INTEREST Interest is capitalised if it is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of development properties or the redevelopment of investment properties.
Capitalisation commences when the activities to develop the property start and continues until the property is substantially ready for its intended use.
Capitalised interest is calculated with reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, for that part of the development cost financed out of general funds, to the average rate.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 61 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 1 CONTINUED PROPERTY PORTFOLIO TENANT LEASES Management has exercised judgement in considering the potential transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 Leases for all properties leased to tenants and has determined that such leases are operating leases.
DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES Properties acquired with the intention of redevelopment are classified as development properties and stated at fair value.
Changes in fair value above cost are recognised in equity, and changes in fair value below cost are recognised in the income statement.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a development property are capitalised.
When development properties are completed, they are reclassified as investment properties and any accumulated revaluation surplus or deficit is transferred to retained earnings.
INVESTMENT PROPERTIES Investment properties are stated at fair value, being market value determined by professionally qualified external valuers, and changes in fair value are included in the income statement.
DEPRECIATION In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property and IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment, development and owner-occupied properties.
LEASEHOLD PROPERTIES Leasehold properties that are leased out to tenants under operating leases are classified as investment properties or development properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The obligation to the freeholder or superior leaseholder for the buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception.
Payments to the freeholder or superior leaseholder are apportioned between a finance charge and a reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Contingent rents payable, such as rent reviews or those related to rental income, are charged as an expense in the periods in which they are incurred.
NET RENTAL INCOME Rental income from investment property leased out under an operating lease is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Contingent rents, such as turnover rents, rent reviews and indexation, are recorded as income in the periods in which they are earned.
Rent reviews are recognised when such reviews have been agreed with tenants.
Lease incentives and costs associated with entering into tenant leases are amortised over the period to the first break option or, if the probability that the break option will be exercised is considered low, over the lease term.
Property operating expenses are expensed as incurred and any property operating expenditure not recovered from tenants through service charges is charged to the income statement.
PROFITS ON SALE OF PROPERTIES Profits on sale of properties are taken into account on the completion of contract, and are calculated by reference to the carrying value at the end of the previous year, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 62 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 1 CONTINUED PLANT, EQUIPMENT AND OWNER-OCCUPIED PROPERTY Owner-occupied property held under a finance lease is stated at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is generally between three and five years, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term.
INVESTMENTS Investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
Where a significant or prolonged decline in fair value is identified, the investment is considered impaired and any cumulative revaluation gain or deficit is recycled through the income statement.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLANS Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans comprises the amount of future benefit that employees have earned, discounted to determine a present value, less the fair value of the pension plan assets.
The discount rate used is the yield on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified external actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in equity.
Where the assets of a plan are greater than its obligation, the asset included in the balance sheet is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reduction in future contributions to the plan.
SHARE-BASED EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION Share-based employee remuneration is determined with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted and charged to the income statement over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.
The fair value of share-based employee remuneration is calculated using the binomial option pricing model and is dependent on factors including the exercise price, expected volatility, option life and risk-free interest rate.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied to share options granted from November 2002.
TAX Tax is included in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.

The costs were previously included within current receivables.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 64 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS 3 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SEGMENTS The Groups reportable segments are the geographic locations and sectors in which it operates, which are generally managed by separate teams.
Gross rental income represents the Groups revenue from external customers or tenants.
Net rental income is the principal profit measure used to determine the performance of each sector.
Resource allocation is based on the distribution of property assets between segments.
The income from a significant contract is noted in Contractual relationships on page 12.

UK deferred tax at 31 December 2008 has been calculated at a rate of 28% reflecting the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 1 April 2008.
Following a decision of the High Court in January 2008 in favour of HM Revenue & Customs, the Group has paid tax of 37.4 million and interest of 14.6 million relating to capital gains incurred by the Grantchester Group prior to its acquisition by Hammerson.
The Group had provided for these liabilities at 31 December 2007.
The Group awaits the outcome of the Court of Appeal hearing which took place in December 2008.
Should the case be ultimately decided in the Groups favour, the tax and interest paid would be refunded.
E. UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX Deferred tax is not provided on potential gains on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures when the Group can control whether gains crystallise and it is probable that gains will not arise in the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2008 the total of such gains was 445 million and the potential tax effect 125 million 2007: 1,200 million, potential tax effect 336 million.
If a UK REIT sells a property completed after 1 January 2007 within three years of its completion, the REIT exemption will not apply.
At 31 December 2008, the value of such completed developments was 495 million 2007: nil and the potential tax charge that would arise if these properties were to be sold was nil 2007: nil.
A deferred tax asset of 25.6 million 2007: 17.7 million is not recognised for carried forward UK tax losses that may not be utilised, because it is uncertain whether appropriate taxable profits will arise.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 72 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED TAX 8 CONTINUED F. UK REIT STATUS The Group elected to be treated as a UK REIT with effect from 1 January 2007.
The UK REIT rules exempt the profits of the Groups UK property rental business from corporation tax.
Gains on UK properties are also exempt from tax, provided they are not held for trading or, for properties completed after 1 January 2007, sold within three years after completion of development.
The Group is otherwise subject to UK corporation tax.
As a REIT, Hammerson plc is required to pay Property Income Distributions equal to at least 90% of the Groups exempted net income.
On entering the REIT regime, entry tax became payable equal to 2% of the market value of the Groups qualifying UK properties at 31 December 2006.
The total entry charge of 100.5 million was paid in quarterly instalments between July 2007 and April 2008.
To remain a UK REIT there are a number of conditions to be met in respect of the principal company of the Group, the Groups qualifying activity and its balance of business which are set out in the UK REIT legislation in the Finance Act 2006.
G. FRENCH SIIC STATUS Hammerson plc has been a French SIIC since 1 January 2004 and all the major French properties are covered by the SIIC tax-exempt regime.
Income and gains are exempted from French tax but the French subsidiaries are required to distribute a proportion of their profits to Hammerson plc, which will then pay UK dividends to its shareholders.
Dividend obligations will arise principally after property disposals but there will be a period of up to four years after a sale before dividends are required to be received in the UK and a further year before dividends must be paid to shareholders.
If all the properties were realised at the 31 December 2008 values, a total of 560 million of dividends would arise 2007: 517 million.
Under current UK tax rules, Hammerson plc is taxed in the UK on dividends received from France, subject to available UK tax losses.
Deferred tax of 156.9 million 2007: 144.8 million is provided for the potential UK tax that would arise on realising the French portfolio at value.
However, the UK government is proposing to exempt foreign dividends from tax, and if enacted, this should allow virtually all the Groups net deferred tax balance to be released in 2009.
If Hammerson plc was to cease to qualify as a French SIIC before 1 January 2014, tax of approximately 260 million 2007: 74 million would be payable under a penalty regime which was strengthened in December 2008.
To continue to qualify, Hammerson plc must remain listed in France, at least 80% of assets must be employed in property investment and, from 1 January 2010 and with limited temporary exceptions, no shareholder may hold 60% or more of its shares.
DIVIDENDS 9 The proposed final dividend of 15.3 pence per share 2007: 15.3 pence per share was recommended by the Board on 9 February 2009 and, subject to approval by shareholders, is payable on 22 May 2009 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 20 February 2009.
It is intended that 3.8 pence per share will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate, and the remainder of 11.5 pence per share will be paid as a normal dividend.
Based on the proposed final dividend, the total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2008 will be 27.9 pence per share 2007: 27.3 pence per share.
The 80.7 million dividend included in the reconciliation of equity on page 57 comprises the 2007 final dividend of 44.2 million, which was paid on 23 May 2008, together with the 2008 interim dividend of 36.5 million.
The latter was paid on 30 September 2008 as a PID, and was subject to withholding tax of 5.5 million, which was paid on 14 October 2008.
On 14 January 2008, a payment of 6.0 million was made being the withholding tax arising on the 2007 interim dividend, which was also paid as a PID.

In the United Kingdom, the Groups properties were valued by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, Chartered Surveyors.
In France and Germany, the Groups properties were valued by Cushman & Wakefield, Chartered Surveyors.
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors the Standards and with IVA 1 of the International Valuation Standards.
In their valuation reports, the valuers have noted, in accordance with Guidance Note 5 of the Standards, that the primary source of evidence for valuations should be recent, comparable market transactions on arms length terms.
The current economic environment means that there have been few transactions for the types of property owned by Hammerson.
Consequently, there is a greater degree of uncertainty in respect of the figures reported by our valuers.
Until the number and consistency of comparable transactions increases, this situation is likely to remain.
Further discussion of this issue is set out in Principal risks and uncertainties on page 15.
Valuation fees are based on a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers and are independent of the portfolio value.
Summaries of the valuers reports are available on the Companys website www.
At 31 December 2008 the total amount of interest included in development properties was 22.0 million 2007: 39.8 million, calculated using the Groups average cost of borrowings.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT 20 Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Further discussion of some of these issues is set out in Principal risks and uncertainties on page 15.
The Groups risk management policies and practices with regard to financial instruments are as follows: A.
DEBT MANAGEMENT The Group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with whom Hammerson maintains strong working relationships.
Medium and long-term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the Groups debt, allowing changes from fixed to variable rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the Groups ratio of fixed to variable rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against these guidelines.
The Group has interest rate swaps of 400.0 million 2007: nil and 44.2 million 2007: 28.9 million maturing within the next five years.
Under these swaps the Group pays interest at fixed rates of 5.075% and 6.275% respectively and receives interest linked to LIBOR.
During the year, the Group also entered into a 100.0 million interest rate swap to fix its interest rate on a 100.0 million bank loan.
Under this swap, which expires in 2013, the Group pays interest at a fixed rate of 4.725% and receives interest linked to LIBOR.
In addition, at 31 December 2007 the Group had interest rate swaps of 300.0 million and 15.5 million.
The 300.0 million swaps matured in December 2008, when the swap counterparties did not exercise their option to extend the maturity of these swaps.
Under these swaps the Group received interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% and paid interest at variable rates linked to LIBOR.
The counterparties have additional options expiring in December 2010 to reinstate these rates for the period 15 December 2010 to 15 December 2016.
The 15.5 million swaps were settled at the point of repayment of the related mortgage.
Under these swaps the Group paid interest of 4.658% and received interest linked to LIBOR.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 83 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT 20 CONTINUED At 31 December 2008, the fair value of interest rate swaps was a liability of 39.7 million 2007: 6.4 million.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
C. FOREIGN CURRENCY MANAGEMENT The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by financing the cost of acquiring euro denominated assets with euro borrowings.
The Group borrows in Euros and uses currency swaps to match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities.
To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries in France and Germany, the Group has designated both euro denominated bonds and currency swaps as hedges.
The carrying amount of the bonds at 31 December 2008 was 674.9 million 2007: 878.5 million and their fair value was 464.8 million 2007: 825.3 million.
At 31 December 2008 the Group had currency swaps of 533.8 million, being 594.2 million sold forward against sterling: 304.2 million for value in March 2009 at a rate of 1 1.106 and 290.0 million for value in June 2009, at a rate of 1 1.120.
At 31 December 2007 the Group had swaps of 442.8 million, being 609.0 million sold forward against sterling: 14.8 million for value in January 2008, at a rate of 1 1.388 and 594.2 million for value in June 2008, at a rate of 1 1.384.
The fair value of currency swaps is detailed in note 20I.
The exchange differences on hedging instruments and on net investments are recognised in equity.
D. PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT AND BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT The Group maintains internal guidelines for interest cover and gearing.
Management monitors the Groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
Further details of these ratios are provided in the Financial Review on pages 34 and 35.
E. CASH MANAGEMENT AND LIQUIDITY Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups operational requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
Longer-term liquidity requirements are met with an appropriate mix of short and longer-term debt as detailed in note 20A above.
F. CREDIT RISK The Groups principal financial assets are bank and cash balances, short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.
The Groups credit risk is attributable to its trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments.
Trade receivables consist principally of rents due from tenants.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and the Groups tenant base is diversified geographically and by sector, with tenants generally of good financial standing.
The majority of tenant leases are long-term contracts with rents payable quarterly in advance and the average unexpired lease term at 31 December 2008 was 9.5 years 2007: 10.5 years.
Rent deposits and personal or corporate guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low.
The Groups most significant tenants are set out in the Business Review on page 27.
Loans receivable and other receivables include balances due from joint venture partners, available for sale investments and VAT receivables.
These items do not give rise to significant credit risk.
The receivables in notes 15 and 16 are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
An analysis of trade receivables and the related provisions is shown in note 16.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 84 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT 20 CONTINUED The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
At 31 December 2008, the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was 263.2 million 2007: 193.8 million.

H. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 December 2008, it is estimated that an increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have increased the Groups annual profit before tax by 6.5 million 2007: decrease of 22.3 million and a decrease of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Groups annual profit before tax by 4.0 million 2007: increase of 15.9 million.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
The decrease in the Groups annual profit before tax with a reduction in interest rates is due to the change in fair value of interest rate swaps having a greater charge than the saving on floating rate borrowings.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 85 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT 20 CONTINUED It is estimated that, in relation to financial instruments alone, a 10% strengthening of sterling against the euro, would have reduced the net loss taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2008 by 192.0 million 2007: 145.2 million.
A 10% weakening of sterling against the euro would have increased the net loss taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2008 by 234.7 million 2007: 177.5 million.
In relation to financial instruments alone, there would have been no impact on the Groups profit before tax.
This has been calculated by retranslating the year end euro denominated financial instruments at a year end foreign exchange rate changed by 10%.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in this estimate.
However, the effects noted above would be more than offset by the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on the euro denominated net assets included in the financial statements of Hammerson plc.
FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair values of borrowings together with their carrying amounts included in the balance sheet are as follows: 2008 2007 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m 0.2 0.2 Current borrowings 399.9 402.1 Non-current borrowings 3,438.4 2,824.6 2,133.5 2,040.0 Unamortised borrowing costs 19.3 19.3 16.0 16.0 Currency swaps 33.3 33.3 6.8 6.8 Total borrowings 3,452.6 2,838.8 2,524.2 2,432.9 Interest rate swaps 39.7 39.7 6.4 6.4 The fair values of the Groups borrowings have been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices.
The fair values of the Groups outstanding interest rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates.
Details of the Groups cash and short-term deposits are set out in note 17.
Their fair values and those of other financial assets and liabilities equate to their book values.
Details of the Groups receivables are set out in notes 15 and 16.

ANNUAL REPORT 2008 92 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED POST BALANCE SHEET EVENT 29 On 9 February 2009, the Company announced its proposal to raise 608.7 million through a fully underwritten rights issue on the basis of 7 New Shares for every 5 Existing Shares.
Should the proposal be ratified at a General Meeting on 25 February 2009, the Directors intend that the net proceeds of 584.2 million would be used to reduce indebtedness.
The pro forma balance sheet at 31 December 2008 is shown below, on the assumption that the rights issue proceeds.

2 The net proceeds of the rights issue are calculated on the basis that the Company issues 405,796,774 New Shares at 1.50 per New Share and that transaction expenses are 24.5 million.
3 The pro forma financial information takes no account of the results of the Company for the period subsequent to 31 December 2008, or of any other change in its financial position in that period.
4 EPRA NAV per share has been calculated as equity shareholders funds, diluted for the effects of unexercised share options, adjusted for the fair value of derivatives and deferred tax, divided by the diluted number of shares in issue as at 31 December 2008 and following the rights issue.
5 Pro forma dividend per share has been calculated by adding the interest saved from the use of the rights issue proceeds to reduce indebtedness, 31.5 million calculated as 584.2 million at the Groups average cost of borrowing of 5.4%, to 2008 adjusted earnings of 110.3 million and dividing by 2008 dividend cover of 1.36 times and by the total number of shares in issue following the rights issue of 695.7 million.
