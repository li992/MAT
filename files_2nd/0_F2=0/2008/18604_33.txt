Unless previously redeemed, converted, purchased or cancelled the bond is convertible at any time up to 12 May 2014 into fully paid up ordinary shares at a conversion price of 8.64.
The convertible bond is a compound financial instrument and the carrying amount has been allocated to its equity and liability components in the group balance sheet.
The liability component has been determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component.
The discount rate used for this was based on a rate of 7.5% compounded semi-annually.
The liability component has been deducted from the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the residual element has been assigned to the equity component.
The liability element is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Since the year end, holders of 87.1m of the 112m 3.625% 2014 convertible bond have accepted a cash payment of 35,000 per 100,000 nominal bond value to convert early see note 40.
