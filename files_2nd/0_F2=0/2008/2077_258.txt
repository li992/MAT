section 3 resourcing the future For several years now, emerging Asian economies have accounted for a substantial proportion of global growth.
This year, China alone will account for more global growth than has the United States and this growth will drive the course of the world economy for years to come.
As part of achieving remarkable rates of economic growth, China is successfully reducing poverty across its population of more than one billion people.
To achieve this growth, China and other fast-developing economies rely on natural resources that, for the most part, they have to import.
These resources include iron ore, copper, nickel, alumina, manganese, coal, oil and gas.
BHP Billiton produces and supplies the developing economies with these natural resources.
As the worlds leading resources company, we are central to the growth of the worlds developing economies.
We really are resourcing the future.
