Ten largest investments The table below provides information on our ten largest investments in respect of the Group's holding and excluding any managed or advised external funds.
The valuation basis provides further information on how the Groups valuation has been derived.
Income represents dividends received inclusive of overseas withholding tax and gross interest receivable in the year to 31 March 2008.
Net assets and earnings figures are taken from the most recently audited accounts of the investee business, and are the net assets of each business and the total earnings on ordinary activities after tax respectively.
It should be noted that, because of the varying rights attached to the classes of shares held by the Group, it could be misleading to attribute a certain proportion of the earnings and net assets to the proportion of equity capital held by the Group.
Further information on our portfolio investments is provided as case studies within the Business review section, and more generally at 3i.
