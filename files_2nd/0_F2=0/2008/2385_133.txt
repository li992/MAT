Global reserves Volatile prices The idea that the world has reached or passed the point of peak oil has become commonplace, yet there are more than enough 2008 saw volatile energy price movements.
Crude oil prices rose resources to meet oil demand for decades.

Following this mid-year peak, the unsettled financial markets and Improved recovery factors and new discoveries have resulted in wider economic uncertainty saw the price drop back to $36.55 increased proved oil reserves in 22 of the past 25 years, growing at the end of the year.
This volatility was also mirrored in the gas in aggregate by more than 70% over that period.
To meet demand, a market, with the average US natural gas price for 2008 increasing government, energy companies and industry must work together to bring further reserves of oil and gas to market.

Energy diversity All available primary energy sources will be needed to address the twin challenges of energy security and climate change.
In the medium term, there is no economically viable substitute for oil in the transportation sector at scale.
Coal will provide a secure energy source for many consuming countries but it is also a major source of GHG emissions.
Gas produces lower emissions than coal, but gas reserves are concentrated in a few countries.
Alternatives such as wind, solar and biofuels are growing fast, but these renewable sources, together with geothermal energy, account for just 2% of current primary energy supply.
Conservation in all sectors can help reduce future energy demand.
Energy security Global energy demand by type Around 70% of the worlds proved oil reserves are located in just million tonnes of oil equivalent seven countries and 55% of the worlds proved gas reserves are found in three countries.
While current levels of demand are being 0 4000 8000 12000 16000 20000 met, 2008 saw ongoing anxieties around the potential effects of political instability in key energy producing regions.

But, while demand and gas production alone.
While this appears for energy grows, there is suf cient evidence that human activity to be a daunting gure, many oil and gas companies and global warming are connected, particularly that the use of are already spending at a pace consistent with fossil fuels contributes about 60% of all GHG emissions.

In order to achieve this goal, the world will have to and skills needed to address increasingly decarbonize future energy supplies using a variety of options demanding engineering and technical issues.
Innovation will play an essential role in enabling energy conservation, nuclear power and renewables such as energy companies to nd reserves, get more wind, solar, biofuels and CCS.
If the costs of GHG emissions were from each new eld, maximize the contribution included in the price we pay for everyday activities from travelling from mature assets and enhance the way we by train to switching on lights consumer behaviour would begin transport, re ne and distribute products.

There is also a need for transitional incentives to bring forward the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies, as some of these Capability gap will initially require a higher carbon price than that created by a cap-and-trade system.
Capability is one of the greatest issues facing the energy industry.
