The historical amounts listed in the table apply to the ordinary shares, as the American Depositary Shares were not issued until October 2007 as described above under Trading Market.
2 Final dividends for each year were proposed in the indicated year and paid in the following year.
In September 2008, the company issued new ordinary shares by way of a capitalisation issue rather than paying an interim dividend.
In December 2008, the company issued Series 2 non-cumulative preference shares of 1 each to HM Treasury, with an attached condition that no dividend is paid to ordinary shareholders until those preference shares are no longer in issue, unless otherwise agreed by HM Treasury.
The company has reached agreement with HM Treasury to replace the Series 2 non-cumulative preference shares held by HM Treasury with new ordinary shares.
Following redemption, the dividend restriction on ordinary shares will be removed.
However, it is currently the Boards intention not to pay any ordinary dividends for 2009.
