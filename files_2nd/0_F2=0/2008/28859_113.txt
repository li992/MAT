and ABN AMROs asset management business were identified as disposal groups on the acquisition of ABN AMRO and sold during 2008.
In addition, under the terms of the Consortium and Shareholders Agreement, consortium members other than the Group agreed to acquire, in due course, various ABN AMRO businesses including operations in Brazil sold 1 July 2008, the commercial and retail businesses in the Netherlands, the private clients business and Interbanca.
2 The initial accounting for the acquisition was determined provisionally at 31 December 2007 because of its complexity and the limited time available between the acquisition and the preparation of the 2007 financial statements.
The principal adjustments, excluding reclassifications, on finalising fair values were: a The Groups methodology for calculating the fair value of trading financial instruments produced values lower by 524 million than those recorded by ABN AMRO: b Following further work on identifying intangible assets, additional customer relationship assets and core deposit intangibles of 724 million have been recognised: c Net assets of the Netherlands pension scheme have been reduced by 250 million.
d The fair value of private equity investments was reduced by 98 million based on additional evidence provided by disposals in 2008: e The liability for instruments issued by conduits should be increased by 366 million: No material change was required to the deferred tax effect of fair value adjustments.
It is estimated that the Group would have reported total income of 37.2 billion and profit after tax of 7.7 billion from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2007 had all acquisitions occurred on 1 January 2007.
These results would not have been materially affected by the finalisation of fair values.
