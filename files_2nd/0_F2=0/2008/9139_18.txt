64 KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 | RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS 8 Kier operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as disclosed below: Kier Group Pension Scheme This is the principal scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution plan.
The assets of the Scheme are held under trust separately from those of the Group: the Trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investment managers.
The defined benefit section of the Scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002: existing members continue to accrue benefits for future service.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by the Trustees independent actuaries as at 1 April 2005 using the projected unit method.
The market value of the schemes assets at that date were 369.8m which represented approximately 82% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries.
The contributions paid during the year were 17.1m 2007: 24.0m which include special contributions of 6.0m 2007: 11.0m.
Going forward contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2005 valuation date not covered by the above special contributions over a ten-year period to March 2016.
The Group expects to pay contributions for future service of 12.6m being 19.1% of pensionable pay plus 6.0m for funding the past service deficit in the year to June 2009.
The Pension Protection Fund PPF levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Following closure of the defined benefit section of the Scheme to new entrants most new employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme.
The Group is required to pay contributions in respect of those employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
The contributions paid during the year and the pension charge, amounted to 4.9m 2007: 3.9m.
Kier Sheffield LLP Kier participates in this defined benefits scheme through its subsidiary Kier Sheffield LLP which has participated as an admitted body in the South yorkshire Pension Fund since 1 April 2003.
As an admitted body it was granted a fully funded past service position at that date, with assets and ongoing past service liabilities of 65.0m.
The scheme covers 1,146 employees who transferred from Sheffield Councils employment to Kier Sheffield LLP upon the start of the contract.
New employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme.
Kier Sheffield LLP is required to pay contributions in respect of these employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
Kier Sheffield LLPs pension costs in respect of the defined benefit scheme are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the project unit method.
The contributions paid during the year were 1.1m 2007: 1.6m.
Going forward Kier Sheffield LLP expects to pay contributions for future service at the rate of 11.5% of pensionable pay which the funds actuary has determined is sufficient to meet ongoing benefits.
Other schemes Contributions are also made in respect of hourly paid operatives to an industry-wide stakeholder pension scheme, and in respect of employees who are members of a local government pension scheme.
The pension costs for these have been taken as the actual contributions paid over the year.

| FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 26 Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
78 KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 | FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 26 Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major ratings agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counter party are within predetermined limits.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts.
There is no Group-wide rate of provision, and provision made for debts that are overdue is based on prior default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below: 2008 2007 m m Provision as at 1 July 2.1 2.4 Increase in provision during the year 0.2 Provision utilised during the year Provision released during the year 0.7 0.3 Provision as at 30 June 1.6 2.1 There are 63.7m of trade receivables that were overdue at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against, of which 41.3m had been received by the end of August 2008.
There are no indications as at 30 June 2008 that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are overdue and unprovided.
The proportion of trade receivables at 30 June 2008 that were overdue for payment was 23%.
Credit terms vary across the Group: the average age of trade receivables was as follows: Construction 48 days 2007: 43 days Support Services 38 days 2007: 34 days Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Group has hedged its exposure to interest rate movements through a private placement of 30.2m of loan notes for ten years from February 2003, which bear interest on a fixed rate basis at 6.4% p. a.
The balance of the Groups borrowings are to finance short-term working capital requirements.
Such borrowings are subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
In addition, a number of the Groups PFI and Property joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates primarily within the UK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where foreign currency exposures are identified these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium-term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of unsecured committed borrowing facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.

Interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of between 25 and 30 years and are without recourse to the Group.
At 30 June 2008 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interest-bearing debts against which interest rate derivatives are held is 156.4m.
The Groups share of the total net fair value asset of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 2008 amounted to 2.3m which, together with the related deferred tax liability of 0.6m, have met the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been recognised directly in equity.
Financial assets and liabilities analysis by currency and maturity dates At 30 June 2008 the Group had cash, overdrafts and long-term borrowings denominated in the following currencies: 2008 2008 2007 2007 Financial Financial 2008 Financial Financial 2007 assets liabilities Aggregate assets liabilities Aggregate m m m m m m Currency: Sterling 162.2 16.8 145.4 166.3 16.8 149.5 US dollar 2.8 13.4 10.6 1.2 13.4 12.2 Euro 2.3 2.3 9.4 9.4 Other 6.8 6.8 1.7 1.7 Total 174.1 30.2 143.9 178.6 30.2 148.4 There is no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of the Groups aggregate financial assets and liabilities.
The financial liabilities represent a 17.0m UK sterling loan and a 13.4m US dollar loan, net of 0.2m of capitalised finance costs, from the private placement of loan notes made in February 2003.
The loans are repayable in one payment in February 2013.
The UK sterling loan is at a fixed interest rate of 6.4% for the term of the loan.
The Group has entered into interest payment and repayment swaps for the US dollar loan, which give an effective 6.4% fixed interest rate for the term of the loan.
The remaining financial assets and liabilities are cash, short-term deposits and overdrafts at floating rates based on LIBOR.
Borrowing facilities The Group has 102.5m 2007: 107.5m of unsecured committed borrowing facilities due for renewal as follows: Undrawn facility m 2009 10.0 2011 92.5 102.5 In addition the Group has 12.5m 2007: 12.5m of unsecured overdraft facilities repayable on demand.
