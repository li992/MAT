The carrying value of borrowings is deemed to be a good approximation of the fair value.
Borrowings can be repaid within six months if the Group decides not to rollover for further periods up to the contractual repayment date.
The impact of discounting would therefore be negligible.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as a result of the derivative transaction.
For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
