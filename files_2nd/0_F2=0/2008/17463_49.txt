Therefore, cash available for the Groups 100% owned operations is dependent on the periodic distributions from the Enterprise Partnerships, all of whom have a 100% distribution policy.
At 31 December 2008, the Group held 75,252,000 of cash available in 100% owned operations 2007: 57,436,000 including 25,502,000 cash held in escrow see below.
Included within cash and cash equivalents is an amount of 25,502,000 which is held in an escrow account.
This amount is equivalent to the maximum consideration that may have to be paid out under the Open Offer process relating to the acquisition of Cambridge Solutions Ltd see note 39 for details, assuming full take-up under the Open Offer.
The Group has entered into an escrow agreement which delegates responsibility for the maintenance and management of this escrow account to an escrow agent, including the ability, to the exclusion of all others, to make payments or appropriations from this account.
Once the Open Offer process has been completed, any funds deposited in the escrow account in excess of those payments made to shareholders who take up the offer will be refunded to the Group.
This is expected to occur by 31 March 2009.
