The change in the weighted average rate year on year relates to the mix of profit and loss in each jurisdiction.
The effective tax rate for UK ring fence profits is 50 per cent.
There are no significant unrecognised temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
The amount of unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the balance sheet in the absence of suitable forecast profits is US$6.8 million in the UK 2007: US$12.7 million.
This gives rise to a potential deferred tax asset of US$1.9 million 2007: US$3.8 million.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 60 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2008 7 Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows: Weighted average Profit after tax number of shares Earnings per share 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 $ million $ million million million cents cents Basic 98.3 39.0 81.4 82.0 120.8 47.6 Outstanding share options 0.8 1.2 Diluted 98.3 39.0 82.2 83.2 119.6 46.9 The inclusion of the outstanding share options in the 2008 and 2007 calculations produces a diluted earnings per share.
The outstanding share options number includes any expected additional share issues due to future share-based payments.
At 31 December 2008 8,003,434 2007: 8,003,434 potential Ordinary Shares in the company that are underlying the companys convertible bonds and that may dilute earnings per share in the future have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they are anti-dilutive for the year to 31 December 2008.

These amounts are written off to the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.

The impairment loss relates to the Chinguetti field in Mauritania.
The impairment charge was calculated by reference to an assessment of the future discounted cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves measured against the carrying value of the asset.
The future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate.
Estimates involved in impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves, future oil and gas prices, costs and timing which are inherently uncertain.
Amortisation and depreciation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves at the end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis.
Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.

The borrowings are repayable as follows: 2008 2007 $ million $ million Borrowings analysed by maturity: Bank loans in the third year 53.0 Convertible bonds in the sixth year 2007: seventh year 206.4 200.0 Total borrowings 206.4 253.0 The groups principal bank facilities are US$275 million and 53 million 2007: US$275 million and 53 million.
The original facility was taken out on 13 September 2005 and amended in April 2007 and will continue until 31 July 2010.
The facilities are unsecured and bear a floating interest rate based on LIBOR.
Convertible bonds In June 2007, the group issued bonds at a par value of US$250 million which are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the company at any time from 6 August 2007 until six days before their maturity date of 27 June 2014.
At the initial conversion price of 15.82 per share there are 8,003,434 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds.
If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will be redeemed at par value on 27 June 2014.
Interest of 2.875 per cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to that date.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bonds were split between a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue.
The fair value of the liability component was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, was included in equity reserves.
Issue costs were apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component was charged directly against equity.
2008 2007 $ million $ million Liability component at 1 January 195.6 Nominal value of convertible bonds issued net of issue costs 244.0 Equity component 51.8 Liability component at date of issue 195.6 192.2 Interest charged 14.2 7.0 Interest paid 7.1 3.6 Total liability component as at 31 December 202.7 195.6 Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 65 14 Borrowings continued The total interest charged for the year has been calculated by applying an effective annual interest rate of 6.73 per cent 2007: 6.73 per cent to the liability component for the period since the bonds were issued.
The non-cash accrual of interest will increase the liability component as the cash interest is only paid at 2.875 per cent to US$250 million at maturity.
There is no material difference between the carrying amount of the liability component of the convertible bonds and their fair value.
This fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate.

Further details of this plan are disclosed in note 19.
The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK, West Africa and Pakistan oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred up to 2032.
These provisions have been created based on Premiers internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which the management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 66 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2008 17 Financial instruments Hedging instruments The groups activities expose it to financial risks of changes, primarily in oil and gas prices but also foreign currency exchange and interest rates.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain of these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
Premier undertakes oil and gas price hedging periodically within Board limits to protect operating cash flow against weak prices.
Oil and gas hedging is undertaken with collar options.
Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price options.
Indonesian gas is hedged using HSFO Singapore 180cst which is the variable component of the gas price.
Oil production a Production from 2009 to 2012 is now 60 per cent hedged.
For the years 2009 and 2012 production is now hedged with an average floor of US$39.3 bbl and a cap of US$100.0 bbl.
b At the end of 2007 an off-take agreement was agreed in which the parameters of the above hedges were embedded.
This agreement is for four and a half years effective from 1 July 2008 and replaces the financially-settled hedges for that period.
c A further option agreement which has the effect of closing out the floor and cap in the original financially-settled hedges previously in place.
d The value at 31 December 2008 of the option agreement is US$33.6 million 2007: US$37.9 million.
This represents deferred income which will be amortised over the life of the off-take agreement.
For the year ended 31 December 2008 a total of US$4.3 million was released to the income statement 2007: US$nil in respect of this deferred income.
Indonesian gas production Production from 2009 to mid-year 2013 is now 34 per cent hedged with a floor of US$250.0 mt and a cap of US$500.0 mt.
During the year gas hedges matured generating a cash cost of US$7.8 million 2007: US$42,300 and oil hedges matured generating a cash cost of US$8.1 million 2007: US$nil.
While all hedges were assessed to be effective, all movements in the fair values have been recognised in the income statement, as all such movements relate to the time-value portion of hedges under IAS 39.

Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
The estimated fair values have been determined using market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
Values recorded are as at the balance sheet date, and will not necessarily be realised.
Non-interest bearing financial instruments, which include amounts receivable from customers, and accounts payable are recorded materially at fair value reflecting their short-term maturity and are not shown in the above table.
Credit risk The groups credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and its bank deposits.
The amounts of receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables which were immaterial in 2008 and 2007.
The group does not require collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with at least single A credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The maturity profile of the groups trade and other receivables and trade and other payables as at 31 December, including the related interest amounts, was: Less than 2 to 3 3 months 1 to 5 Over 5 1 month months to 1 year years years Total $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million 2008: Trade and other receivables 88.7 29.8 5.2 123.7 Trade and other payables 75.5 4.7 4.6 84.8 Convertible bonds 7.2 28.8 253.6 289.6 Total 13.2 25.1 6.6 28.8 253.6 250.7 2007: Trade and other receivables 139.9 26.3 25.1 191.3 Trade and other payables 64.9 8.7 14.6 88.2 Convertible bonds 7.2 28.8 260.8 296.8 Total 75.0 17.6 3.3 28.8 260.8 193.7 Currency risk To cover sterling exposures an amount of 105.0 million was purchased with forward contracts during the year 2007: 57.1 million.
Premiers activities are largely conducted in US dollars.
All borrowings at year-end were denominated in US dollars to match the currency of the assets.
Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and future capital and operating commitments.

There has been no new issue of shares in relation to the Asset and Equity Plan.
Share option plans The company has share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the companys shares have been granted to certain executives and employees.
Options granted are normally exercisable not less than three years after their grant and will lapse on their tenth anniversary.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the scheme.
Employees can save to a maximum of 250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2008 had a weighted average exercise price of 4.69 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.6 years.
The fair value of the options granted during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is not material.
The group recognised a cost of US$20.1 million and US$7.8 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2008 and 2007 respectively.
Asset and Equity Plan The Asset and Equity Plan is designed to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period and is operated by reference to two bonus pools an equity bonus pool and an asset bonus pool.
The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share of the company over a three-year period.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 29.0% to 31.5% Risk free rate of interest: 4.1% to 4.9% Historic market value growth factor: 99.0% to 109.0% Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 72 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2008 19 Share capital continued For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the total cost recognised by the company for share-based payments is US$25.6 million 2007: US$15.7 million with a cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$16.3 million 2007: US$18.3 million.
A credit of US$20.1 million has been recorded in equity 2007: US$7.8 million for all equity-settled payments for the group.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil group.
Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the income statement as exploration expense, operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
Ordinary Shares The rights and restrictions attached to the Ordinary Shares are as follows: Dividend rights The rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other in relation to dividends.
Winding up or reduction of capital On a return of capital on a winding up or otherwise other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares the rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares to participate in the distribution of the assets of the company available for distribution shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other.
Voting rights The holders of Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at any General Meeting of the company.

The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
As a consequence of being closed to new entrants, the current service costs of the Scheme under the IAS 19 Employee Benefits valuation will increase as the members approach retirement.
The pension costs for the Scheme are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The most recent formal valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2008 using the Attained Age Method and a market-related funding basis, of which the principal financial assumptions were investment return: 5.9 per cent pa, salary growth: 5.4 per cent pa and pension increases: 3.4 per cent pa.
The market value of the Schemes assets was 14.9 million and, on the specific method and assumptions adopted, the assets covered 91 per cent of the members accrued benefits based on projected pensionable salaries.
Until October 2008, the employer contributed to the Scheme at the rate of 19 per cent of pensionable salaries together with an additional 28,000 paid per month.
In October a new Schedule of Contributions was put in place.
At this point the employer paid a one-off lump sum contribution of 1.3 million and started to contribute at a rate of 25 per cent of pensionable salaries with no additional monthly amounts.
The employer expects to contribute 95,000 to the Scheme in 2009.
