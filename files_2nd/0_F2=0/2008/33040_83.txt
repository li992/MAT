Openreach In the Undertakings given to Ofcom on 22 September 2005, BT agreed that the incentive elements of the remuneration of employees within Openreach should be linked to Openreach performance rather than BT targets or share price.
Long-term incentive arrangements are linked to Openreach targets and are paid in cash instead of shares and hence are neither equity settled or cash settled share based payment arrangements.
