VALUATIONS continued Valuation methodology C&W have adopted different approaches for the valuation of the leasehold and freehold assets as follows: Freehold The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow of the net operating income over a ten year period and notional sale of the asset at the end of the tenth year.
Net operating income is based on projected revenue received less projected operating costs together with a central administration charge representing 6% of the estimated annual revenue.
The initial net operating income is calculated by estimating the net operating income in the first 12 months following the valuation date.
The net operating income in future years is calculated assuming straight line absorption from day one actual occupancy to an estimated stabilised mature occupancy level.
In the valuation the assumed stabilised occupancy level for the 48 stores both freeholds and leaseholds averages 85.80% 2007: 86.06%.
The projected revenues and costs have been adjusted for estimated cost inflation and revenue growth.
C. The capitalisation rates applied to existing and future net cash flow have been estimated by reference to underlying yields for industrial and retail warehouse property, bank base rates, ten year money rates, inflation and the available evidence of transactions in the sector.
On average, for all 48 stores, the yield net of purchasers costs arising from the first year of the projected cash flow is 4.21% 2007: 5.24%.
This rises to 7.02% 2007: 6.80% based on the projected cash flow for the first year following estimated stabilisation in respect of each property.
D. The future net cash flow projections including revenue growth and cost inflation have been discounted at a rate that reflects the risk associated with each asset.
The weighted average annual discount rate adopted for both freeholds and leaseholds is 10.36% 2007: 10.19%.
E. Purchasers costs of 5.75% see below have been assumed initially and sale plus purchasers costs totalling 6.75% are assumed on the notional sales in the tenth year in relation to the freehold stores.
Leasehold The same methodology has been used as for freeholds, except that no sale of the assets in the tenth year is assumed but the discounted cash flow is extended to the expiry of the lease.
The average unexpired term of the Groups seven short leaseholds is 17.7 years March 2007: nine short leaseholds, 18.8 years.
Valuation assumption for purchasers costs The Groups investment property assets have been valued for the purposes of the financial statements after deducting notional purchasers cost of 5.75% of gross value, as if they were sold directly as property assets.
The valuation is an asset valuation which is entirely linked to the operating performance of the business.
They would have to be sold with the benefit of operational contracts, employment contracts and customer contracts, which would be very difficult to achieve except in a corporate structure.
We believe therefore that the valuation assumptions should be adjusted to reflect the reality.
This approach follows the logic of the valuation methodology in that the valuation is based on a capitalisation of the net operating income after allowing a deduction for operational cost and an allowance for central administration costs.
Sale in a corporate structure would result in a reduction in the assumed Stamp Duty Land Tax but an increase in other transaction costs reflecting additional due diligence resulting in a reduced notional purchasers cost of 2.75% of gross value.
All the significant sized transactions that have been concluded in the UK in recent years were completed in a corporate structure.
We therefore instructed C&W to carry out a Red Book valuation on the above basis, and this results in a higher property valuation at 31 March 2008 of 784,550,000 33,640,000 higher than the value recorded in the financial statements or 28.4 pence per share.
We have included this revised valuation in the adjusted diluted net asset calculation see note 12.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES continued Trade receivables The Group does not typically offer credit terms to its customers and hence the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk.
All customers are required to pay in advance of the storage period.
A late charge of 10% is applied to a customers account if they are greater than 10 days overdue in their payment.
The Group provides for receivables on a specific basis.
There is a right of lien over the customers goods, so if they have not paid within a certain time frame, we have the right to sell the items they store to recoup the debt owed by the customer.
Trade receivables that are overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference to past default experience.
For individual storage customers, the Group does not perform credit checks, however this is mitigated by the fact that all customers are required to pay in advance, and also to pay a deposit ranging from between 1 weeks to 4 weeks storage income.
Before accepting a new business customer who wishes to use a number of the Groups stores, the Group uses an external credit rating to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
There are no customers who represent more than 5 per cent of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 167,000 2007: 132,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group holds a right of lien over the customers goods if these debts are not paid.
The average age of these receivables is 29 days past due 2007: 34 days past due.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables 2008 2007 000 000 0 30 days 112 73 30 60 days 26 30 60 days 29 29 Total 167 132 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts 2008 2007 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the period 33 4 Impairment losses recognised 29 Amounts written off as uncollectible 29 Balance at the end of the period 4 33 The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
