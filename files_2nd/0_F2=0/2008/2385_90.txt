Derivative financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges At 31 December 2008, the group held currency forwards and futures contracts and cylinders that were being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast transactions, as well as cross-currency interest rate swaps to fix the US dollar interest rate and US dollar redemption value, with matching critical terms on the currency leg of the swap with the underlying non-US dollar debt issuance.
Note 28 outlines the management of risk aspects for currency and interest rate risk.
For cash flow hedges the group only claims for the intrinsic value on the currency with any fair value attributable to time value taken immediately to profit or loss.
There were no highly probable transactions for which hedge accounting has been claimed that have not occurred and no significant element of hedge ineffectiveness requiring recognition in the income statement.
For cash flow hedges the pre-tax amount removed from equity during the period and included in the income statement is a loss of $45 million 2007 gain of $74 million and 2006 gain of $93 million.
Of this, a loss of $1 million is included in production and manufacturing expenses 2007 $143 million gain and 2006 $162 million gain and a loss of $44 million is included in finance costs 2007 $69 million loss and 2006 $69 million loss.
The amount removed from equity during the year and included in the carrying amount of non-financial assets was a gain of $38 million 2007 $40 million gain and 2006 $6 million gain.
The amounts retained in equity at 31 December 2008 are expected to mature and affect the income statement by a $826 million loss in 2009, a loss of $92 million in 2010 and a loss of $182 million in 2011 and beyond.
Fair value hedges At 31 December 2008, the group held interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk on fixed rate debt issued by the group.
The effectiveness of each hedge relationship is quantitatively assessed and demonstrated to continue to be highly effective.
The gain on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in 2008 was $2 million 2007 $334 million gain and 2006 $257 million gain offset by a loss on the fair value of the finance debt of $20 million 2007 $327 million loss and 2006 $257 million loss.
The interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps have an average maturity of three to four years, 2007 one to two years and are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Australian dollar denominated borrowings into US dollar floating rate debt.
Note 28 outlines the groups approach to interest rate risk management.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The group holds currency swap contracts as a hedge of a long-term investment in a UK subsidiary expiring in 2009.
At 31 December 2008, the hedge had a fair value of $2 million 2007 $40 million and the loss on the hedge recognized in equity in 2008 was $38 million 2007 $67 million loss and 2006 $105 million gain.
US dollars have been sold forward for sterling purchased and match the underlying liability with no significant ineffectiveness reflected in the income statement.

US Industrial Revenue Municipal Bonds of $3,166 million 2007 $2,880 million with earliest contractual repayment dates within one year have expected repayment dates ranging from 1 to 40 years 2007 1 to 35 years.
The bondholders typically have the option to tender these bonds for repayment on interest reset dates: however, any bonds that are tendered are usually remarketed and BP has not experienced any significant repurchases.
BP considers these bonds to represent long-term funding when internally assessing the maturity profile of its finance debt.
Similar treatment is applied for loans associated with long-term gas supply contracts totalling $1,806 million 2007 $1,899 million that mature within nine years.

These leases have terms of renewal but no purchase options and escalation clauses.
Renewals are at the option of the lessee.

Long-term borrowings in the table below include the portion of debt that matures in the year from 31 December 2008, whereas in the balance sheet the amount would be reported within current liabilities.
The carrying amount of the groups short-term borrowings, comprising mainly commercial paper, bank loans, overdrafts and US Industrial Revenue Municipal Bonds, approximates their fair value.
The fair value of the groups long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations is estimated using quoted prices or, where these are not available, discounted cash flow analyses based on the groups current incremental borrowing rates for similar types and maturities of borrowing.
