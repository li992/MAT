NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2008 CONTINUED 3.
Acquisition of subsidiaries On 30 January 2008 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Remote Controls Sweden AB RC a designer and manufacturer of valve actuators based in Falun, Sweden.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of consolidation.
In the 12 months to 31 December 2008 the subsidiary contributed 18,261,000 to Group revenue and 2,208,000 to consolidated operating profit before the 985,000 amortisation charge from the acquired intangible assets.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax as the Group manages its Treasury function on a Group basis.
Similarly it is not practicable to disclose profit attributable to equity shareholders, as acquired businesses have been merged with existing Group companies in the period since the acquisition.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2008 the results would not have been materially different.
Goodwill has arisen on this acquisition as a result of the value attributed to staff expertise and the assembled workforce, which did not meet the recognition criteria for an intangible asset, and post acquisition synergies within the Fluid Systems division.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities.
