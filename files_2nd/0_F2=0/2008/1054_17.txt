Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource Estimates At 31 December 2008 Introduction The ore reserve and mineral resource estimates presented in this report comply with the requirements of the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004 edition the JORC Code which has been used by the Group as minimum standard for the preparation and disclosure of the information contained herein.
The definitions and categories of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are set out below.
The information on ore reserves and mineral resources was prepared by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined in the JORC Code.
The Competent Persons have sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which they are undertaking.
The Competent Persons consent to the inclusion in this report of the matters based on their information in the form and context in which it appears The Competent Person for Exploration Results and Mineral Resources is Jorge Artal MAusIMM, Senior Geologist for Antofagasta Minerals S. A..
The Competent Person for Ore Reserves is Murray Canfield P. Eng.
Ontario, Technical Manager Operations for Antofagasta Minerals S. A.
The Groups operations and projects are subject to a comprehensive programme of audits aimed at providing assurance in respect of ore reserve and mineral resource estimates.
The audits are conducted by suitably qualified Competent Persons from within a particular division, another division of the Company or from independent consultants.
The ore reserve and mineral resource estimates represent full reserves and resources, not the Groups attributable share for each mine.
The Groups economic interest in each mine is disclosed in the notes following the estimates on pages 141 and 142.
The totals in the table may include some small apparent differences as the specific individual figures have not been rounded.
Definitions and Categories of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic interest in or on the Earths crust in such form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.
Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.
An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of confidence.
It is inferred from geological evidence and assumed but not verified geological and or grade continuity.
It is based on information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes which may be limited or of uncertain quality and reliability.
An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence.
It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
The locations are too widely or inappropriately spaced to confirm geological and or grade continuity but are spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed.
A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a high level of confidence.
It is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
The locations are spaced closely enough to confirm geological and grade continuity.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 138 FURTHER INFORMATION FURTHER INFORMATION Definitions and Categories of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources continued An Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured and or Indicated Mineral Resource.
It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined.
Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified.
Ore Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable Ore Reserves and Proved Ore Reserves.
A Probable Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource.
It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined.
Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified.
A Proved Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource.
The cut-off grade applied to the determination of ore reserves and mineral resources was 0.4%.
The reduction in Ore Reserves of 216 million tonnes in 2008 is due to two principal factors: 1 the extraction of 63 million tonnes of ore millfeed and low grade during 2008 and 2 a re-classification of 153 million tonnes of resources within the pit design into the Inferred Category from Measured and or Indicated.
This was due to a comprehensive review of the 2008 resource model that resulted in the application of more conservative estimation parameters to the block model.
The increase in the Mineral Resources of 1.9 billion tonnes is due to the discovery of a porphyry deposit adjacent and to the south of the Los Pelambres ore body called Frontera 1.5 billion tonnes and to the extension of known mineralisation to depth of the Los Pelambres ore body 0.4 billion tonnes.
This increase was determined as a result of a two-year, 44,324 metre drilling campaign carried out from early 2006 to early 2008.
The in the Resource Table indicates that the gold and silver grades for the Inferred Resource Category are still under review at the time of publication.
As a result of the 66% increase in Mineral Resources in 2008, Los Pelambres is in the process of a comprehensive evaluation of development alternatives for the mine.
For the 2008 Ore Reserve Estimate there has been no change to the final pit design or to the cut-off grade used in 2007. b El Tesoro El Tesoro is 70% owned by the Group 100% until 25 August 2008.
The Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are made up of the El Tesoro and Tesoro North-East deposits, which are processed by heap leaching, and the Run-of-Mine ROM Oxide Mineral Resources from the Esperanza Project, located five kilometres south-east of El Tesoro.
An agreement was entered into in 2008 whereby the Esperanza Oxide Mineral Resources were purchased by El Tesoro for a one-time payment.
Esperanza will deliver the ROM ore released during the prestripping and operating phases of the Esperanza Project to a permanent leach pad constructed and operated by the El Tesoro mine.
The reduction of 9 million tonnes in the 2008 Ore Reserve estimate is due to 11 million tonnes of ore extraction during 2008 plus a further loss of 2 million tonnes from re-optimisation of the final pit, offset by an addition of 4 million tonnes due to improved density estimation parameters in the block model.
The Esperanza Oxide Mineral Resources have been included in the El Tesoro portion of the table in 2008, along with the 2007 values for comparison that were included in the Esperanza portion last year.
The increase of 16 million tonnes in Mineral Resources is due to a change in estimation parameters that resulted in a re-distribution of tonnes within categories, decreasing the Measured Resources and increasing the Indicated and Inferred Resource categories.
c Michilla Michilla is 74.2% owned by the Group and its operations comprise an open pit mine, an underground mine and other workings.
The cut off grade applied to the determination of ore reserves and mineral resources was 0.4% for the open pit, 1.2% for the underground mine and 1.0% for other workings.
The Ore Reserve decrease of 4 million tonnes is due to 5 million tonnes of ore extraction during 2008 offset by an increase of 1 million tonnes in the Estefana deposit as a result of in-fill drilling.
Mineral Resources decreased by 1 million tonnes from 63 to 62 million tonnes due to in-fill drilling results mostly offsetting extraction losses of 5 million tonnes.
Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 141 Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource Estimates continued At 31 December 2008 d Esperanza Esperanza is 70% owned by the Group 100% until 25 August 2008.
The cut-off grade applied to the determination of ore reserves and minerals resources in 2008 was 0.2% equivalent copper.
The increase in Ore Reserves of 103 million tonnes is due to a combination of applying slightly steeper pit slope angles to a final pit design that was re-optimised with updated pricing parameters on a resource model containing more Measured and Indicated Resources Mineral Resources increased by 73 million tonnes due to a comprehensive review of the geological model and estimation parameters that resulted in a decrease in Measured and Inferred Resources and an increase in Indicated Resources.
e Reko Diq The Group holds a 50% interest in Tethyan Copper Company Limited Tethyan, its joint venture with Barrick Gold Corporation established in 2006.
Tethyans principal assets are a 75% interest in the exploration licence encompassing the Reko Diq prospects in the Chagai Hills region of South-West Pakistan in which the Government of Balochistan holds the remaining 25% including the Western Porphyries, and a 100% interest in certain other licences in the region.
A feasibility study was initiated in February 2008 and is expected to be finalised in the second half of 2009.
As part of the feasibility process, an extensive drilling programme of approximately 146,000 metres was carried out during 2008 out of an overall programme of 210,000 metres.
This included 65,000 metres of infill drilling to improve the categorisation of the existing resource estimate, 76,000 metres to support the feasibility study metallurgical test work, geotechnical and hydrogeological characterisation and condemnation drilling and 5,000 metres for new exploration.
The resource estimate for the Western Porphyries has remained approximately the same at 4.1 billion tonnes, with 1.5 billion tonnes upgraded from Inferred to Measured & Indicated Resources compared to 2007. f Other Mineral Inventory In addition to the Mineral Resources noted above, the Group has interests in other deposits located in the Antofagasta Region of Chile, some of them containing gold and or molybdenum.
At the moment they are in exploration or in the process of resource estimation.
These include: i In the Sierra Gorda District In the Sierra Gorda district the Group has one operation El Tesoro and one project under construction Esperanza and others in exploration or under study, such as: Llano Paleo Canal, Telgrafo Norte and Telgrafo Sur 70% owned by the Group: 100% until 25 August 2008 : Centinela 51% owned by the Group : Polo Sur and Mirador 100% owned by the Group and Caracoles 100% owned by the Group: 81.5% until 12 February 2009.
The Mineral Inventory of these mineral deposits is estimated to be in the range of 2.2 to 3.4 billion tonnes with grades in the range of 0.5% to 0.4% copper.
