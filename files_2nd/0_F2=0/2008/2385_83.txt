For all other financial instruments, the carrying amount is either the fair value, or approximates the fair value.
Financial risk factors The group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from natural business exposures as well as its use of financial instruments including market risks relating to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group financial risk committee GFRC advises the group chief financial officer CFO who oversees the management of these risks.
The GFRC is chaired by the CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the group treasurer and the heads of the finance, tax and the integrated supply and trading functions.
The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the group.
The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the group chief executive GCE, and via the GCE to the board, that the groups financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with group policies and group risk appetite.
142 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes on financial statements 28.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued The groups trading activities in the oil, natural gas and power markets are managed within the integrated supply and trading function, while activities in the financial markets are managed by the treasury function.
All derivative activity is carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision.
These teams are subject to close financial and management control.
The integrated supply and trading function maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk associated with trading activity.
These processes meet generally accepted industry practice and reflect the principles of the Group of Thirty Global Derivatives Study recommendations.
A policy and risk committee monitors and validates limits and risk exposures, reviews incidents and validates risk-related policies, methodologies and procedures.
A commitments committee approves value-at-risk delegations, the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.
In addition, the integrated supply and trading function undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a separate control framework as described more fully below.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business.
The market price movements that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices and other indices that could adversely affect the value of the groups financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
The group enters into derivatives in a well established entrepreneurial trading operation.
In addition, the group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its natural business exposures.
In accordance with this control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management purposes.
During recent periods of increased volatility in financial markets the groups policies in relation to managing market risk continue to be appropriate and are outlined in further detail below.
The group measures market risk exposure arising from its trading positions using value-at-risk techniques.
These techniques are based on a variance covariance model or a Monte Carlo simulation and make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a 24-hour period.
The calculation of the range of potential changes in fair value takes into account a snapshot of the end-of-day exposures and the history of one-day price movements, together with the correlation of these price movements.
The value-at-risk measure is supplemented by stress testing and tail risk analysis.
The trading value-at-risk model is used for derivative financial instrument types such as: interest rate forward and futures contracts, swap agreements, options and swaptions: foreign exchange forward and futures contracts, swap agreements and options: and oil, natural gas and power price forwards, futures, swap agreements and options.
Additionally, where physical commodities or non-derivative forward contracts are held as part of a trading position, they are also reflected in the value-at-risk model.
For options, a linear approximation is included in the value-at-risk models when full revaluation is not possible.
The value-at-risk table does not incorporate any of the groups natural business exposures or any derivatives entered into to risk manage those exposures.
Market risk exposure in respect of embedded derivatives is also not included in the value-at-risk table.
Instead separate sensitivity analyses are disclosed below.
Value-at-risk limits are in place for each trading activity and for the groups trading activity in total.
The board has delegated an overall limit of $100 million value at risk in support of this trading activity.
The high and low values at risk indicated in the table below for each type of activity are independent of each other.
Through the portfolio effect the high value at risk for the group as a whole is lower than the sum of the highs for the constituent parts.
The potential movement in fair values is expressed to a 95% confidence interval.
This means that, in statistical terms, one would expect to see a decrease in fair values greater than the trading value at risk on one occasion per month if the portfolio were left unchanged.

Natural gas swaps, options and futures are used to mitigate price risk.
Power trading is undertaken using a combination of over-the-counter forward contracts and other derivative contracts, including options and futures.
This activity is on both a standalone basis and in conjunction with gas derivatives in relation to gas-generated power margin.
In addition, NGLs are traded around certain US inventory locations using over-the-counter forward contracts in conjunction with over-the-counter swaps, options and physical inventories.
Trading value-at-risk information in relation to these activities is shown in the table above.
143 Financial statements BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes on financial statements 28.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued As described above, the group also carries out risk management of certain short-term natural business exposures using over-the-counter swaps and exchange futures contracts with a duration of less than three years.
In past periods commodity price risk relating to this activity has been managed using value-at-risk measures.
For 2008 a separate control framework is now used as described under market risk above.
For these derivative contracts the sensitivity of the net fair value to an immediate 10% increase or decrease in all reference prices would have been $90 million at 31 December 2008.
This figure does not include any corresponding economic benefit or disbenefit that would arise from the natural business exposure which would be expected to largely offset the gain or loss on the derivatives.
In addition, the group has embedded derivatives relating to certain natural gas and crude oil contracts.
The net fair value of these embedded derivatives was a liability of $1,867 million at 31 December 2008 2007 liability of $2,085 million.
Key information on the natural gas contracts is given below.
At 31 December 2008 2007 Remaining contract terms 1 year 9 months to 9 years 9 months 9 months to 11 years Contractual notional amount 3,585 million therms 3,889 million therms Discount rate nominal risk free 2.5% 4.5% For these embedded derivatives the sensitivity of the net fair value to an immediate 10% favourable or unfavourable change in the key assumptions is as follows.
$ million At 31 December 2008 2007 Discount Discount Gas price Oil price Power price rate Gas price Oil price Power price rate Favourable 10% change 291 81 27 16 317 72 37 31 Unfavourable 10% change 289 81 27 16 368 84 34 32 The sensitivities for risk management activity and embedded derivatives are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance.
In addition, for the purposes of this analysis, in the above table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the embedded derivatives is calculated independently of any change in another assumption.
In reality, changes in one factor may contribute to changes in another, which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
Furthermore, the estimated fair values as disclosed should not be considered indicative of future earnings on these contracts.
ii Foreign currency exchange risk Where the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-atrisk techniques as explained above.
This activity is described as currency trading in the value-at-risk table above.
Since BP has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have significant effects on the groups reported results.
The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and conversion differences accounted for on specific transactions.
For this reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the groups reported results.
The main underlying economic currency of the groups cash flows is the US dollar.
This is because BPs major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars.
BPs foreign currency exchange management policy is to minimize economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar.
The group co-ordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible, and then dealing with any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.
The group manages these exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and managing such risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $200 million.
At 31 December 2008, the foreign currency value at risk was $70 million 2007 $60 million.
At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the maximum risk limit.
The most significant exposures relate to capital expenditure commitments and other UK and European operational requirements, for which a hedging programme is in place and hedge accounting is claimed as outlined in Note 34.
For highly probable forecast capital expenditures the group locks in the US-dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards and futures.
The main exposures are sterling, euro, Norwegian krone, Australian dollar, Korean won and Canadian dollar, and at 31 December 2008 open contracts were in place for $949 million sterling, $553 million euro, $392 million Norwegian krone, $303 million Australian dollar, $187 million Korean won and $712 million Canadian dollar capital expenditures maturing within seven years, with over 65% of the deals maturing within two years 2007 $732 million sterling, $931 million euro, $479 million Norwegian krone, $38 million Australian dollar, $243 million Korean won and $7 million Canadian dollar capital expenditures maturing within eight years with over 80% of the deals maturing within two years.
For other UK, European, Canadian and Australian operational requirements the group uses cylinders and currency forwards to hedge the estimated exposures on a 12-month rolling basis.
At 31 December 2008, the open positions relating to cylinders consisted of receive sterling, pay US dollar, purchased call and sold put options cylinders for $1,660 million 2007 $2,800 million : receive euro, pay US dollar cylinders for $1,612 million 2007 $1,400 million : receive Canadian dollar, pay US dollar cylinders for $250 million 2007 nil : and receive Australian dollar, pay US dollar cylinders for $455 million 2007 $382 million.
At 31 December 2008, the open positions relating to currency forwards consisted of buy sterling, sell US dollar, currency forwards for $816 million 2007 nil : buy euro, sell US dollar currency forwards for $141 million 2007 nil : buy Canadian dollar, sell US dollar, currency forwards for $50 million 2007 nil : and buy Australian dollar, sell US dollar, currency forwards for $90 million 2007 nil.
In addition, most of the groups borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar.
At 31 December 2008, the total foreign currency net borrowings not swapped into US dollars amounted to $1,037 million 2007 $1,045 million.
Of this total, $92 million was denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the individual operating unit being entirely Canadian dollars 2007 $268 million, being $191 million in Canadian dollars and $77 million in Trinidad & Tobago dollars.
It is estimated that a 10% change in the corresponding exchange rates would result in an exchange gain or loss in the income statement of $9 million 2007 $27 million.
144 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes on financial statements 28.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued iii Interest rate risk Where the group enters into money market contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using value-at-risk techniques as described above.
This activity is described as interest rate trading in the value-at-risk table above.
BP is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally finance debt.
While the group issues debt in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses derivatives to swap the debt to a US dollar floating rate exposure but in certain defined circumstances maintains a fixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt.
The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2008 was 72% of total finance debt outstanding 2007 68%.
The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2008 is 3% 2007 5% and the weighted average maturity of fixed rate debt is three years 2007 two years.
The groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating rate element of the groups finance debt.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments were to have increased by 1% on 1 January 2009, it is estimated that the groups profit before taxation for 2009 would decrease by approximately $239 million 2007 $168 million decrease in 2008.
This assumes that the amount and mix of fixed and floating rate debt, including finance leases, remains unchanged from that in place at 31 December 2008 and that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the year.
Where the interest rate applicable to an instrument is reset during a quarter it is assumed that this occurs at the beginning of the quarter and remains unchanged for the rest of the year.
In reality, the fixed floating rate mix will fluctuate over the year and interest rates will change continually.
Furthermore, the effect on earnings shown by this analysis does not consider the effect of any other changes in general economic activity that may accompany such an increase in interest rates.
iv Equity price risk The group holds equity investments, typically made for strategic purposes, that are classified as non-current available-for-sale financial assets and are measured initially at fair value with changes in fair value recognized directly in equity.
Accumulated fair value changes are recycled to the income statement on disposal, or when the investment is impaired.
Impairment losses of $546 million have been recognized in 2008 relating to listed noncurrent available-for-sale investments.
For further information see Note 29.
At 31 December 2008, it is estimated that an increase of 10% in quoted equity prices would result in an immediate credit to equity of $59 million 2007 $162 million credit to equity, whilst a decrease of 10% in quoted equity prices would result in an immediate charge to profit or loss of $48 million and a charge to equity of $11 million 2007 $162 million charge to equity.
At 31 December 2008, 56% 2007 70% of the carrying amount of non-current available-for-sale financial assets represented the groups stake in Rosneft, thus the groups exposure is concentrated on changes in the share price of this equity in particular.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss to the group and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit exposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables.
The group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO, that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and control credit risk.
Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business.
On entering into any business contract the extent to which the arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered.
Key requirements of the policy are formal delegated authorities to the sales and marketing teams to incur credit risk and to a specialized credit function to set counterparty limits: the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that counterparties are rated and limits set: and systems to monitor exposure against limits and report regularly on those exposures, and immediately on any excesses, and to track and report credit losses.
The treasury function provides a similar credit risk management activity with respect to group-wide exposures to banks and other financial institutions.
In the current economic environment the group has placed increased emphasis on the management of credit risk.
Policies and processes have been reviewed during the year and credit exposures with banks and others have been reduced through netting and collateral arrangements, or reduced activity where appropriate.
Before trading with a new counterparty can start, its creditworthiness is assessed and a credit rating is allocated that indicates the probability of default, along with a credit exposure limit.
The assessment process takes into account all available qualitative and quantitative information about the counterparty and the group, if any, to which the counterparty belongs.
The counterpartys business activities, financial resources and business risk management processes are taken into account in the assessment, to the extent that this information is publicly available or otherwise disclosed to the group by the counterparty, together with external credit ratings, if any, including ratings prepared by Moodys Investor Service and Standard & Poors.
Creditworthiness continues to be evaluated after transactions have been initiated and a watchlist of higher-risk counterparties is maintained.
Once assigned a credit rating, each counterparty is allocated a maximum exposure limit.
The group does not aim to remove credit risk but expects to experience a certain level of credit losses.
The group attempts to mitigate credit risk by entering into contracts that permit netting and allow for termination of the contract on the occurrence of certain events of default.
Depending on the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the group may require collateral or other credit enhancements such as cash deposits or letters of credit and parent company guarantees.
Trade and other derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis where unconditional netting arrangements are in place with counterparties and where there is an intent to settle amounts due on a net basis.
The maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount.
At 31 December 2008, the maximum credit exposure was $52,413 million 2007 $53,498 million.
Collateral received and recognized in the balance sheet at the year-end was $1,121 million 2007 $39 million and collateral held off balance sheet was $203 million 2007 $474 million.
Credit exposure exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which amounts outstanding at 31 December 2008 were $223 million 2007 $443 million in respect of liabilities of jointly controlled entities and associates and $613 million 2007 $601 million in respect of liabilities of other third parties.
145 Financial statements BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes on financial statements 28.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued Notwithstanding the processes described above, significant unexpected credit losses can occasionally occur.
Exposure to unexpected losses increases with concentrations of credit risk that exist when a number of counterparties are involved in similar activities or operate in the same industry sector or geographical area, which may result in their ability to meet contractual obligations being impacted by changes in economic, political or other conditions.
The groups principal customers, suppliers and financial institutions with which it conducts business are located throughout the world.
In addition, these risks are managed by maintaining a group watchlist and aggregating multi-segment exposures to ensure that a material credit risk is not missed.
Reports are regularly prepared and presented to the GFRC that cover the groups overall credit exposure and expected loss trends, exposure by segment, and overall quality of the portfolio.
The reports also include details of the largest counterparties by exposure level and expected loss, and details of counterparties on the group watchlist.
It is estimated that over 80% 2007 80% of the counterparties to the contracts comprising the derivative financial instruments in an asset position are of investment grade credit quality.
Trade and other receivables of the group are analysed in the table below.
By comparing the BP credit ratings to the equivalent external credit ratings, it is estimated that approximately 60-65% 2007 65-70% of the trade receivables portfolio exposure are of investment grade quality.
With respect to the trade and other receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications as of the reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations.
The group does not typically renegotiate the terms of trade receivables: however, if a renegotiation does take place, the outstanding balance is included in the analysis based on the original payment terms.
There were no significant renegotiated balances outstanding at 31 December 2008 or 31 December 2007.

The groups liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function.
Unless restricted by local regulations, subsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to treasury, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries requirements, or invest any net surplus in the market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the groups overall net currency positions.
In managing its liquidity risk, the group has access to a wide range of funding at competitive rates through capital markets and banks.
The groups treasury function centrally co-ordinates relationships with banks, borrowing requirements, foreign exchange requirements and cash management.
The group believes it has access to sufficient funding through the commercial paper markets and by using undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements.
At 31 December 2008, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, including committed facilities of $4,950 million, of which $4,550 million are in place until at least the fourth quarter of 2011 2007 $4,950 million, of which $4,550 million are in place until at least the fourth quarter of 2011.
These facilities are with a number of international banks and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates.
The group has in place a European Debt Issuance Programme DIP under which the group may raise $20 billion of debt for maturities of one month or longer.
At 31 December 2008, the amount drawn down against the DIP was $10,334 million 2007 $10,438 million.
In addition, the group has in place a US Shelf Registration under which it may raise $10 billion of debt with maturities of one month or longer.
At 31 December 2008, the amount drawn down under the US Shelf was $6,500 million 2007 $2,500 million.
The group has long-term debt ratings of Aa1 stable outlook and AA stable outlook, 2007 Aa1 stable outlook and AA negative outlook assigned respectively by Moodys and Standard and Poors.
Despite current uncertainty in the financial market including a lack of liquidity for some borrowers, we have been able to issue $5 billion of long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2008.
In addition, we have been able to issue short-term commercial paper at competitive rates.
In the context of unforeseen market volatility, we have however, increased the cash and cash equivalents held by the group to $8.2 billion at the end of 2008 compared with $3.6 billion at the end of 2007.
The amounts shown for finance debt in the table below include expected interest payments on borrowings and the future minimum lease payments with respect to finance leases.
146 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes on financial statements 28.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued There are amounts included within finance debt that we show in the table below as due within one year to reflect the earliest contractual repayment dates but that are expected to be repaid over the maximum long-term maturity profiles of the contracts as described in Note 35.
US Industrial Revenue Municipal Bonds of $3,166 million 2007 $2,880 million with earliest contractual repayment dates within one year have expected repayment dates ranging from 1 to 40 years 2007 1 to 35 years.
The bondholders typically have the option to tender these bonds for repayment on interest reset dates: however, any bonds that are tendered are usually remarketed and BP has not experienced any significant repurchases.
BP considers these bonds to represent long-term funding when internally assessing the maturity profile of its finance debt.
Similar treatment is applied for loans associated with long-term gas supply contracts totalling $1,806 million 2007 $1,899 million that mature within nine years.
The table also shows the timing of cash outflows relating to trade and other payables and accruals.

The held-for-trading derivatives amounts in the table below represent the total contractual cash outflows by period for the purchases of physical commodities under derivative contracts and the estimated cash outflows of financially-settled derivative liabilities.
The group also holds derivative contracts for the sale of physical commodities and financially-settled derivative assets that are expected to generate cash inflows that will be available to the group to meet cash outflows on purchases and liabilities.
These contracts are excluded from the table below.
The amounts disclosed for embedded derivatives represent the contractual cash outflows of purchase contracts some of which have embedded derivatives associated with them which are financial assets.
$ million At 31 December 2008 2007  trading Embedded trading derivatives derivatives derivatives derivatives Within one year 562 60,270 699 82,465 1 to 2 years 403 8,189 659 8,541 2 to 3 years 470 2,437 641 2,906 3 to 4 years 509 1,111 627 707 4 to 5 years 535 841 624 338 5 to 10 years 1,538 2,087 2,342 592 Over 10 years 553 447 4,017 75,488 5,592 95,996 The table below shows cash outflows for derivative hedging instruments based upon contractual payment dates.
The amounts reflect the maturity profile of the fair value liability where the instruments will be settled net, and the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately to the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency interest rate swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt.
The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement day risk exposure is considered to be negligible.
