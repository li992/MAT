The Company is required to assess the carrying values of each of its investments in subsidiaries for impairment.
The net assets of certain of the Companys subsidiaries are predominantly intangible exploration and evaluation E&E assets.
Where facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an E&E asset held by a subsidiary may exceed its recoverable amount, by reference to the specific indicators of impairment of E&E assets in IFRS 6, an impairment test of the asset is performed by the subsidiary undertaking and the asset is impaired by any difference between its carrying value and its recoverable amount.
The recognition of such an impairment by a subsidiary is used by the Company as the primary basis for determining whether or not there are indications that the investment in the related subsidiary may also be impaired, and thus whether an impairment test of the investment carrying value needs to be performed.
The results of exploration activities are inherently uncertain, and the assessment for impairment of E&E assets by the subsidiary, and that of the related investment by the Company, is judgemental.
