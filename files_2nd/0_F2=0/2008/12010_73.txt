ACQUISITIONS On 5 December 2007 the entire issued share capital of Grosvenor Waste Management Limited, now renamed Viridor Resource Management Limited, was purchased by Viridor Waste Management Limited for a cash consideration of 80.0 million, including costs of 0.5 million.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method.
Viridor Resource Management Limited contributed revenues of 17.3 million and net profit of 3.1 million for the period from 5 December 2007 to 31 March 2008.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2007 Group revenues for the year would have been 908.9 million and profit for the year would have been 137.7 million.
These amounts have been calculated after applying the Groups accounting policies, adjusting the results to reflect the provisional fair value adjustments as if they had applied from 1 April 2007 and include the costs of integrating the acquisition with the existing business.
All intangible assets have been recognised at their respective provisional fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired has been recognised as goodwill.
The provisional goodwill is attributed to the profitability of the acquired business and the anticipated future operating synergies arising from the combination.
