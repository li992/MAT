HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Notes 3, 4 and 5 3 Net income from financial instruments designated at fair value Net income from financial instruments designated at fair value includes: all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value, including liabilities under investment contracts: all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are managed in conjunction with financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value: and interest income, interest expense and dividend income in respect of: financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value: and derivatives managed in conjunction with the above, except for interest arising from HSBCs issued debt securities and derivatives managed in conjunction with those debt securities, which is recognised in Interest expense.
The dilution gains therefore include a minority interest of US$71 million.
2 Subsequent to the dilution of its interests in Bank of Communications, HSBC increased its holding from 18.60 per cent to 19.01 per cent at 31 December 2007 Note 21.
In 2007, certain HSBC associates issued new shares.
HSBC did not subscribe and, as a result, its interests in the associates equity decreased.
The assets of each associate substantially increased as a result of the new share issue and, as a consequence, HSBCs share of the associates underlying net assets increased notwithstanding the reduction in the Groups proportionate ownership interests.
This increase is a gain arising from the dilution of the Groups interests in the associates, and is presented in the income statement.
