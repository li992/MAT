Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 281 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Notes to the Company financial statements Other information A Investments in subsidiaries i Movements in the Companys investments in its subsidiaries are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Fair value as at 1 January 24,466 27,886 Movement in fair value 8,113 3,420 At 31 December 16,353 24,466 ii At 31 December 2008, the Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, both incorporated in Great Britain.
These are General Accident plc and Aviva Group Holdings Limited.
Aviva Group Holdings Limited is an intermediate holding company, whilst General Accident plc no longer carries out this function.
The principal subsidiaries of the Aviva Group at 31 December 2008 are listed on pages 328 and 329.
B Operating expenses i Operating expenses Operating expenses comprise: 2008 2007 m m Staff costs and other employee related expenditure see below 86 92 Other operating costs 109 95 Net foreign exchange losses gains 83 6 Total 112 193 ii Staff costs Total staff costs were: 2008 2007 m m Wages and salaries 49 46 Social security costs 7 6 Post-retirement obligations Defined benefit schemes see iii below 6 6 Defined contribution schemes 3 2 Profit sharing and incentive plans 3 13 Equity compensation plans see iv below 11 17 Termination benefits 7 2 Total 86 92 iii Pension costs The Company is one of a number of UK companies being charged for its employees participating in the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, and its contributions are affected by the financial position of the scheme.
There is no contractual agreement or policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for this scheme across the participating Group entities but, instead, this cost is recognised in the financial statements of the main UK employing company.
The Company therefore recognises a pension expense equal to its contributions payable in the year for its staff, together with the service cost of any unfunded benefits, within staff costs above.
Full disclosure on the Groups pension schemes is given in note 46. iv Equity compensation plans All transactions in the Groups equity compensation plans involve options and awards for ordinary shares of the Company.
Full disclosure of these plans is given in note 29.
The cost of such options and awards is borne by all participating businesses and, where relevant, the Company bears an appropriate charge.
As the majority of the charge to the Company relates to directors options and awards, for which full disclosure is made in the Directors remuneration report, no further disclosure is given here on the grounds of immateriality.

The Company has unrecognised other temporary differences of 30 million 2007: nil.

Annual interest payments for these borrowings are 77 million 2007: 70 million.
The fair value of the subordinated debt at 31 December 2008 was 2,979 million 2007: 3,006 million.
The fair value of the 9.5% guaranteed bonds 2016 at 31 December 2008 was 224 million 2007: 249 million.
The fair value of the commercial paper is considered to be the same as its carrying value.
Further details of these borrowings and undrawn committed facilities can be found in note 47.
Aviva plc 284 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Company financial statements continued F Contingent liabilities Details of the Companys contingent liabilities are given in note 50 h. G Risk management Risk management in the context of the Group is considered in note 55.
The business of the Company is managing its investments in subsidiary and joint venture operations.
Its risks are considered to be the same as those in the operations themselves and full details of the risk management policies are given in note 55.
Such investments are held by the Company at fair value in accordance with accounting policy D. The fair values of the subsidiaries and joint venture are estimated using applicable valuation models, underpinned by the Companys market capitalisation.
This uses a three month rolling average of the Companys share price.
Given that the key input into the valuation model is based on an observable current share price, and therefore sensitive to movements in that price, the valuation process is not sensitive to non-observable market assumptions.
Management believes the resulting estimated fair values recorded in the balance sheet and any changes in fair values recorded in the income statement are reasonable, and are the most appropriate values at the balance sheet date.
Financial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and the joint venture, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries.
As at the balance sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired.
Financial liabilities owed by the Company as at the balance sheet date are largely in respect of borrowings details of which are provided in notes E and 47 and loans owed to subsidiaries.
Loans owed to subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate risk Loans to and from subsidiaries are at either fixed or floating rates of interest, with the latter being exposed to fluctuations in these rates.
The choice of rates is designed to match the characteristics of financial investments which are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations held in both the Company and the relevant subsidiary, to mitigate as far as possible each companys net exposure.
The majority of the Companys external borrowings are at fixed rates of interest and are therefore not exposed to changes in these rates.
However, for those borrowings that are at floating rates, the Company is affected by changes in these rates.
Further details of the Company's borrowings are provided in notes E and 47.
Currency risk The Companys direct subsidiaries are all incorporated and operating in the UK, and therefore are not exposed to currency risk.
However, these subsidiaries are themselves exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates during the course of providing insurance and asset management services around the world.
The exposure of the subsidiaries to currency risk is considered from a Group perspective in note 55.
The Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through some of its borrowings which are denominated in euros and US dollars.
However, most of these borrowings have been on-lent to a subsidiary which holds financial investments in these currencies, generating the net investment hedge described in note 56 c. H Related party transactions The Company receives dividend and interest income from subsidiaries and pays interest and fee expense to those subsidiaries in the normal course of business.
These activities are reflected in the table below.
Loans to and from subsidiaries are made on normal arms-length commercial terms.
The maturity analysis of the related party loans is as follows: Loans owed by subsidiaries 2008 2007 Maturity analysis m m Within 1 year 132 1-5 years 1,402 1,359 Over 5 years 2,015 1,248 Total 3,417 2,739 Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 285 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information Loans owed to subsidiaries 2008 2007 Principal Interest Total Principal Interest Total Maturity analysis of contractual undiscounted cash flows m m m m m m Within 1 year 975 247 1,222 1,846 258 2,104 1-5 years 2,124 593 2,717 843 334 1,177 Over 5 years 984 164 1,148 999 341 1,340 Total 4,083 1,004 5,087 3,688 933 4,621 Other related party balances comprise dividends and interest receivable and payable, as well as inter-company balances for fees and other transactions in the normal course of business.
