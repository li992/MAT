The Chairman will take questions from shareholders after proposing resolution 1.
Resolution 2 Authority to pay dividend The Directors recommend the payment of a dividend of 1.7 US cents per share to be paid on 13 March 2009 to shareholders registered on the share register at the close of business on 13 February 2009.
Resolution 3 To approve the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2008.
In line with the Directors Remuneration Regulations 2002 and Section 241A of the Companies Act 1985, the Company is required to put a resolution to approve the Directors Remuneration Report for the financial year to shareholders in a general meeting.
The Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2008 is set out on pages 45 to 50 of the Annual Report.
Resolutions 4 to 7 Reappointment of Directors These resolutions will be proposed reappointing Stephen Joubert, Wendy Lucas-Bull, Rory Scott and Dorian Wharton-Hood who retire at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
Rory Scott and Dorian Wharton-Hood are standing for election on an annual term to expire at the Annual General Meeting in 2010 as they will reach the end of their ninth year of appointment as independent non-executive directors in July 2009.
The remuneration committee will be reviewing the succession planning for independent non-executive directors during 2009.
Biographical details of each of the above directors and the rest of the Board are set out on pages 32 and 33 of the Annual Report, and other relevant information is contained in the Directors Report, the Corporate Governance Report and the Directors Remuneration Report.
Resolutions 8 and 9 Auditors Resolution 8 will, if passed, reappoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors of the Company and resolution 9 will authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration.
Company law requires that, at each general meeting at which accounts are laid, the Company should appoint auditors who will remain in office until the next general meeting at which accounts are laid.
Resolution 10 Authority to allot shares This gives Directors the general authority to allot up to 169,445,900 ordinary shares or other relevant securities being an amount approximately equal to one tenth of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 30 September 2008 exclusive of treasury shares held by the Company.
The Company did not hold treasury shares at 30 September 2008.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise the authority, other than to satisfy share options under the existing share option scheme.
This authority, if given, will expire at the next Annual General Meeting or 28 April 2010, whichever is earlier.
This resolution will be proposed as an ordinary resolution.
Resolution 11 Authority to allot the shares for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders on a pro rata basis Shares allotted for cash must normally be first offered to shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.
However, resolution 11 proposes that an authority be given to the Directors to allot shares or other equity securities for cash to persons other than existing shareholders without first offering them to existing shareholders up to a maximum of the authority granted under resolution 10.
Where the allotment is made otherwise than in connection with a rights issue, the shares allotted shall be up to a maximum of 5% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 30 September 2008.
The authority, which will terminate on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or 28 April 2010, whichever is earlier, gives the Directors flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities which may arise and the 5% limit ensures that existing shareholder interests are protected.
This resolution will be proposed as a special resolution.
Resolution 12 Purchase of own shares This resolution enables the Company to purchase up to 84,722,900 of its ordinary shares, being 5% of the issued share capital as at 30 September 2008 in the market, either for cancellation, or to hold as treasury shares.
The total number of outstanding options 110 Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 Notice of annual general meeting continued to subscribe for equity shares in the Company at 30 September 2008 is 84,669,225 which represents 5.0% of issued share capital of the Company excluding treasury shares.
If the authority to buy back shares is fully exercised, these would represent 5.3% of issued share capital of the Company excluding treasury shares.
The Directors would only use this authority after careful consideration, taking into account market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the overall position of the Company.
The Directors would only purchase such shares after taking into account the effects on earnings per share and the benefits for shareholders.
RECOMMENDATION Your Directors believe that all the proposals to be considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.
They recommend that you vote in favour of the proposed resolutions.
The Directors intend to vote their own shareholdings in the Company in favour of the proposed resolutions.
