Thomson Reuters uses free cash ow as a performance measure because it represents cash available to repay debt, pay dividends and fund new acquisitions.
In 2008, free cash ow was affected by certain unusual items.
The following analysis removes these items to derive our underlying free cash ow: Year ended December 31 2008 Free cash ow 1,817 One-time Reuters acquisition, integration and synergy costs 518 a Underlying free cash ow 2,335 b Adjustments for certain items 450 1,885 a Underlying free cash ow is free cash ow excluding one-time cash costs related to the Reuters acquisition and costs associated with integration and synergy programs.
b To provide a more normalized 2008 underlying free cash ow number we adjust for two timing-related items: Interest costs which were substantially lower in 2008 since we benefited from having interest income and only a partial year of interest expense related to the Reuters acquisition debt.
The 2008 amount does not include what is traditionally negative free cash ow from the Reuters business in the first quarter of the year, which will be reected in 2009.
