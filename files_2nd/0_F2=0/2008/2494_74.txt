Annual Report 2008 British American Tobacco 119 Directors report and accounts Notes on the accounts continued 9 Intangible assets continued Impairment testing for intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill Goodwill of 11,391 million 2007: 7,942 million included in intangible assets in the balance sheet is mainly the result of the following acquisitions: Rothmans Group 4,974 million 2007: 4,067 million : Imperial Tobacco Canada 2,261 million 2007: 2,046 million : ETI Italy 1,591 million 2007: 1,212 million as well as the 2 acquisitions made during 2008 ST principally Scandinavia 1,200 million: and Tekel Turkey 619 million.
The principal allocations of goodwill in the Rothmans acquisition are to the cash-generating units of Europe and South Africa, with the remainder mainly relating to operations in the domestic and export market in the United Kingdom and operations in Asia-Pacific.
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to 15 2007: 13 individual cash-generating units 5 in Europe 2007: 4, 2 in Africa and Middle East 2007: 1, 3 in Asia-Pacific 2007: 3, 3 in Latin America 2007: 3 and 2 in America-Pacific 2007: 2.
The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units of South Africa 833 million 2007: 814 million, Australia includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 650 million 2007: 591 million, Malaysia 474 million 2007: 358 million, Singapore 516 million 2007: 373 million, Europe includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 2,293 million 2007: 1,697 million, Canada 2,261 million 2007: 2,046 million, Italy 1,600 million 2007: 1,218 million and in respect of the acquisitions made during 2008, ST principally Scandinavia 1,200 million and Turkey 619 million are considered significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
The recoverable amount of all cash-generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis.
The key assumptions for the recoverable amount of all units are the long-term growth rate and the discount rate.
The long-term growth rate is a nominal rate used purely for the impairment testing of goodwill under IAS36 Impairment of Assets and does not reflect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.
The discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which specific market-related premium adjustments are made.
These assumptions have been applied to the individual cash flows of each unit as compiled by local management in the different markets.
The valuation uses cash flow projections based on detailed financial budgets approved by management covering a 2 year period, with cash flow beyond 2 years extrapolated by a nominal growth rate of 3 per cent per annum for the years 3 to 10, whereafter a zero per cent growth rate has been assumed.
The growth rate of 3 per cent per annum is considered a conservative rate given the Groups history of growth, its well balanced portfolio of brands and the industry in which it operates.
This longterm growth rate used does not exceed the expected long-term average growth rate for the markets in which the cashgenerating units operate.
In some instances, such as recent acquisitions or start-up ventures, the valuation is expanded to reflect the medium-term plan of management, spanning 5 years or beyond, with the cash flow beyond these years to year 10, extrapolated by the growth rate of 3 per cent, as above.
Pre-tax discount rates of between 7.9 per cent and 18.7 per cent 2007: 7.9 per cent to 18.7 per cent were used, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, together with any premium applicable for country area inflation and economical and political risks.
The pre-tax discount rates used for the cash-generating units which are significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill are 11.5 per cent for South Africa 2007: 12.1 per cent, 9.3 per cent for Europe 2007: 9.3 per cent, 9.7 per cent for Canada 2007: 10.0 per cent, 9.8 per cent for Italy 2007: 10.7 per cent, 8.7 per cent for ST principally Scandinavia and 13.1 per cent for Turkey.
Aside from the amounts written off in 2007 and shown as part of restructuring costs note 3 e, no impairment charges were recognised in 2008 or 2007.
If discounted cash flows per cash-generating unit should fall by 10 per cent, or the discount rate was increased at an after tax rate of 1 per cent, there would be no impairment.
