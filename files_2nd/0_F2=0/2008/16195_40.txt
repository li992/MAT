Intangible exploration and evaluation assets 2008 2007 000 000 At 1 January 956,580 820,437 Acquisition of subsidiaries note 26 48,959 351,783 193,872 Additions 40,149 Disposals Transfer to assets held for sale note 18 11,398 226,701 Amounts written off 64,235 368 Transfer from to property, plant and equipment note 10 15,442 375,896 Currency translation adjustments 15,613 At 31 December 1,417,777 956,580 The amounts for intangible exploration and evaluation assets represent active exploration projects.
These amounts will be written off to the Income Statement as exploration costs unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
Amounts written off include an impairment charge calculated in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets of 60.1 million 2007: nil.
This impairment has resulted from lower reserves estimates following a change in the most likely development plans and lower assumed oil prices following the fall in oil prices in the second half of the year.
In calculating this impairment, management has used a range of assumptions, including a long-term oil price of $80 per barrel and a 15% pre-tax discount rate.
