Overview Operating and financial review Our business Governance Financial statements and other information 93 Combined financial statements Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2008 1 Segment analysis Reed Elsevier is a publisher and information provider organised as four business segments: Elsevier, comprising scientific, technical and medical publishing: LexisNexis, providing legal, tax, regulatory, risk, information and analytics, and business information solutions to professional, business and government customers: Reed Exhibitions, organising trade exhibitions and conferences: and Reed Business Information RBI, providing information and marketing solutions to business professionals.
Internal reporting is consistent with this organisational structure.
On 21 February 2008 Reed Elsevier announced the intention to divest RBI which was accordingly then classified as a discontinued operation in the 2008 interim results.
On 10 December 2008 Reed Elsevier announced the termination of discussions to sell RBI as it was judged not possible to structure a transaction on acceptable terms at that time.
RBI has therefore now been presented as a continuing operation.
RBI and Reed Exhibitions, previously presented together as the Reed Business segment, are now managed as separate divisions and are presented as separate business segments.
Comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Adjusted operating profit figures are presented as additional performance measures.
They are stated before amortisation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill impairment, exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs, and are grossed up to exclude the equity share of taxes in joint ventures.
Exceptional restructuring costs relate to the major restructuring programme announced in February 2008 and in RBI, which was to be divested and not part of the original programme.
Exceptional restructuring costs principally comprise severance, outsourcing migration and associated property costs.
Adjusted operating profit is reconciled to operating profit in note 11.
Share of post-tax results of joint ventures of 18m 2007: 16m included in operating profit comprises 4m 2007: 3m relating to LexisNexis and 14m 2007: 13m relating to Reed Exhibitions.

6 Pension schemes A number of pension schemes are operated around the world.
The major schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The largest schemes, which cover the majority of employees, are in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.
Under these plans, employees are entitled to retirement benefits dependent on the number of years service provided.
The principal assumptions for the purpose of valuation under IAS19 Employee Benefits, are determined for each scheme in conjunction with the respective schemes independent actuaries and are presented below as the weighted average of the various defined benefit pension schemes.
The defined benefit pension expense for each year is based on the assumptions and scheme valuations set at 31 December of the prior year.
As at 31 December 2008 2007 2006 Discount rate 6.2% 5.9% 5.3% Expected rate of return on scheme assets 7.1% 7.1% 7.0% Expected rate of salary increases 3.7% 4.4% 4.2% Inflation 2.7% 3.1% 2.9% Future pension increases 2.8% 3.2% 2.9% The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant market indices and market expectations of real rates of return.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets is based on the weighted average of each asset category.
Mortality assumptions used in assessing defined benefit obligations make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable mortality statistics and the actuaries expectations for each scheme.
The average life expectancies assumed in the valuation of the defined benefit obligations are set out below.

Sensitivity analysis Valuation of Reed Elseviers pension scheme liabilities involves judgements about uncertain events, including the life expectancy of the members, salary and pension increases, inflation and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Estimates are used for each of these factors, determined in conjunction with independent actuaries.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
In particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, inflation and life expectancies would have the following approximate effects on the annual net pension expense and the defined benefit pension obligations: m Increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate: Decrease increase in annual net pension expense 6 Decrease increase in defined benefit pension obligations 132 Increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy: Increase decrease in annual net pension expense 6 Increase decrease in defined benefit pension obligations 90 Increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected inflation rate: Increase decrease in annual net pension expense 5 Increase decrease in defined benefit pension obligations 121 Additionally, the annual net pension expense includes an expected return on scheme assets.
A 5% increase decrease in the market value of equity investments held by the defined benefit pension schemes would, absent any change in their expected long term rate of return, increase decrease the amount of the expected return on scheme assets by 6m and would increase decrease the amount of the net pension surplus by 70m.

11 Adjusted figures Reed Elsevier uses adjusted figures as additional performance measures.
Adjusted figures are stated before amortisation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill impairment, exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs, disposals and other non operating items, related tax effects and movements in deferred taxation assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in the near term.
Adjusted operating profit is also grossed up to exclude the equity share of taxes in joint ventures.
Exceptional restructuring costs relate to the major restructuring programme announced in February 2008 and in RBI not included in the February 2008 announcement as the business was to be divested.
Acquisition related costs relate to acquisition integration and fees incurred in connection with acquisition financing.
Adjusted operating cash flow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures but before payments in relation to exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs.

108 Combined financial statements Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2008 13 Acquisitions On 19 September 2008 Reed Elsevier acquired the entire share capital of ChoicePoint, Inc. for a total consideration of 1,931m, after taking account of net cash acquired of 46m.
A number of other acquisitions, none of which were individually significant, were made for a total consideration of 200m, after taking account of net cash acquired of 5m.
The net assets of the businesses acquired are incorporated at their fair value to the combined businesses.
Provisional fair values of the consideration given and the assets and liabilities acquired are summarised below.

In addition, goodwill arises on the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions.
ii The provisional fair value of intangible assets acquired with ChoicePoint have been established with advice from independent qualified valuers.
iii Consideration for ChoicePoint comprises 1,955m to acquire the entire share capital and 22m of professional fees and other costs relating to the acquisition.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are provisional pending the completion of the valuation exercises.
Final fair values will be incorporated in the 2009 combined financial statements.
The businesses acquired in 2008 contributed 180m to revenue, 41m to adjusted operating profit, increased adjusted profit attributable by 21m, decreased profit attributable by 10m and contributed 42m to net cash inflow from operating activities for the part year under Reed Elsevier ownership and before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
Had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a proforma basis the Reed Elsevier revenues, adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit attributable and profit attributable for the year would have been 5,718m, 1,462m, 974m and 477m respectively before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
Overview Operating and financial review Our business Governance Financial statements and other information 109 Combined financial statements Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2008 14 Equity dividends On 18 January 2008, Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV paid special distributions of 82.0p and u1.767 per ordinary share respectively, from the net proceeds of the disposal of Harcourt Education.
The aggregate distribution of 2,013m including 27m paid to the employee benefit trust was recognised when paid.
The special distributions were accompanied by consolidations of the ordinary share capitals of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV on the basis of 58 new ordinary shares for every 67 existing ordinary shares, reflecting the ratio of the aggregate special distribution to the combined market capitalisation of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV excluding the 5.8% indirect equity interest in Reed Elsevier NV held by Reed Elsevier PLC as at 12 December 2007, the date of the announcement of the special distribution.

The directors of Reed Elsevier PLC have proposed a final dividend of 15.0p 2007: 13.6p.
The directors of Reed Elsevier NV have proposed a final dividend of u0.290 2007: u0.311.
The total cost of funding the proposed final dividends is expected to be 322m, for which no liability has been recognised at the balance sheet date.

Impairment charges principally relate to the Spanish residential property shows business within Reed Exhibitions Continental Europe which has seen a significant contraction of revenues since acquisition.
Impairment review Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is performed at least annually based on cash generating units CGUs.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets.
CGUs which are not individually significant have been aggregated for presentation purposes.
Typically, when an acquisition is made the acquired business is fully integrated into the relevant business unit and CGU, and the goodwill arising is allocated to the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
LexisNexis Risk has been separated out from LexisNexis US as a separate CGU in 2008 following the acquisition of ChoicePoint and its integration into the existing Risk business, with comparative information restated.
110 Combined financial statements Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2008 15 Goodwill continued The carrying value of goodwill recorded in the major groups of cash generating units is set out below.

Value in use is calculated based on estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value.
Estimated future cash flows are determined by reference to latest budgets and forecasts for the next five years approved by management, after which a long-term perpetuity growth rate is applied.
The estimates of future cash flows are consistent with past experience adjusted for managements estimates of future performance.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are discount rates and perpetuity growth rates.
The discount rates used are based on the Reed Elsevier weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect a risk premium specific to each CGU.
The Reed Elsevier weighted average cost of capital reflects an assumed equity return, based on the risk free rate for government bonds adjusted for an equity risk premium, and the Reed Elsevier post tax cost of debt.
The pre-tax discount rates applied are 9.5% for Elsevier, 10.0-10.5% for LexisNexis, 10.5-11.0% for Reed Exhibitions and 10.5-11.0% for Reed Business Information.
Cash flows subsequent to the forecast period of five years are assumed to grow at a nominal perpetuity growth rate.
The rates assumed are based on the long-term historic growth rates of the territories where the CGUs operate and the growth prospects for the sectors in which the CGUs operate.
A nominal perpetuity growth rate of 3% is used for all CGUs.
The value in use calculations and impairment reviews are sensitive to changes in key assumptions, particularly relating to discount rates and cash flow growth.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management: an increase in discount rate of 0.5%: a decrease in the compound annual growth rate CAGR for adjusted operating cash flow in the five year forecast period of between 2.0% and 5.0%, depending on the CGU: and a decrease in perpetuity growth rates of 0.5%.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairments would result under each of the sensitivity scenarios other than in the case of a 5.0% decline in adjusted operating cash flow CAGR over the five year forecast period which, if applied across all CGUs, would result in an impairment of 24m, or 35m if perpetuity growth rates were coincidentally reduced by 0.5%.

Overview Operating and financial review Our business Governance Financial statements and other information 115 Combined financial statements Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2008 19 Financial instruments continued The carrying amount of derivative financial liabilities comprises 240m 2007: 18m in relation to cash flow hedges and 18m 2007: 4m held for trading.
The carrying amount of derivative financial assets comprises 41m 2007: 170m in relation to fair value hedges, 8m 2007: 28m in relation to cash flow hedges and 27m 2007: 12m held for trading.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities held for trading comprise interest rate derivatives and forward foreign exchange contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments.
At 31 December 2008, Reed Elsevier had access to 2,074m 2007: 1,502m of committed bank facilities that expire in one to two years 2007: two to three years, of which 26m 2007: 42m was drawn.
These facilities principally provide back up for short term borrowings.
In February 2009, these facilities were reduced to 1,728m and, at the same time, new 1,382m committed bank facilities, forward starting in May 2010 and maturing in May 2012, were put in place.
At 31 December 2008, Reed Elsevier had fully drawn down a 2,908m 2007: nil committed loan facility established to finance the acquisition of ChoicePoint, Inc. After taking account of the maturity of committed bank facilities that back short term borrowings at 31 December 2008, and after utilising available cash resources, no borrowings mature in the next twelve months 2007: nil, 31% of borrowings mature in the second year 2007: nil, 33% of borrowings mature in the third year 2007: 27%, 12% in the fourth and fifth years 2007: 29%, 16% in the sixth to tenth years 2007: 31%, and 8% beyond the tenth year 2007: 13%.
Allowing for the 1,086m of term debt issued in January 2009 and the $2,000m 1,382m forward start facility, no borrowings mature in the next two years, 21% of borrowings mature in the third year, 36% in the fourth and fifth years, 23% in the sixth to tenth years, and 20% beyond the tenth year.
Market risk Reed Elseviers primary market risks are to interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by Reed Elsevier for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations and taxation is excluded from the following market risk sensitivity analysis.
Interest rate risk Reed Elseviers interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the combined businesses to changes in interest rates.
At 31 December 2008, 56% of net borrowings are either fixed rate or have been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net finance costs of 25m 2007: 7m, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2008.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net finance costs of 25m 2007: 7m.
After taking additional account of $1.6bn of term debt issued in January 2009, 74% of net borrowings are either fixed rate or have been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options, and a 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net finance costs of 15m.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net finance costs of 15m.
The impact on net equity of a theoretical change in interest rates as at 31 December 2008 is restricted to the change in carrying value of floating rate to fixed rate interest rate derivatives in a designated cash flow hedge relationship and undesignated interest rate derivatives.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated reduction in net equity of 39m 2007: 10m and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase net equity by an estimated 38m 2007: 10m.
The impact of a change in interest rates on the carrying value of fixed rate borrowings in a designated fair value hedge relationship would be offset by the change in carrying value of the related interest rate derivative.
Fixed rate borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are carried at amortised cost.
Foreign exchange rate risk Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in countries with currencies other than sterling, most particularly in respect of the US businesses.
These exposures are hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars see note 25.
A theoretical weakening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2008 would decrease the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 551m 2007: 262m.
This would be offset to a large degree by a decrease in net borrowings of 495m 2007: 123m.
A strengthening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2008 would increase the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 685m 2007: 328m and increase net borrowings by 605m 2007: 150m.
116 Combined financial statements Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2008 19 Financial instruments continued A retranslation of the combined businesses net profit for the year assuming a 10% weakening of all foreign currencies against sterling but excluding transactional exposures would reduce net profit by 38m 2007: 106m.
A 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies against sterling on this basis would increase net profit for the year by 46m 2007: 130m.
Credit risk Reed Elsevier seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
Reed Elsevier also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them.
Reed Elsevier has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than A by Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch.
Reed Elsevier also has credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers that include national and state governments, academic institutions and large and small enterprises including law firms, book stores and wholesalers.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Where appropriate, business units seek to minimise this exposure by taking payment in advance and through management of credit terms.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the balance sheet.
Included within trade receivables are the following amounts which are past due but for which no allowance has been made.
Past due up to one month 284m 2007: 234m : past due two to three months 123m 2007: 78m : past due four to six months 35m 2007: 26m : and past due greater than six months 11m 2007: 21m.
Examples of trade receivables which are past due but for which no allowance has been made include those receivables where there is no concern over the credit worthiness of the customer and where the history of dealings with the customer indicate the amount will be settled.
Hedge accounting The hedging relationships that are designated under IAS39 Financial Instruments are described below: Fair value hedges Reed Elsevier has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings due to interest rate and foreign currency movements which could affect the income statement.
Interest rate derivatives including cross currency interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 300m were in place at 31 December 2008 swapping fixed rate term debt issues denominated in Swiss francs CHF to floating rate USD debt for the whole of their term 2007: 820m swapping fixed rate term debt issues denominated in US dollars USD, euros and Swiss francs to floating rate USD debt for the whole or part of their term.

A fair value loss of nil 2007: 2m has been included within finance costs.
Gross borrowings as at 31 December 2008 included 78m 2007: nil in relation to fair value adjustments to borrowings previously designated in a fair value hedge relationship which were fide-designated during the year.
The related derivatives were closed out on fide-designation with a cash inflow of 62m 80m translated at 31 December 2008 exchange rates.
During 2008, 2m 2007: nil of these fair value adjustments were amortised as a reduction to finance costs.
Cash flow hedges Reed Elsevier enters into two types of cash flow hedge: 1 Interest rate derivatives which fix the interest expense on a portion of forecast floating rate denominated debt including commercial paper, short term bank loans and floating rate term debt.
2 Foreign exchange derivatives which fix the exchange rate on a portion of future foreign currency subscription revenues forecast by the Elsevier science and medical businesses for up to 50 months.
Movements in the hedge reserve pre-tax in 2008 and 2007, including gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments, were as follows: Foreign Total hedge Transition Interest rate exchange reserve loss hedges hedges pre-tax m m m m Hedge reserve at 1 January 2007: losses gains deferred 2 4 50 52 Losses gains arising in 2007 11 14 3 Amounts recognised in income statement 2 1 30 29 Exchange translation differences 2 2 Hedge reserve at 1 January 2008: losses gains deferred 8 36 28 Losses arising in 2008 60 183 243 Amounts recognised in income statement 6 25 19 Exchange translation differences 18 4 22 Hedge reserve at 31 December 2008: losses deferred 80 176 256 All cash flow hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2008.
A tax credit of 61m 2007: 8m charge in respect of the above gains and losses at 31 December 2008 was also deferred in the hedge reserve.
