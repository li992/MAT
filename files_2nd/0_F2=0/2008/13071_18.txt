The Committee considers the business principally from a geographical perspective, but with the Pharmaceuticals business RBP being managed separately given the significantly different nature of the business and the different risks and rewards associated with it.
The geographical segments, being Europe, NAA and Developing Markets, derive their revenue primarily from the manufacture and sale of branded products in household cleaning and health & personal care, whilst RBP derives its revenue exclusively from the sales of buprenorphine-based prescription drugs used to treat opiate dependence.
The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on net revenue and adjusted operating profit.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of exceptional items.
Inter-segment revenues are charged according to internally agreed pricing terms that are designed to be equivalent to an arms length basis, and have been consistently applied throughout 2007 and 2008.
The net revenue from external customers reported to the Executive Committee is measured in a manner consistent with that in the income statement.
2007 comparatives have been restated to disclose RBP separately, previously reported within Europe and NAA.
Reportable Segments The segment information provided to the Executive Committee for the reportable segments for the year ended 31 December 2008 is as follows: Developing Europe NAA Markets RBP Elimination Total 2008 m m m m m m Total gross segment net revenues 3,350 1,766 1,192 341 86 6,563 Inter-segment revenues 81 5 86 Net revenues 3,269 1,766 1,187 341 6,563 Depreciation and amortisation 65 22 14 7 108 Operating profit 782 367 163 193 1,505 Exceptional items 30 30 Operating profit adjusted 782 397 163 193 1,535 Developing Europe NAA Markets RBP Elimination Total 2007 Restated m m m m m m Total gross segment net revenues 2,844 1,325 975 211 86 5,269 Inter-segment revenues 79 7 86 Net revenues 2,765 1,325 968 211 5,269 Depreciation and amortisation 55 19 12 7 93 Operating profit 726 285 104 118 1,233 Exceptional items 69 26 43 Operating profit adjusted 657 285 130 118 1,190 Adjusted to exclude the impact of exceptional items.
The profits arising on inter-segment sales are insignificant.
There are no reconciling items between net revenues and operating profit shown above and those shown in the income statement.
The split of assets and liabilities by segment provided to the Executive Committee is as follows: Developing Europe NAA Markets RBP Total 2008 m m m m m Inventories 294 148 122 35 599 Trade and other receivables 507 191 207 44 949 Total segment assets 801 339 329 79 1,548 Trade and other payables 1,153 419 363 87 2,022 Developing Europe NAA Markets RBP Total 2007 Restated m m m m m Inventories 211 96 82 19 408 Trade and other receivables 394 118 161 24 697 Total segement assets 605 214 243 43 1,105 Trade and other payables 892 290 267 34 1,483 44 Reckitt Benckiser 2008 2 OPERATING SEGMENTS CONTINUED The assets and liabilities are allocated based upon the operations of the segment and the physical location of the asset or liability.
There are a number of unallocated assets and liabilities that comprise corporate items that are not specifically attributable to one segment.
Reconciliation of these assets and liabilities to total assets or liabilities in the balance sheet is shown below: Restated 2008 2007 m m Inventories for reportable segments 599 408 Unallocated: Elimination of profit on inter-company inventory 43 26 Total inventories per the balance sheet 556 382 Trade and other receivables for reportable segments 949 697 Unallocated: Corporate items 43 15 Total trade and other receivables per the balance sheet 906 682 Total inventories and trade and other receivables per the balance sheet 1,462 1,064 Other unallocated assets 7,720 4,804 Total assets per the balance sheet 9,182 5,868 Trade and other payables for reportable segments 2,022 1,483 Unallocated: Corporate items 167 152 Total trade and other payables per the balance sheet 2,189 1,635 Other unallocated liabilities 3,699 1,848 Total liabilities per the balance sheet 5,888 3,483 Unallocated assets include goodwill and intangible assets, property plant and equipment and cash and cash equivalents, while unallocated liabilities include borrowings and deferred tax liabilities.
Analysis of product groups The Group analyses its revenue by the following product groups: Fabric Care, Surface Care, Dishwashing, Home Care, Health & Personal Care, making up core business, together with Other Household, Pharmaceuticals and Food.
Net revenues 2008 2007 m m Fabric Care 1,473 1,241 Surface Care 1,112 951 Dishwashing 754 616 Home Care 908 779 Health & Personal Care 1,682 1,199 Core Business 5,929 4,786 Other Household 67 81 Household, Health & Personal Care 5,996 4,867 Pharmaceuticals 341 211 Food 226 191 Total 6,563 5,269 Certain minor brands previously disclosed in the Other Household category have been reclassified across the core categories.
The comparatives have not been reclassified as the amounts involved are not significant.
The majority of the categories above are split across the three geographical segments being Europe, NAA and Developing Markets.
The notable exceptions to this are: Food, which is sold exclusively in NAA and Pharmaceuticals which is within its own reportable segment.
Reckitt Benckiser 2008 45 Notes to the accounts continued 2 OPERATING SEGMENTS CONTINUED The entity is domiciled in the UK.

The other receivables of 2m are included, along with the post-employment benefit asset of 28m within the other receivables of 30m in the balance sheet.
Major customers are typically large grocery chains, mass market and multiple retailers.
The Companys customer base is diverse with no single external customer accounting for more than 10% of net revenues, and the top ten customers only accounting for between a quarter and a third of total net revenues.

c Share based remuneration All share awards that were not fully vested as at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 are included in the tables below which analyse the charge for 2008 and 2007.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the award.
Reckitt Benckiser 2008 49 Notes to the accounts continued 5 EMPLOYEES CONTINUED Notes Scope: Executive Share Awards are awarded to the Top 400 Management Group.
Other Share Awards represent SAYE Schemes offered to all staff within the relevant geographic area and a number of Senior Executive Share Ownership Policy Plan SOPP awards.
Individual tranches of these awards are not material for detailed disclosure and therefore have been aggregated in the table above.
Contractual Life: Executive Share Awards have a contractual life of ten years but vest according to EPS growth criteria over a three-year period.
Accordingly, the cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
Other share awards have contractual lives of either three, five or seven years.
Performance criteria: Executive Share Awards are subject to performance criteria based on compound average annual growth CAAG rates in earnings per share over the performance period.
Other Share Awards are generally not subject to any criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Executive Share Awards included in the above table vest as follows: CAAG of 6%: 40% of awards vest: 7% CAAG: 60%: 8% CAAG: 80%: 9% CAAG: 100%.
The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the Plans, early exercise is not permitted and therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also assumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to the Plans in 2007 or 2008 for the purposes of the valuation.
Volatility: An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
Income statement charge: the income statement charge may not exactly equal one third of the total fair value included in the table above due to adjustments for in-year lapses or award revisions.
National Insurance contributions are payable in respect of certain share based payments transactions and are treated as cash-settled transactions.
At 31 December 2008, the carrying amount of National Insurance contributions payable was 17m 2007 19m of which 8m 2007 14m was in respect of vested grants.
Any additional terms of these shares are shown in the Directors Remuneration report on pages 30 to 35.
The weighted average share price for the year was 27.15 2007 27.06. d Pension and other post-retirement commitments The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees, which are principally funded.
The Groups two most significant defined benefit pension schemes UK and US are both funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The Group also operates a number of other post-retirement schemes in certain countries.
The major scheme is in the US US retiree health care scheme, where salaried participants become eligible for retiree health care benefits after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered figure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
As at 31 December 2008 there were 2,655 2007 2,738 eligible retirees and 1,682 2007 1,415 current employees potentially eligible.
Pension costs for the year are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Defined contribution schemes 19 17 Defined benefit schemes net charge 15 11 Total pension costs recognised in the income statement note 3 34 28 For the UK scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2007 and updated at 31 December 2008.
For the US scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 January 2007 and updated at 31 December 2008.
The projected unit valuation method was used for the UK and US scheme valuations.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries for the three major schemes as at 31 December 2008 were: 2008 2007 US US US US UK pension medical UK pension medical % % % % % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.6 4.5 5.3 5.0 Rate of increase in deferred pensions during deferment 2.6 3.3 Rate of increase in pension payments pensioners 2.8 3.3 Rate of increase in pension payments non-pensioners 2.6 3.3 Discount rate 6.5 5.7 5.7 5.8 6.0 6.0 Inflation assumption 2.6 3.0 3.3 3.0 Annual medical cost inflation 5.0-9.0 5.0-9.0 Long-term expected rate of return on: Equities 7.7 9.5 7.9 10.1 Bonds 4.7 5.7 5.1 4.8 Other 5.8 6.7 6.2 50 Reckitt Benckiser 2008 5 EMPLOYEES CONTINUED The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with published statistics and experience in each territory.
For the UK scheme the mortality assumptions were based on the following tables.
The average remaining life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at aged 60 on the balance sheet date is as follows: 2008 2007 Male 25.6 25.5 Female 28.0 27.9 The average remaining life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at aged 60, 20 years after the balance sheet date is as follows: 2008 2007 Male 26.9 26.8 Female 29.1 29.1 For the US scheme the mortality assumptions were determined using the RP2000 combined table.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 60 on the balance sheet date is 22.4 years 2007 22.4 years for males and 24.7 years 2007 24.7 years for females.
Impact of medical cost trends rates A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: 1% -1% m m Effect on service cost and interest cost 1 1 Effect on post-retirement benefit obligation 17 14 The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2008 2007 US US US US UK pension medical Other Total UK pension medical Other Total m m m m m m m m m m Total equities 287 52 27 366 392 72 25 489 Total bonds 219 38 27 284 240 40 16 296 Total other assets 47 7 6 60 81 7 88 Fair value of plan assets 553 97 60 710 713 112 48 873 Present value of scheme liabilities 573 160 130 148 1,011 695 113 99 125 1,032 Net liability asset recognised in the balance sheet 20 63 130 88 301 18 1 99 77 159 Other represents the total of post-retirement benefits and Group defined benefit schemes not material for individual disclosure.

These assets will be recognised if utilisation of the losses and other temporary differences becomes reasonably certain.
The tax charge is expected to be impacted by items in the nature of those listed above for the foreseeable future.
Included within other permanent differences is the impact of tax law changes in the UK and tax rate changes in other jurisdictions of 6m charge 2007 24m credit.
8 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 2008 1,120m 2007 938m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period 2008 710,569,582 2007 715,039,130.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Executive Options and Employee Sharesave schemes.
The options only dilute earnings when they result in the issue of shares at a value below the market price of the share and when all performance criteria if applicable have been met.
As at 31 December 2008, there were 4.7m 2007 4.5m of Executive Options not included within the dilution because the contingent performance targets had not been met.
The reconciliation between profit for the year and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of the diluted earnings per share is set out below: 2008 2007 Profit for Average Earnings Profit for Average Earnings the year number of per share the year number of per share m shares pence m shares pence Profit attributable to shareholders 1,120 710,569,582 157.6 938 715,039,130 131.2 Dilution for Executive Options outstanding and Executive Restricted Share Plan 12,491,457 17,345,740 Dilution for Employee Sharesave scheme options outstanding 1,047,123 1,240,227 On a diluted basis 1,120 724,108,162 154.7 938 733,625,097 127.9 54 Reckitt Benckiser 2008 8 EARNINGS PER SHARE CONTINUED Adjusted basis The reconciliation between profit for the year and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculations of the diluted earnings per share is set out below: 2008 2007 Profit for Average Earnings Profit for Average Earnings the year number of per share the year number of per share m shares pence m shares pence Profit attributable to shareholders 1,143 710,569,582 160.9 905 715,039,130 126.6 Dilution for Executive Options outstanding and Executive Restricted Share Plan 12,491,457 17,345,740 Dilution for Employee Sharesave scheme options outstanding 1,047,123 1,240,227 On a diluted basis 1,143 724,108,162 157.8 905 733,625,097 123.4 adjusted to exclude exceptional items.
The Directors believe that a diluted earnings per ordinary share, adjusted for the impact of the exceptional items after the appropriate tax amount, provides additional useful information on underlying trends to shareholders in respect of earnings per ordinary share.

The majority of brands, all of goodwill and certain other intangibles are considered to have indefinite lives for the reasons noted in the Accounting Policies and accordingly are subject to an annual impairment review.
A number of small non-core brands are deemed to have a finite life and are amortised accordingly.
The net book values of indefinite and finite life assets are as follows: 2008 2007 Net book value m m Indefinite life assets: Brands 4,651 2,908 Goodwill 1,712 830 Other 36 35 Total indefinite life assets 6,399 3,773 Finite life assets: Brands 8 9 Software 1 1 Other 46 28 Total finite life assets 55 38 Total net book value intangible assets 6,454 3,811 The annual impairment review for goodwill and other intangible assets is based on an assessment of each assets value in use.
Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections based on historical operating results, short-term budgets, medium-term business plans five years and longer-term extrapolation.
The long-term extrapolations assume a growth rate of no more than the long-term inflation assumption for the relevant markets range of 2%-4%.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12% 2007 12% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
A higher rate is used where appropriate to reflect specific risks associated with the relevant product group range of 11%17%.
Key assumptions which are kept under constant review by management in the impairment review include future sales volumes, growth rates and prices, and future levels of marketing support required to sustain, grow and further innovate brands.
No reasonably possible change to a key assumption would cause any product groups recoverable amount to be less than its carrying value.
An analysis of the net book value of brands by product group, which the Group considers cash generating units, is shown below: 2008 2007 Product group Key brands m m Fabric Care Calgon, Vanish, Woolite 647 501 Surface Care Dettol, Lysol 745 562 Dishwashing Calgonit, Finish 209 160 Home Care Air Wick 220 173 Health & Personal Care Veet, Nurofen, Strepsils, Clearasil, Mucinex 2,802 1,494 Food Frenchs 36 27 Brands total 4,659 2,917 The impairment charge for the year ended 31 December 2008 is nil 2007 27m.

Of the Groups total value of goodwill of 1,712m 2007: 830m, 1,666m 2007: 799m relates to the Health & Personal Care product group.
No other product group contains a significant goodwill balance.
During 2008 nil 2007 nil of development expenditure has been assessed as meeting the requirements of IAS 38 and so has been capitalised within other intangible assets.

The credit risk of customers is assessed at a subsidiary and Group level, taking into account their financial positions, past experiences and other relevant factors.
Individual customer credit limits are imposed based on these factors.
As of 31 December 2008, trade receivables of 51m 2007 40m were past due but not impaired.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables past due but not impaired is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Up to 3 months 51 40 The carrying amount of the Groups trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies: 2008 2007 m m Sterling 20 51 Euro 352 260 US dollar 186 113 Other currencies 348 258 906 682 As at 31 December 2008, trade receivables of 20m 2007 15m were considered to be impaired.
The amount of provision of 31 December 2008 was 13m 2007 11m.
It was assessed that a portion of the receivables is expected to be recovered due to the nature and historical collection of trade receivables.
The ageing analysis of these receivables is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Up to 3 months 14 10 Over 3 months 6 5 20 15 The movement in the provision for impaired receivables consists of increases for additional provisions offset by receivables written off and unused provision released back to the income statement.
The gross movements in the provision are considered to be insignificant.
The other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
They consist of items including reclaimable turnover tax and other tax receivables, and are from a broad selection of countries within the Group.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the year end is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
58 Reckitt Benckiser 2008 14 AVAILABLE FOR SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Current These investments do not meet the requirements to be classified as cash equivalents due to having maturities of greater than three months.
They are, however, highly liquid assets, consisting solely of short-term deposits.
All of these deposits are held with financial institutions with a BBB rating or above.
The effective interest rate on these short-term deposits is 10.46% 2007 8.0% and they have an average maturity of 438 days 2007 256 days from inception.
Non-current These investments are auction rate securities issued by US state authorities denominated in US dollars with redemption dates falling beyond 2009.
They are typically traded on a secondary market, however due to the current inactivity of this market there is uncertainty over whether they are likely to be redeemed within one year and therefore have been classified as non-current.
The market for auction rate securities is inactive and therefore management has adopted a discounted cashflow valuation technique to determine a fair value of the securities at 31 December 2008.
The movement in the fair value of auction rate securities is detailed below: 2008 2007 m m At 1 January Acquisition fair value 35 Disposals 17 Fair value adjustments transferred to equity note 22 8 Exchange adjustments 15 At 31 December 25 15 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 2008 2007 m m Cash at bank and in hand 213 130 Short-term bank deposits 204 198 Cash and cash equivalents 417 328 Due to foreign currency exchange restrictions 50m 2007 67m of cash included in cash and cash equivalents is restricted for use by the Group.

The current element of deferred tax is considered to be within short-term timing differences and tax losses.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future based on the current repatriation policy of the Group.

Reserves The original merger reserve arose in 1999 following the combination of Reckitt & Colman plc and Benckiser N. V. to form Reckitt Benckiser plc.
This transaction was accounted for as a merger.
During the year ended 31 December 2007 there was a debit of 14,371m to the merger reserve as a result of the Group reconstruction which was treated as a merger under Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985.
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedge transactions that are extant at year end.
The foreign currency translation reserve contains the accumulated foreign exchange differences from the translation of the financial statements of the Groups foreign operations arising when the Groups entities are consolidated.
The reserve also contains the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net exposure in a foreign currency.

2 The categories in this disclosure are determined by IAS 39.
Finance leases are outside the scope of IAS 39, but they remain within the scope of IFRS 7.
Therefore finance leases have been shown separately.
3 Only includes trade and other payables classified as financial liabilities.
In determining the fair value of the financial instruments, the Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques such as estimated discounted cash flows are used to determine fair value for the auction rate securities.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward rates at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value less impairment provision of investments, current borrowings, cash at bank, trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
Reckitt Benckiser 2008 65 Notes to the accounts continued 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Financial risk management The Groups multi-national operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity and interest rates.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, including debt and other instruments, to fix interest rates.
The Groups financing and financial risk management activities are centralised into the Group Treasury Centre GTC to achieve benefits of scale and control.
The GTC is not a profit centre, but adds value to the business operations by managing financial exposures of the Group centrally in a manner consistent with underlying business risks.
The GTC manages only those risks and flows generated by the underlying commercial operations and speculative transactions are not undertaken.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies, guidelines and authority levels for all areas of treasury activity and individually approves significant activities.
The GTC operates under close control of the Chief Financial Officer and is subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
Market risk a Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The Groups policy is to align interest costs and operating profit of its major currencies in order to provide some protection against the translation exposure on foreign currency profits after tax.
The Group may undertake borrowings and other hedging methods in the currencies of the countries where most of its assets are located.
It is the Groups policy to monitor and only where appropriate hedge its foreign currency transaction exposure.
These transaction exposures arise mainly from foreign currency receipts and payments for goods and services and from the remittances of foreign currency dividends and loans.
The local business units enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with the GTC to manage these exposures where practical and allowed by local regulations.
The GTC matches the Group exposures, and hedges the net position where possible, using spot and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2008 was 829m payable 2007 902m payable.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group had US dollar-denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of net investment in its subsidiaries in the USA.
The carrying value of the dollar borrowings at 31 December 2008 was 1,245m 2007 nil.
The foreign exchange loss of 378m 2007 gain of 2m on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges.
At 31 December 2008, if the US dollar had strengthened by 15% against sterling, with all other variables held constant, the foreign exchange loss recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve would have been 220m higher.
Cash flow hedge profile As at 31 December 2008, the Group had no material individual financial instruments classified as cash flow hedges.
The same was true as at 31 December 2007.
The Group held forward foreign exchange contracts denominated as cash flow hedges primarily in US dollars, Euros and Australian dollars.
Nominal value of the payable leg resulting from these financial instruments was as follows: 2008 2007 m m US dollar 70 45 Euro 55 11 Australian dollars 12 9 Other 21 16 158 81 These forward foreign exchange contracts are expected to mature evenly over the period January 2009 to March 2010 2007 January 2008 to March 2009.
The ineffective portion recognised in the profit or loss that arises from cash flow hedges amounts to nil 2007 nil.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity note 22 on forward exchange contracts as of 31 December 2008 are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is generally within 12 months from the balance sheet date unless the gain or loss is included in the initial recognition of a financial asset in which case recognition is over the lifetime of the asset.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.
66 Reckitt Benckiser 2008 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Forward foreign exchange contracts In the case of cash flow hedges, these are denominated in a diverse range of currencies, where a fluctuation in one individual currency relationship with all others held constant does not have a significant effect on the consolidated profit or loss or shareholders equity.
The largest fluctuation is in respect of a forward contract between the Canadian and US dollar when at 31 December 2008, if the Canadian dollar had strengthened weakened by 15% against the US dollar, with all other variables held constant, shareholders equity would have been 8m 2007 5%: 2m lower higher.
The remaining major non-derivative monetary financial instruments liquid assets, receivables, interest and non-interest bearing liabilities are directly denominated in the functional currency or are transferred to the functional currency through the use of derivatives.
As at 31 December 2008 if all other currencies had strengthened weakened by 15% against sterling with all other variables held constant, this would have had an insignificant effect on consolidated profit or loss or shareholders equity 2007 insignificant.
b Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk.
Due to the nature of its business the Group is exposed to commodity price risk related to the production or packaging of finished goods such as oil related and a diverse range of other raw materials.
This risk is, however, managed primarily through medium-term contracts with certain key suppliers and is not therefore viewed as being a material risk.
c Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Group has both interest-bearing and non interest-bearing liabilities.
The Group manages its interest expense rate exposure using a mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt.
The Group manages its interest rate exposure on its gross financial assets by using a combination of fixed rate term deposits.
Finance leases are exposed to fixed interest rates and all other financial assets and liabilities are exposed to floating interest rates.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on profit or loss of a defined interest rate shift.
For each simulation, the same interest rate shift is used for all currencies, calculated on a full year and pre tax basis.
The scenarios are only run for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
Based on the simulations performed, the impact on the profit or loss of a 100 basis-point shift in interest rates would be a maximum increase of 10m 2007 50 bps: 2m or decrease of 10m 2007 50 bps: 2m, respectively for the liabilities covered.
The simulation is done on a periodic basis to verify that the maximum loss potential is within the limit given by management.
2. Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers.
The credit quality of trade and other receivables is detailed in note 13.
Financial institution counterparties are subject to approval under the Groups counterparty risk policy and such approval is limited to financial institutions with a BBB rating or above.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit defined within the counterparty risk policy, which is reassessed annually by the Board.
Derivative financial instruments are only traded with counterparties approved in accordance with the Board policy.
Derivative risk is measured using a risk weighting method.
The table below summarises the Groups major financial institution counterparties by credit rating and balances cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits at the balance sheet date.
