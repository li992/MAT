During the year ended 31st December, 2008, the Group had two 2007: two share-based payment arrangements, which are described below: Company Share Option Plan CSOP The CSOP provides for grants of share options at an exercise price equal to the mid-market quoted market price for the Companys shares on the day before the date of grant.
Options can be exercised three years after grant.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Share Matching Plan SMP The SMP enables the individual to invest in the ordinary share capital of the Company.
The investment may be matched dependent upon the net asset value per share performance relative to the performance of the FTSE All-Share index over a three year period, up to a maximum of 3:1 matching shares on a net to gross basis.
CSOP SMP Number outstanding at 1st January, 2008 29,675 181,465 Granted 33,075 416,025 Lapsed 3,603 3,200 Exercised Outstanding at 31st December, 2008 59,147 594,290 Exercisable at 31st December, 2008 Number outstanding at 1st January, 2007 Granted 29,675 181,465 Lapsed Exercised Outstanding at 31st December, 2007 29,675 181,465 Exercisable at 31st December, 2007 For awards granted during the year, the weighted average share price was 20.50.
The weighted average fair values are 3.46 for the CSOP awards and 20.50 for the SMP awards.
The weighted average exercise price for options outstanding at 31st December, 2008 is 20.71 and the weighted average contractual life is nine and a half years.
The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: Share price: 20.50 for the CSOP and 20.50 for the SMP, being the share price at date of grant.
Exercise price: 20.50 for the CSOP awards and Nil for the SMP awards.
Expected volatility: 16.2% based on historic volatility over a period prior to grant equal to expected term.
Expected term: 6.5 years for the CSOP awards and 3 years for the SMP awards.
Expected dividends: 2.8%, based on historic dividend yield, zero for SMP as dividends vest to participants.
Equity-settled share-based payments amounted to a credit of 199,000 2007: a charge of 271,000.

The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
Contracts designated as fair value hedges are offset against movements in the underlying loans and borrowings in the income statement.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding derivative financial instrument contracts is as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Currency and interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges 86,200 86,200 Other currency and interest rate swaps 116,200 116,200 The Group does not trade in derivatives.
In general, derivatives are held to hedge specific exposures and have maturities designated to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them, until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement costs of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are included in the income statement.

In pursuing its investment objectives, the Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk, and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The directors approach to the management of these risks is set out below.
The Board oversees the Groups risk management, which is embedded in the operating committees in the business, in conjunction with senior management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks, that are set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period.
Note 25.1 Valuation market price risk The Groups exposure to valuation risk comprises mainly movements in the value of its underlying investments.
A breakdown of the Groups portfolio is given on page 44 and a detailed analysis of the 15 largest underlying investments is given on pages eight to ten.
All underlying investments are valued at fair value by the Directors in accordance with the Groups valuation policy set out on page 11.
It should be noted that at 31st December, 2008, 78% of the Groups underlying investments have been valued on the multiple of earnings basis.
Hence, future changes in comparable earnings multiples of publicly quoted companies which we use to value our unquoted holdings, and changes in the trading results of portfolio companies, will impact the valuations of the portfolio companies.
Market conditions for exits and the availability of well-priced debt finance all have an impact not only on the Groups valuation of its portfolio but also on the Groups ability to exit from its underlying portfolio and therefore on the management of the balance sheet and the levels of gearing of the Company.
Candover 53 Report and accounts 2008 Overview Business review Financial statements and notes Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31st December, 2008 continued The table below summarises the effect that any fluctuation in market multiples would have on the valuation of the Groups portfolio: Increase Decrease 000 000 Fixed asset investments at fair value through profit and loss at 31st December, 2008 310,049 310,049 20% changes in comparable multiples 130,080 132,413 Adjusted fair value of investments 440,129 177,636 Percentage of current fair value of investments 42% 43% Valuation market price sensitivity The Groups sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in the Groups levels of borrowing and liquidity.
Any reduction in the value of the portfolio will be amplified by our balance sheet gearing, which was 29% as at 31st December, 2008.
It will also be affected by leverage in the companies in which we invest and the local currency denomination of such investments which is considered separately under currency risk.
Management of the risk The Groups senior management assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
The Board monitors valuation risk by reviewing and approving the valuation of the portfolio.
Concentration risk The Group invests across a range of economic sectors and geographies.
Over-exposure to a particular sector or geography could increase the impact of adverse changes in macroeconomic or market conditions on the Group.
An increase in the average size of investments over time could also increase the exposure of the Group to the performance of a small number of large investments, albeit in different sectors and or geographies.
The portfolio is subject to periodic reviews by senior management in order to monitor exposure to any one sector or geography and to monitor the exposure to larger investments.
One of the conditions set out under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 is that no single investment can exceed 15% of the Groups investment portfolio to maintain the Groups tax status as an Investment Trust.
This also mitigates the Groups exposure to investment concentration risk.
Note 25.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with uncalled commitments and financial liabilities.
The Group invests from its own balance sheet using cash generated from its investing activities.
It is anticipated that over the longer term, and in normal circumstances, commitments would be financed by distributions received on the realisation of existing investments.
However, over the second half of 2008, the effects of the global economic crisis have meant not only a delay in expected realisations but a major decrease in net asset valuations caused primarily by continued falling public market comparable earnings multiples.
The Board has therefore reviewed the Groups financing strategy and announced that it is not currently in a position to make any further investment in the 2008 Fund.
Instead the Boards main priority is to ensure that it has the capital required to fund its commitment of 90.4 million for followon investments in the Candover 2005 Fund and to maintain headroom in the bond covenants.
The Groups outstanding co-investment commitments and financial liabilities at 31st December 2008 were as follows: Uncalled commitments Initial Outstanding Commitment Commitments 2008 2007 mm wm mm Candover 2008 Fund 1,000 873.0 - Candover 2005 Fund 490 93.5 236.7 Candover 2001 Fund 300 Nil 6.0 External funds N A 4.7 6.0 971.2 248.7 Further investment alongside the 2008 Fund has currently been suspended.
Candover 54 Report and accounts 2008 Financial liabilities The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31st December, 2008, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required was as follows: 2008 2007 3 months Not more More than 3 months Not more More than or less than 1 year 1 year Total or less than 1 year 1 year Total m m m m m m m m Group and Company Borrowings under the US Private Placement loan notes 198.1 198.1 122.5 122.5 Financial liabilities on equity commitments 16.8 10.1 35.1 62.0 Interest payable on US private placement loan 1.3 9.0 32.0 42.3 2.9 8.8 68.2 79.9 18.1 19.1 265.2 302.4 2.9 8.8 190.7 202.4 2005 Fund equity bridge obligations.
The terms of issue of the US Private Placement loan notes and multi-currency revolving facility require the Group to comply with a loan to value covenant.
Note 25.3 Currency risk Certain of the Groups assets, liabilities, income and expenses, are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Groups functional currency, and in which it reports its results, primarily with respect to the euro and the $ US dollar.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future investment transactions and recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk Senior management monitors the Groups exposure to foreign currencies, and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Senior management measures the risk to the Group of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Groups net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Groups assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings and derivative financial instruments are used to limit the Groups exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
These borrowings and contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
As the majority of the Groups future investment commitments are anticipated to be in m euro, US$175 million of the $ US dollar loan notes raised under the US Private Placement has been converted to m euro liabilities through use of derivative financial instruments designated as effective fair value hedges.
Likewise the 30 million of funding received in January 2008 has been swapped into a m euro liability.
To reduce the foreign exchange risk arising from future investment transactions, cash and cash equivalents are split by currency according to the anticipated long-term requirements.

It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US Dollar - 20% 2007: 5% Euro - 20% 2007: 5% The increase in percentage used this year is to reflect the current market conditions that differ significantly compared to the year end last year.
These percentages have been determined based on a reasonable estimate of the potential volatility.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
If sterling had weakened strengthened amounts negative of those shown against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2008 - 20% 2007 - 5% US $ Euro US $ Euro 000 000 000 000 Loss attributable to equity shareholders 20% 5% 8,029 18,000 470 13,207 Loss attributable to equity shareholders -20% -5% 12,044 26,999 519 14,597 Note 25.4 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities including unquoted loans the level of income receivable on cash and cash equivalents the fair value of the Companys loan notes issued under the US Private Placement linked to fair value movement and derivatives the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings the fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and funding decisions.
The majority of the financial investments that are interest bearing bear fixed interest: as a result, the Group is not subject to significant amounts of cash flow interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
Any excess cash and cash equivalents are invested at short-term market interest rates, further reducing such risks.
The loan notes raised through the US Private Placement were partly raised at fixed interest rates: these have substantially been swapped to floating rates set on a periodic basis at the prevailing market rate plus margin.
Interest rate exposure The exposure for the Group and Company, at 31st December, of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates i. e. giving cash flow interest rate risk when the interest rate is due to be re-set fixed interest rates i. e. giving fair value interest rate risk when the financial instrument is due for repayment.

The fixed rate exposures have mainly been swapped into floating rate exposures through the use of the derivative financial instruments, with a subsequent weighted average margin over EURIBOR of 1.40% to 1.44%.
Interest rate sensitivity As the Groups loan note investments are held at fair value through profit or loss and valued in conjunction with the equity investment in the portfolio company, the valuation policy to which is stated on page 11, these are not subject to changes in value arising from interest rate movements.
Candover 58 Report and accounts 2008 As cash and cash equivalents are invested at short-term market rates, for fixed short-term periods and held to maturity, they are not significantly impacted in respect of fair value by movements in interest rates.
As certain of the borrowings under the US Private Placement loan notes are held at amortised cost, the movement in interest rates does not impact upon their carrying value.
A 50 bps movement in interest rates would impact upon the combined valuation of the derivatives and related hedged US private placement loan notes by: 50bps, a decrease in profit of 961,000: and 50bps, an increase in profit of 980,000.
Note 25.5 Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk principally arises from its investment in short-dated listed fixed income securities, money market instruments and its cash deposits.
Management of the risk This risk is managed as follows: where an investment is made in an unquoted loan to a private equity investment, it is made as part of the overall equity and debt investment package, and the recoverability of the debt is assessed as part of the overall investment process transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Group of default exposure to individual financial institutions is minimised by the Group spreading its cash across a number of liquidity funds and banks cash equivalents consist of short-dated listed fixed income securities and money market instruments, with a credit rating of AAor above cash at bank is held only with major UK banks with high quality external credit ratings or government support.
