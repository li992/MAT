The amounts for these items are included in total EEV profit attributable to shareholders.
The directors believe that operating profit, as adjusted for these items, better reflects underlying performance.
Profit before tax and basic earnings per share include these items together with actual investment returns.
This basis of presentation has been adopted consistently throughout this supplementary information.
Restructuring costs comprise the charge of 28 million recognised on an IFRS basis and an additional 4 million recognised on the EEV basis for the shareholders share of costs incurred by the PAC with-profits fund.
The results for continuing operations shown above exclude those in respect of discontinued banking operations, which were sold on 1 May 2007.
In addition, there have been some minor adjustments to 2007 comparatives, as detailed in notes 4f, 5 and 20.
