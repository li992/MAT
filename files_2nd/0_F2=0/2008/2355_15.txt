Notes to the financial statements Bovis Homes Group PLC the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2008 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 6 March 2009.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS and its interpretations as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, available for sale assets and certain items of inventory which are stated at their fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of adopted IFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 31.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the Company and the Group where relevant.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
Accounting policies Business combinations The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the Group.
The cost of or consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given and liabilities taken on or assumed in return for the acquisition plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
On acquisition, identifiable assets and liabilities are measured initially at fair value, with any excess of consideration being recognised as goodwill.
Accounting policies of subsidiary undertakings have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with those adopted by the Group.
Revenue Revenue is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser.
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts.
Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties and land is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable on legal completion of the sale transaction.
Revenue does not include the value of the onward legal completion of properties accepted in part exchange against a new property.
The net gain or loss arising from the legal completion of these part exchange properties is recognised in cost of sales.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expenditure.

co. uk plc Notes to the financial statements continued Net financing costs Net finance costs comprise: interest payable on borrowings, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method: interest receivable on funds invested accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method: dividend income recognised on the date the right to receive payments is established: imputed interest on available-for-sale financial assets and on deferred terms land payables: pension finance costs or benefits being the net of interest costs on liabilities and expected return on assets linked to the Defined Benefit Scheme: and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Finance costs are included in the measurement of borrowings at their amortised cost to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Taxation Income tax comprises the sum of the tax currently payable or receivable and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable or receivable is based on taxable profit or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability or asset for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from non-tax deductible goodwill, from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, and from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts where deemed appropriate to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
Where the derivative instrument, typically an interest rate swap, is deemed an effective hedge over the exposure being hedged, the derivative instrument is treated as a cash flow hedge and hedge accounting applied.
Under a cash flow hedge, gains and losses on the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognised directly in equity.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting and any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in reserves is retained in reserves until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in reserves is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Goodwill Where the fair value of consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the excess is recognised as goodwill arising on consolidation and is capitalised as an asset.
Once capitalised, this asset is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis with any impairment arising requiring immediate recognition in the income statement.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the cash-generating units of the Group at acquisition.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then, where appropriate, to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain property that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, this being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Regular reviews of the carrying values of property are completed to assess any impairment in value.
When impairment is identified, the assets recoverable amount is assessed and any shortfall is written off through the income statement.
Bovis Homes Group PLC 45 Notes to the financial statements continued Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less residual value which is reassessed annually of assets over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation is charged on property in respect of the value of the building.
The basis of depreciation for each class of asset is as follows: Buildings straight line over 50 years Plant and machinery 33.3% reducing balance Computer equipment straight line over 3 years Office equipment 25% reducing balance The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Fixed asset investments Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment.
Following the issue of IFRIC11 in 2007, the Parent Company accounts for the share-based payments granted to subsidiary employees as an increase in the cost of its investment in subsidiaries.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, not including any general administrative overheads, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated net selling price less estimated total costs of completion of the finished goods.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of the sale of the asset, is initially recorded at cost.
Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, cost differs from the nominal amount which will actually be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, no adjustment is made to the cost of the land, the difference being charged as a finance cost.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these options, and provisions made accordingly to reflect loss of value.
The impairment reviews consider the period elapsed since the date of purchase of the option given that the option contract has not been exercised at the review date.
Further, the impairment reviews consider the remaining life of the option, taking account of any concerns over whether the remaining time available will allow successful exercise of the option.
The carrying cost of the option at the date of exercise is included within the cost of land purchased as a result of the option exercise.
Investments in land without the benefit of planning consent, either through purchase of freehold land or non refundable deposits paid on land purchase contracts subject to residential planning consent, are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these investments, and provision made to reflect any irrecoverable element.
The impairment reviews consider the existing use value of the land and assesses the likelihood of achieving residential planning consent and the value thereof.
Ground rents are held at an estimate of cost based on a multiple of ground rent income, with a corresponding credit created against cost of sales, in the year in which the ground rent first becomes payable by the leasehold purchaser.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Available for sale financial assets Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity in retained earnings, with the exceptions of impairment losses and interest calculated using the effective interest rate method, which are recognised directly in the income statement.
Where the investment is disposed of, or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
46 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.
co. uk plc Notes to the financial statements continued Own shares held by ESOP trust Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity through an own shares held reserve.
Employee benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Revised : Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit schemes, the net obligation is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such benefits measured at discounted present value, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The discount rate used to discount the benefits accrued is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2: Share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS1, IFRS2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in the form of share options over shares in the Parent Company.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant calculated using an independent option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity.
Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products and services business segment, or in providing products and services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
As the Groups main operation is that of a housebuilder and it operates entirely within the United Kingdom, there are no separate segments, either business or geographic, to disclose.
Exceptional items Items that are both material in size and unusual or infrequent in nature are presented as exceptional items in the income statement.
The Directors are of the opinion that the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Groups underlying business performance.
Examples of events that, inter alia, may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional are the restructuring of existing and newly-acquired businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses or individual assets and asset impairments, including currently developable land, work in progress and goodwill.
Restructuring costs Restructuring costs are recognised in the income statement when the Group has a detailed plan that has been communicated to the affected parties.
A liability is accrued for unpaid restructuring costs.
Bovis Homes Group PLC 47 Notes to the financial statements continued Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations that have been published.
All of these have been endorsed by the EU with the exception of the revisions to IAS27, IAS39 and IFRS3, IFRIC12, IFRIC15 and IFRIC16, and are therefore mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The Group has not early-adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation.
The standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to impact upon the Group are: IFRS8 Operating Segments.
IFRS8 amends the current segmental reporting requirements of IAS14 and requires a management approach to be adopted so that segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
This standard will apply to the Group from the accounting period commencing 1 January 2009 and is not expected to impact upon the Groups current segmental reporting approach.
This amendment requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of the asset.
The option of immediately expensing these borrowing costs is removed.
This amendment will apply to the Group from the accounting period commencing 1 January 2009 and the Group is assessing whether the amendment is applicable to the Group, and if so, its likely effect.
IFRIC14 IAS19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their interaction.
IFRIC14 states when refunds or reductions in future contributions can be treated as available under IAS19 and how a minimum funding requirement affects future contributions or may give rise to a liability.
This interpretation applies to the Group from the accounting period commencing on 1 January 2009, however the Group anticipates that no additional liabilities will be recognised upon the adoption of IFRIC14.
Non-vesting conditions are to be taken into account in the estimate of the fair value of the equity instruments: vesting conditions that are not market conditions are not taken into account.
This amendment will apply to the Group from 1 January 2009: its impact is currently being assessed.
Revision of IAS1 presentation of financial statements.
This revision to IAS1 is applicable from 1 January 2009, and is expected to affect the presentation and classification of certain items within the Groups financial statements.
Following this revision, transaction costs must be expensed, rather than included as costs of acquisition, and contingent consideration will require to be fair valued.
In addition, there will be a choice of two goodwill measurement methods where less than 100% of the entity is acquired.
This revision will apply to the Group from 1 January 2010, and although it will have no impact on implementation, it will have an impact on any future acquisitions.
An amendment to IAS39 Eligible hedged items.
The amendment makes two significant changes.
It prohibits designating inflation as a hedgeable component of a fixed rate debt.
It also prohibits including time value in the one-sided hedged risk when designating options as hedges.
The amendment will apply to the Group from 1 January 2010, and its impact is expected to be minimal until the Group enters into any cash flow hedges.
Part 1 of the improvements to IFRS project has a number of smaller amendments to existing IAS and IFRS, which have implementation dates at various points during 2009.
The impact of these amendments is currently being assessed.
IFRIC15 Agreements for the construction of real estate.
IFRIC15 provides guidance on whether the construction of real estate should be accounted for under IAS11 or IAS18.
The Group already accounts for the construction of real estate in accordance with IFRIC15 and accordingly this interpretation, which is effective from 1 January 2009, will have no impact upon the Group.
The adoption of the following standards, amendments and interpretations are not expected to have any material impact on the financial statements of the Group: IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
IFRIC13 requires the credits given as part of customer loyalty schemes to be recognised at their fair value as a separate component of revenue.
The revenue related to these schemes should only be recognised when the entitys obligations are fulfilled.
This interpretation applies to the Group from 1 January 2009.
IFRIC16 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
IFRIC 16 guides an investing company on the designation of, and accounting for, hedges in foreign operations.
This interpretation will apply to the Group from 1 January 2009.
Amendments to IAS32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS1 Presentation of financial statements for certain puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation require some financial instruments that meet the definition of a financial liability to be classified as equity, where certain strict criteria are met.
These amendments will apply to the Group from 1 January 2009.
IAS27 revised Consolidated and separate financial statements.
The amendments relate, primarily, to accounting for non-controlling interests and the loss of control of a subsidiary, and will apply to the Group from 1 January 2010.
Prior year restatement In 2007, the cashflow statement movement in trade and other payables was understated by 4,630,000 and the movement in provisions and employee benefits was overstated by an equal and opposite amount.
In the 2008 Report and Accounts, in the prior year cashflow statement comparatives, the movement in trade and other payables is now 44,149,000 previously 39,519,000 and the movement in provisions and other employee benefits is now 1,671,000 previously 6,301,000.
Finalisation of the fair valuation exercise arising on acquisition of Elite Homes Group Ltd in 2007 has now taken place.
This has had the effect of increasing goodwill arising on acquisition as at 31 December 2007 from the previously reported 9,176,000 to 10,036,000, reducing inventories to 869,355,000 previously reported 870,550,000 and increasing deferred tax to 3,568,000 previously 3,233,000.

Exceptional items Write-down of inventories The Group has reviewed the carrying costs of its inventory items, comparing the carrying costs of the asset against estimates of net realisable value.
Net realisable value has been arrived at using the Boards estimates of achievable selling prices taking into account current market conditions, and after deduction of an appropriate amount for selling costs.
This has given rise to a land write-down totalling 69.9 million and a write-down of 5.3 million on unsold part-exchange properties: a provision of 75.2 million in total.
Impairment of goodwill At 31 December 2008 the Group conducted an impairment review of its goodwill as explained in note 13.
This resulted in a 10.0 million write-down, reflecting the write-off of all goodwill held at the balance sheet date.
Restructuring costs During the year ended 31 December 2008 the Group incurred 5.7 million 2007: nil of costs in relation to reorganising and restructuring the Group.
Of this total, 4.6 million related to staff redundancies.
Other exceptional items The Group has reviewed the carrying value of its fixed assets, and has made a 1.0 million provision to reflect the impairment to carrying values of its freehold offices following a fall in commercial property values during 2008.
The Group has also taken an impairment charge to income relating to the impairment of its available-for-sale financial assets, totalling 1.2 million.
Directors and employees Information relating to directors remuneration, compensation for loss of office, long term incentive plan, share options and pension entitlements appears in the Report on directors remuneration on pages 30 to 38.
The directors are considered to be the only key management personnel.
The Company bears the costs of non-executive director fees and these fees are recharged to subsidiary companies within the Group.

Goodwill The Group recognised 9,176,000 of goodwill on acquisition of Elite Homes Group Ltd in 2007, following the provisional completion of the fair valuation exercise.
The Group finalised this fair valuation exercise in 2008, prior to the expiry of 12 months from the date of acquisition of Elite Homes Group Ltd.
Following finalisation of the fair value review of the assets and liabilities acquired, the Group reduced the fair value of the assets acquired by 860,000, adjusting goodwill upwards accordingly.
As these adjustments were made to the provisional fair value of assets and goodwill as at 31 December 2007, finalisation of this exercise has required restatement of the previously disclosed fair value of inventory, deferred tax and goodwill arising on acquisition.
Accordingly, as at 31 December 2007 goodwill is now reported as 10,036,000 previously 9,176,000, deferred tax is now reported as 3,568,000 peviously 3,233,000 and inventory is now reported as 869,355,000 previously 870,550,000.
The outcome of the completed fair valuation exercise can be presented as follows: Pre Fair value Fair acquisition adjustment value 000 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 278 - 278 Inventory 69,175 904 70,079 Trade and other receivables 1,428 - 1,428 Cash and cash equivalents 1,051 - 1,051 Trade and other payables 10,269 - 10,269 Current tax 2,025 - 2,025 Deferred tax - 273 273 Total 61,586 631 62,217 Goodwill 10,036 Consideration 72,253 Following the full integration of Elite Homes Group Ltd with the Bovis Homes Northern region in 2008, the Group determined that the income generating unit carrying the goodwill is the combined Bovis Homes Northern region, reflecting the Groups view that goodwill on acquisition arose from the synergy cost benefits available from the combination, and secondly that the acquisition would give rise to additional expertise in land buying in the northern geography.
At the end of December 2008, the Group reviewed the carrying value of the goodwill arising on acquisition of Elite Homes Group Ltd, given indications of impairment such as falling house prices, and the restructuring of the Northern business of Bovis Homes.
Using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.7% and assuming the existing land bank is built and sold over a four year period, at current prices, and no further land is acquired in the region, the value-in-use of the income generating unit was lower than the carrying value of the assets.
Accordingly, the Group has fully impaired the goodwill it was carrying.

The Group does not receive a tax deduction for this difference between fair value and nominal value when it is charged to the income statement, a tax deduction being obtained at a later date when the associated land cost is charged on legal completion of the house sale.
As at 31 December 2008, 11,546,000 2007: 11,066,000 of finance costs had not received a tax deduction.
The Group anticipates obtaining a current tax deduction in respect of this in the future and has therefore created a deferred tax asset to reflect this future tax deduction.
Employee benefits The Group recognises the deficit or surplus on its defined benefits pension scheme under the requirements of IAS19 Revised : Employee benefits.
This has generated a deficit of 6.8 million 2007: surplus of 1.0 million.
As at 31 December 2008 a deferred tax asset of 1,901,000 2007: liability 282,000 was recognised.

Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets relate to legal completions where the Group has retained an equity interest through agreement to defer recovery of a percentage of the market value of the property, together with a legal charge to protect the Groups position.
Typically, amounts are receivable ten years after recognition, during which time no interest is charged over the first five years, and 3% per annum is charged during the next five years.
These loans are held at the present value of expected future cash flows taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated date of recovery.
An impairment has arisen due to the impact on the fair value of these assets as a result of the decline in UK house prices.

Loss per share Basic loss per share The calculation of basic loss per share at 31 December 2008 was based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of 58,995,000.
2007: profit of 86,859,000 and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2008 of 120,268,986 2007: 119,984,811, calculated as follows: Loss profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 2008 2007 000 000 Loss profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders 58,995 86,859 Weighted average number of ordinary shares 2008 2007 Issued ordinary shares at 1 January 120,830,148 120,576,542 Effect of own shares held 650,969 712,139 Effect of shares issued in year 89,807 120,408 Weighted average number of ordinary shares at 31 December 120,268,986 119,984,811 Basic earnings per ordinary share before exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2008 is calculated on the pre-exceptional profit after tax of 11,075,000 for 2008 2007: 86,859,000.
Basic loss per share on exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2008 is calculated on the exceptional loss after tax of 70,070,000 for 2008 2007: nil.
In both cases this is expressed on a per share basis using the weighted average share information disclosed above.
Diluted loss per share Under normal circumstances, the average number of shares is diluted in reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the period.
This dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price.
The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the period.
Only share options which have met their cumulative performance criteria have been included in the dilution calculation.
However, as a loss per share cannot be reduced through dilution, this dilution adjustment has been applied to the calculation of diluted earnings per share before exceptional items, but not to the calculation of diluted loss per share or diluted loss on exceptional items per share.
The calculation of diluted loss per share at 31 December 2008 was based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of 58,995,000 2007: profit of 86,859,000 and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2008 of 120,268,986 2007: 120,244,911.
The calculation of diluted loss on exceptional items per share at 31 December 2008 was based on the exceptional loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of 70,070,000 2007: nil and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2008 of 120,268,986 2007: 120,244,911.

Financial risk management The Group seeks to manage its capital in such a manner that the Group safeguards its ability to continue as a going concern and to fund its future development.
In continuing as a going concern, it seeks to provide for returns for shareholders as well as enabling repayment of its liabilities as a trading business.
The Groups capital comprises its shareholders equity, added together with its net borrowings stated before issue costs.
A five year record of its capital employed is displayed on page 68 together with a return on capital employed, which indicates that the Group has historically delivered both absolute growth in capital and a return on capital employed of over 20%, although not in 2008.
Whilst the blended cost of capital is a factor in the Groups decision making in assessing the right blend of shareholders equity and debt financing, the Group has typically preferred to operate within a framework that features relatively low gearing.
This is because the Group recognises that housebuilding can be cyclical, and higher levels of gearing can create profound liquidity risks.
The Group would seek to manage its capital base through control over expenditure, maintenance of adequate banking facilities, control over dividend payments and in the longer term through adjustments to its capital structure.
Following the sharp market movements in 2008, the Group has seen a fall in its capital employed in 2008, as inventory provisions have reduced the asset base of the Group, leading to a reduction in retained earnings and thus shareholders equity.
An important part of capital management for the Group is its financial instruments, which comprise cash, bank loans and overdrafts, and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The use of these carries risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Given that the Group trades exclusively in the UK, there is no material currency risk.

Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business and interest rate swaps are used where appropriate to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Throughout the year, the Groups policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Hedging The Group mitigates its exposure to changes in interest rates on a core level of borrowings where appropriate through procuring interest rate swaps, denominated in sterling.
The decision whether to enter into a swap, and the timing of procurement of swaps depends on a number of key variables, on which management form judgements.
These matters include management's view of likely cashflows and indebtedness, interest rate movements and other macro-economic factors looking ahead.
These assumptions are reviewed with the Group Finance Director on a periodic basis prior to any decision being made.
Decisions made by management in this area are discussed with the Board to ensure transparency of decision making.
At 31 December 2008, the Group held no interest rate swaps.
Effective interest rates and repricing analysis The interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instrument is set out in note 21.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rates, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations in the Groups earnings, given that Group borrowings are variable in terms of interest rate.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates applying for the full year would increase the Groups loss before tax by approximately 970,000 year ended 31 December 2007: increase of profit by 491,000. b.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There are certain categories of revenue where this is not the case: for instance, housing association revenues or land sales.
The largest single amount outstanding at the year end was 11.3 million, which was paid in January 2009 2007: 7.3 million.
The Group retains these outstanding balances as trade receivables, the carrying value of which equates to the Groups exposure to credit risk.
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counter parties before entering into a transaction.
This assessment is based upon management knowledge and experience.
In the event that land is disposed of the Group seeks to mitigate any credit risk by retaining a charge over the asset disposed of, so that in the event of default, the Group is able to seek to recover its outstanding asset.
c. Liquidity risk The Groups banking arrangements outlined in note 21 are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium term cash flow needs, thus mitigating its liquidity risk.
The Groups approach to assessment of liquidity risk is outlined in the section on the report on corporate governance relating to Going Concern which can be found on page 27.
Financial instruments Fair values There is no material difference between the carrying value of financial instruments shown in the balance sheet and their fair value.
Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Land purchased on extended payment terms When land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment.
Fair value is determined as the outstanding element of the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method, increasing the value of the land creditor such that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the payment required.
Land creditor estimated ageing Balance at Total contracted Due within Between Between Between Between Between 31 December cash payment 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5-6 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 2008 37,457 42,003 14,856 9,369 9,150 6,929 864 835 2007 62,684 67,561 36,573 11,414 8,340 6,184 5,050 - Interest bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest flows.
Interest rate swaps At each period end, an external valuation of the fair value of each interest rate swap is obtained from the relevant swap providers.
Trade and other receivables payables Other than land creditors, the nominal value of trade receivables and payables is deemed to reflect the fair value.
This is due to the fact that transactions which give rise to these trade receivables and payables arise in the normal course of trade with industry standard payment terms.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The Group uses an instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate to determine the fair value of financial instruments.
For the year ended 31 December 2008 the interest rate used to discount was 6.5% year ended 31 December 2007: 6.5%.

Operating leases Leases as lessee Non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payable as follows: Group 2008 2007 000 000 Less than one year 155 52 Between one and five years 435 117 More than five years - - Operating leases 590 169 With regard to the operating leases held by the Group as lessor, the Group recognised 441,000 of rental income in the income statement in 2008 2007: 680,000.
262,000 related to the temporary rental of surplus office space by the Group 2007: 245,000.
The remainder primarily related to the ground rents collected on the freehold of leasehold apartments sold by the Group prior to the freehold disposal.
Capital commitments The Group is committed to incur capital expenditure of nil 2007: 65,000.
This relates to plant and equipment.
Contingencies The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of bonds and other agreements entered into in the normal course of business and the Company has guaranteed the performance of certain of these agreements entered into by its subsidiary companies.
The Company had guaranteed the repayment of bank loans made to one of its subsidiaries under a syndicated loan facility agreement which amounted to 120 million at 31 December 2008 31 December 2007: 41 million.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Land held for development and housing work in progress The Group holds inventories which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
To assess the net realisable value of land held for development and housing work in progress, the Group completes a financial appraisal of the likely revenue which will be generated when these inventories are combined as residential properties for sale and sold.
Where the financial appraisal demonstrates that the revenue will exceed the costs of the inventories and other associated costs of constructing the residential properties, the inventories are stated at cost.
Where the assessed revenue is lower, the extent to which there is a shortfall is written off through the income statement leaving the inventories stated at a recoverable value.
To the extent that the revenues which can be generated change, or the final cost to complete the site varies from estimates, the net realisable value of the inventories may be different.
A review taking into account estimated achievable net revenues, actual inventory and costs to complete as at 6 March 2009 has been carried out, which has identified the requirement for a carrying value provision of 69.9 million as at 31 December 2008.
These estimates were made by local management having regard to actual selling prices, together with competitor and marketplace evidence, and were further reviewed by Group management.
Should there be a further significant decline in UK house pricing, then further write-downs of land and work in progress may be necessary.
Part exchange properties The carrying values of part exchange properties are assessed based on external valuations completed on the properties.
These valuations are based on the prevailing market conditions in the second hand housing market and to the extent that housing market pricing levels change, the achievable values of the part exchange properties may vary.
Part exchange property values at the end of the financial year were based on up to date valuations and were based on realistic market expectations.
Financial instruments The Group mitigates its exposure to interest rates through using interest rate swaps where appropriate.
These interest rate swaps are held at their fair value.
This fair value is based on the likely income or cost associated with terminating the swap at the balance sheet date.
Where interest rates are volatile, the fair value of the interest rate swaps may vary as interest rates change.
The Group held no interest rate swaps at the end of 2008, or at the end of 2007.
Pension assumptions The Group has utilised a range of assumptions including a rate of return on assets, a discount rate and mortality assumptions having been advised by its actuary.
To the extent that such assumed rates are different from what actually transpires, the pension liability of the Group would change.
Goodwill At least annually, the Group assesses its goodwill to understand whether impairment is indicated.
This assessment requires judgement in estimating future cash flows and in selecting an appropriate discount rate by which to perform a value-in-use calculation and so to determine the present value of cash flows and thus recoverable amounts.
Available-for-sale financial assets The estimation of the current value of available-for-sale financial assets requires judgement and estimation as to the quantum, timing and value of repayment of the Group's asset.
