The bond issuance was subsequently postponed as a result of adverse market conditions and the 364-day facility was retained to provide additional working capital headroom.
The facility agreement has a term-out option, exercisable at the Groups discretion, for an additional one year period and, as such, the final maturity date of the facility is June 2009.
The facility was undrawn at 29 March 2008 and the term-out option had not been exercised at that date.
The facility agreement is similar to that used for the 550m RCF and the covenant package is identical.
50m term loan: The five year bi-lateral 50m term loan, which was signed in December 2005, is fully drawn in Sterling and has a fixed margin.
The loan is repayable in full in December 2010 and has a covenant package identical to that in the 550m RCF.
225m term loan: The 225m term loan, which was signed in February 2006, is fully drawn in Euro and the interest rate is calculated in a similar manner to the 550m RCF.
The loan is repayable in full in February 2011 and has a covenant package identical to that in the 550m RCF.
375m term loan: In October 2006, the Group agreed a new term loan facility of 375m to assist with the acquisition of AOLs UK internet access business.
The maximum term of this facility is seven years, comprising a five year initial term and two one-year extension options, which are exercisable at the discretion of the bank group.
The first of these extension options has been successfully exercised and, if the second extension option is exercised, the final maturity date will be October 2013.
The terms of the new facility are similar to the Groups other committed bank facilities, and the covenant package is identical to that in the 550m RCF.
This facility was fully drawn in Swiss Francs at 29 March 2008.
