EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND CERTAIN RE-MEASUREMENTS i Exceptional items During the year, the Group disposed of telecoms sites assets to the Wireless Infrastructure Company Limited, for a total potential consideration of 79.0m.
The gain recognised on this disposal is 55.0m.
This gain has been disclosed separately in the income statement.
The Group incurred an unhedged translation loss of 22.2m on Euro-denominated debt held in relation to the acquisition of Airtricity Holdings Limited see note 14.
This has been recognised as exceptional following the Groups decision to restructure the borrowings associated with this element of the acquisition in order to match Sterling exposures with Sterling funding.
As a consequence this translation loss is a non-recurring item.
