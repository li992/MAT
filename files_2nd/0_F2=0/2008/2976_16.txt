Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2008 59 24 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a variety of pension schemes, principally in the UK, The Netherlands and Belgium.
They comprise defined benefit schemes where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary, and defined contribution schemes where the respective company pays a set contribution to the scheme.
The UK defined benefit schemes referred to in 24 i a and the first two defined contribution schemes referred to in 24 ii are accounted for by the Group.
i Defined benefit schemes a UK defined benefit schemes The Company operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay for its employees and assumed the liability for the scheme previously operated by Storeys Carpets Ltd Storeys.
The Company scheme was closed to new members on 31 March 2006.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company, those of the Company scheme being invested in a Managed Fund operated by SEI.
Contributions are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial review was at 6 April 2005 when the actuarial value of the assets represented 91% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The Storeys scheme is also closed to new members and the assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in independently managed funds.
The most recent actuarial review of the Storeys scheme was at 1 March 2005.
The Storeys scheme has only one active member.
The numbers set out below are the aggregate of the two schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 3 May 2008 by a qualified actuary.
1 Key assumptions used: 2008 2007 % % Expected rate of salary increases 4.3 3.8 Expected rate of pension increases 3.5 3.0 Discount rate 6.5 5.4 Expected rate of inflation 3.5 3.0 Expected return on schemes assets 6.9 7.0 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The assumptions used for future life expectancy of members of the schemes are derived from industry dates and standard tables.
Specifically the PMA 92 table with medium cohort improvement has been used for male pensioners and the PFA 92 table with medium cohort improvement for female pensioners projected by year of birth.
The most significant assumptions are the expected return on scheme assets, salary increases and the discount rate, of which the most sensitive assumption is the discount rate.
If this assumption increased or decreased by 0.1% the defined benefit obligation would change by 0.2 million 2007: 0.2 million.

It is not possible to identify the Groups share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme, and therefore in accordance with IAS 19, the Group has taken the exemption for multi-employer pension schemes not to disclose pension scheme assets and liabilities.
Accordingly, although this scheme is a defined benefit scheme it is treated as a defined contribution scheme recognising the contributions payable in each period in the income statement.
Under the terms of the scheme the scheme deficit is recovered through increased contributions from participating members.
At the period end the Group was unable to obtain a valuation of the industry schemes full surplus or deficit.
Contributions charged to the income statement amounted to 0.7 million 2007: 0.6 million.
ii Defined contribution schemes With effect from 31 March 2006 the Company closed a defined contribution pension scheme to further contributions.
Contributions made up until that date by employees were matched by the Company to an upper limit.
The assets of the pension scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested by the National Provident Institution.
No Company contributions were made to this scheme in the current or previous period.
The Company launched a Group Personal Pension Plan GPP Plan in April 2006.
Contributions made by employees are matched by the Company to an upper limit.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested by Scottish Life.
Contributions for the period amounted to 0.8 million 2007: 0.7 million.
In addition, the Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for subsidiary companies in Belgium and The Netherlands.
The Group makes contributions into the schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group and are invested by local insurance companies.
The contributions by the Group into individual company schemes for the period were a net charge of nil 2007: nil and contributions to industry collective schemes were 0.1 million 2007: 0.1 million.
62 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2008 Notes to the accounts continued 25 Financial instruments i Financial risk management objectives and policies Risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, borrowings and overdrafts, cash and cash equivalents.
These financial instruments are used to manage funding and liquidity requirements.
Other financial instruments which arise directly from the Groups operations include trade receivables and payables.
Exposure to credit, liquidity, foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks arise in the normal course of the Groups business operations and each of these risks are managed in accordance with the Groups treasury risk management strategy, which is also discussed in the Business Review in the section Capital Structure and Treasury Policy.
a Credit risk The Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk as exposure is spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables, the majority of which relates to retail customers see Note 17.
Retail customers are required to settle outstanding balances in cash or using a major credit card prior to goods being collected from delivered by the store.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with a minimum AA credit rating.
The maximum amount of credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts of financial assets.
b Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations from a mix of retained profits and bank borrowings achieved through term loans, revolving credit agreements and overdraft facilities.
Daily cash balances are forecast and surplus cash is placed on treasury deposit with the Groups bankers at commercial rates.
All counterparties have an investment graded rating.
There are a number of covenants which commit the Group to maintaining certain rates of operating cash flow to fixed charge cover, and interest and capital repayments cover.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest Less than Between one Between two one year and two years and five years Over five years Total m m m m m Group At 3 May 2008 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 22.4 4.5 33.4 1.4 61.7 Finance leases 0.8 0.9 0.3 2.7 4.7 Trade and other payables 99.4 99.4 122.6 5.4 33.7 4.1 165.8 At 28 April 2007 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 12.2 3.8 5.6 1.6 23.2 Finance leases 0.8 0.8 1.1 1.8 4.5 Trade and other payables 93.1 93.1 106.1 4.6 6.7 3.4 120.8 Company At 3 May 2008 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 11.5 3.1 32.0 46.6 Finance leases 0.8 0.9 0.3 1.7 3.7 Trade and other payables 84.1 84.1 96.4 4.0 32.3 1.7 134.4 At 28 April 2007 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 6.9 6.9 Finance leases 0.8 0.8 1.1 1.8 4.5 Trade and other payables 80.9 80.9 88.6 0.8 1.1 1.8 92.3 Committed overdraft facilities are renewable annually and amounts undrawn were 26.5 million andB10.6 million 2007: 35.0 million andB13.6 million.

This facility had an undrawn amount of 5.0 million 2007: nil.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2008 63 25 Financial instruments continued c Foreign exchange risk Outside the UK the Group operates in the Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands, Belgium, Poland and Germany.
Revenues and expenses of these operations are denominated in Euros or Zlotys.
The Groups investment in Poland is currently not material.
The Group mitigates currency risk in respect of the net investment in European operations by designating Euro denominated borrowings as hedging instruments of Euro denominated investments in foreign operations.
If the closing Sterling-Euro rate had been 0.01 points lower in the period the exchange difference reported in the SORIE would have been 0.2 million lower 2007: 0.1 million lower.
At 3 May 2008 if Sterling had weakened strengthened by 1% against the Euro post tax profit for the year would have been 0.1 million higher lower as a result of the translation of the Euro denominated businesses.
If the closing Sterling-Zloty rate had been 0.1 points lower in the period the exchange difference reported in the SORIE would have been 0.1 million lower 2007: nil.
Financial assets and liabilities and foreign operations are translated at the following rates of exchange: Euro Euro Zloty Zloty 2008 2007 2008 2007 Average rate 1.40 1.48 5.25 5.77 Closing rate 1.28 1.47 4.42 5.54 d Interest rate risk The Group has various borrowings bearing interest at a margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR rates.
Interest rate risk is managed by purchasing interest rate swap agreements to hedge at least 75% of permanent borrowings.
The remaining 25% is liable to interest at prevailing interest rates.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of hedging instruments in place at 3 May 2008 and 28 April 2007 respectively.
Consequently analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move: gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in Note 1: cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end a 1% change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.1 million 2007: 0.1 million.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group, after the impact of interest rate swaps is as follows: 2008 2007 Weighted Weighted average average effective Floating Fixed Interest effective Floating Fixed Interest interest rate rate rate free Total interest rate rate rate free Total % m m m m % m m m m Sterling 8.1 8.1 3.4 11.6 7.3 18.9 Euro 0.5 8.6 4.5 13.1 0.4 8.8 0.1 3.4 12.3 Zloty 0.2 0.2 0.5 0.3 0.3 Total financial assets 8.8 12.6 21.4 20.7 0.1 10.7 31.5 Sterling 1.4 31.4 4.7 86.8 122.9 0.9 0.3 4.5 80.8 85.6 Euro 3.2 11.1 19.2 12.1 42.4 2.4 6.9 16.0 11.8 34.7 Zloty 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 Total financial liabilities 42.5 23.9 99.4 165.8 7.2 20.5 93.1 120.8 Capital management The Group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining an appropriate debt equity capital structure.
It uses a number of mechanisms to manage debt equity levels, as appropriate, in the light of economic and trading conditions and the future capital investment requirements of the business, including share buy back to return funds to shareholders.

The carrying values of all other financial assets and liabilities are deemed to reflect fair value.
iii Derivative financial instruments The Group has various Euro and Sterling-denominated borrowings which bear interest at floating rates.
Interest on the Sterling borrowing is charged at LIBOR plus a margin.
The Euro-denominated borrowings bear interest at the prevailing EURIBOR rate plus a margin.
Interest rate swaps were purchased to fix at least 75% of the floating interest charges due within the next three years at fixed rates of interest ranging from 3.19% to 4.55% 2007: 2.66% to 4.66%.
The maturity profiles of the interest rate swaps match that of the underlying hedged borrowings.
Derivative financial instruments are not purchased for speculative purposes.

Hedge documentation is put in place at inception of all hedging relationships.
Effectiveness tests are performed at each reporting date.
Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value under IAS 39.
Changes in fair value are posted to equity in respect of the portion of the hedges which satisfy the criteria to be effective hedges.
Charges or credits relating to the portion which does not satisfy these criteria are recognised directly in the income statement.
Cash flows in respect of the interest rate swaps are expected to occur at the same dates as the cash flows of the underlying hedged items.
b Net investment hedges Euro-denominated borrowings are designated as hedging instruments of Euro-denominated net assets of the Groups foreign operations in order to protect the Group from currency risk in respect of the Groups Euro-denominated foreign operations.
Borrowing balances are carried at amortised cost which approximates fair value since borrowings bear interest at the prevailing floating rate.
The carrying value of borrowings amounted toB13.2 million 2007:B9.7 million.
