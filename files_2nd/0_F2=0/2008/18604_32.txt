38 Grainger plc annual report and accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25 Trade and other receivables continued Movements on the group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Opening balance 0.7 1.0 Provision for receivables impairment during the year 1.0 0.2 Receivables written off during the period as uncollectible 0.4 0.4 Unused amounts reversed 0.1 0.1 Closing balance 1.2 0.7 The creation and release of provisions for impaired receivables have been included in property repair and maintenance costs in the consolidated income statement note 5.
Amounts provided for are written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivables mentioned above.
Tenant deposits of 0.7m 2007: 0.6m are held which provide some security against rental arrears and property dilapidations caused by the tenant.
In addition, the loan to Mornington is secured as described above.
The group does not hold any other collateral as security.
26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments Financial risk management The groups objectives for managing financial risk are to minimise the risk of adverse effects on performance and to ensure the ability of the group to continue as a going concern while securing access to cost effective finance and maintaining flexibility to respond quickly to opportunities which arise.
The groups policies on financial risk management are approved by the board of directors and implemented by group treasury.
Written policies and procedures cover interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance is monitored by internal auditors.
Group treasury reports to the risk committee.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to financial risk but does not take positions for speculative purposes.
The sources of financial risk and the policies and activities used to mitigate each are discussed below and include credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk which includes interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, house price risk in relation to the CHARM portfolio, our financial interest in property assets, and capital risk.
Notes to the financial statements 39 26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued Categories of financial instruments A summary of the classifications of the financial assets and liabilities held by the group is set out in the following table: 2008 2007 Fair value Fair value Book value Fair value adjustment Book value Fair value adjustment m m m m m m Financial interest in property assets 121.2 121.2 131.7 131.7 Trade and other receivables 21.1 21.1 14.7 14.7 Derivative financial instruments 11.9 11.9 13.1 13.1 Cash and cash equivalents 43.2 43.2 80.1 80.1 Total financial assets 197.4 197.4 239.6 239.6 Non-current liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 1,635.4 1,644.8 9.4 1,393.8 1,396.6 2.8 Trade and other payables 4.0 4.0 8.0 8.0 Provisions for other liabilities and charges 1.0 1.0 1.2 1.2 Current liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 17.9 17.9 18.2 18.2 Trade and other payables 17.0 17.0 30.6 30.6 Derivative financial instruments 13.4 13.4 0.8 0.8 Total financial liabilities 1,688.7 1,698.1 9.4 1,452.6 1,455.4 2.8 Total net financial liabilities 1,491.3 1,500.7 9.4 1,213.0 1,215.8 2.8 The fair value adjustment relates to the groups fixed rate loan with Lloyds TSB Bank plc and the liability component of the convertible bond, both of which are stated at amortised cost in the consolidated balance sheet.
There is no requirement under IAS 39 to revalue these loans to fair value in the statutory balance sheet.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss due to a counterpartys failure to honour its obligations.
The groups principal financial assets include its financial interest in property assets, bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and financial derivatives.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
The groups financial interest in property assets relates to a financial interest in equity mortgages held by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered to be low risk as they have no history of past due or impaired amounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at the year end.
The groups principal credit risk relates to trade receivables.
Where it is identified that recovery is doubtful a provision for impairment is made.
For all Assured Shorthold Tenancies credit checks are performed prior to acceptance of the tenant.
Regulated tenants are incentivised through the benefit of their tenancy agreement to avoid default on their rent.
Lifetime tenancies are generally at low or zero rent and hence suffer minimal credit risk.
Rent deposits and personal guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account the risk to the group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables is considered low, as is borne out by the low level of trade receivables written off both in this year and in prior years.
40 Grainger plc annual report and accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed through the groups policies of monitoring counterparty exposure, concentration of credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties and the use of counterparties of good financial standing.
Cash and short-term deposits at 30 September 2008 amounted to 43.2m 2007: 80.1m.
Deposits were placed with financial institutions with Aor better credit ratings.
At 30 September 2008, the fair value of all interest rate derivatives which had a positive value was 11.9m 2007: 13.1m.
All the counterparties have investment grade credit ratings.
At 30 September 2008, the largest combined credit exposure to a single counterparty arising from money market deposits and interest rate swaps was 306.3m 2007: 280.5m which represents 14.5% 2007: 14.1% of total assets.
Liquidity risk The group ensures that it maintains continuity and flexibility through a spread of maturities.
Although the groups core funding is supported by covenants requiring certain levels of loan to value with respect to the entities in the group of obligors and to maintaining a certain level of interest cover at the group level the loan is not secured directly against any property allowing operational flexibility.
The group has comfortably complied with its covenants during 2008 and as at 30 September 2008 see note 2 on page 19.
The group ensures that it maintains sufficient cash for operational requirements at all times.
The group uses short-term money market deposits to manage its liquidity.
The group also ensures that it has sufficient undrawn committed borrowing facilities from a diverse range of banks to allow for operational flexibility and to meet committed expenditure on its developments.
The core business in particular is very cash generative from its gross rents and sales of trading properties.
In adverse trading conditions, new acquisitions can be stopped and, consequently, the group is able to reduce gearing levels and improve liquidity quickly.
The following table analyses the groups financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities at the balance sheet date into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
As the amounts included in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, these amounts will not equal the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet for borrowings, derivative financial instruments, trade and other payables and provisions for liabilities and charges.
A reconciliation to the balance sheet amounts is given on page 41.
Trade and other payables due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.
The cash flows are calculated using yield curves for floating rate interest-bearing liabilities.
Foreign currency related cash flows are calculated by means of the forward rates relevant to each maturity date.

Market risk The group is exposed to market risk through interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations, the availability of credit and house price movements relating to the CHARM portfolio.
The approach the group takes to each of these risks is set out below.
The group is not exposed to equity price risk nor to commodity price risk.
Fair values The fair value of swaps and other financial instruments is derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates obtained by means of the current yield curve appropriate for those instruments.
42 Grainger plc annual report and accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued The following financial instruments were in existence as at 30 September 2008: 2008 2007 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Interest rate swaps cash flow hedges in hedge accounting relationships 8.4 1.2 9.5 0.1 Interest rate swaps cash flow hedges not in hedge accounting relationships 3.5 12.2 3.6 0.7 11.9 13.4 13.1 0.8 Interest rate swaps are all classified as either current assets or current liabilities.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 30 September 2008 was 1,228.3m 2007: 847.3m.
The fair value movement relating to cash flow hedges not in hedge accounting relationships amounted to a charge of 11.5m 2007: credit of 3.0m.
All of the financial derivatives included in the above table were valued by external consultants, using a discounted cash flow model and quoted market information.
They were checked internally using a bespoke software package.
In accordance with IAS 39, the group has reviewed its interest rate hedges.
In the absence of hedge accounting, movements in fair value would have been taken directly to the income statement.
However, where cash flow hedges have been viewed as being effective any gains or losses have been taken to equity through the cash flow hedge reserve.
A valuation was carried out at 30 September 2008 by external consultants, to calculate the market value of the groups fixed rate debt on a replacement basis, taking into account the difference between the fixed interest rates for the groups borrowings and the market value and prevailing interest rate of appropriate debt instruments as a fair value adjustment.
The fair value compared to the carrying amounts of the groups fixed rate financial liabilities at 30 September 2008 is analysed below.
Book value at Fair value at 30 September 30 September 2008 2008 Fixed rate loan facilities 153.6 163.0 Book value at Fair value at 30 September 30 September 2007 2007 Fixed rate loan facilities 152.5 155.3 Interest rate risk The groups interest rate risk arises from the risk of fluctuations in interest charges on floating rate borrowings.
The group mitigates this risk through the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
This subjects the group to fair value risk as the value of the financial derivatives fluctuates in line with variations in interest rates.
However, the group seeks to cash flow hedge account where applicable.
The group is, however, driven by commercial considerations when hedging its interest rate risk and is not driven by the strict requirements of the hedge accounting rules under IAS 39 if this is to the detriment of achieving the best commercial arrangement.
Hedging activities are carried out under the terms of the groups hedging policies and are regularly reviewed by the board to ensure compliance with this policy.
The board reviews its policy on interest rate exposure regularly with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
The current group treasury policy is to maintain floating rate exposure of no greater than 35% of expected borrowing.
As at 30 September 2008, 85% 2007: 74% of the groups net borrowings were economically hedged to fixed or capped rates.
Notes to the financial statements 43 26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued As at 30 September 2008, the market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net asset of 7.2m 2007: 9.4m.
The movement in fair value measured in the income statement on cash flow hedges in the year ended 30 September 2008 was a charge of 11.5m 2007: credit of 3.0m.
At 30 September 2008, the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net liability of 8.7m 2007: asset of 2.9m.
The cash flows occur and enter in the determination of profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.
The table below summarises debt hedged at 30 September 2008.
The weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is nine years 2007: 10 years.
The weighted average interest rate of the euro fixed rate debt is 0.5% 2007: 0.5%.
The weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 42 years 2007: 43 years.
Based on the groups interest rate profile at the balance sheet date a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 3.3m 2007: 4.1m.
Similarly a 1% decrease would increase annual profits by 5.3m 2007: 6.9m.
This has been calculated to include the effect of hedge accounting.
Upward movements in medium and long-term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectation, increase the value of the groups interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves.
The converse is true for downward movements in the yield curve.
Where the groups swaps qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39, these movements in fair value are recognised directly in equity rather than the income statement.
Foreign exchange risk The groups foreign exchange risk arises from the exposure due to translating overseas trading performance and overseas net assets into sterling and it does not have foreign currency trading with cross border currency flows.
The group hedges foreign currency assets naturally by funding them through borrowings in the applicable foreign currency and aims to ensure that it has no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.
Profit translation is not hedged.
44 Grainger plc annual report and accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 26 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued The groups balance sheet translation exposure is summarised below: 2008 2007 2008 2007 Euro Euro Czech Koruna Czech Koruna m m m m Gross foreign currency assets 454.4 257.5 9.2 8.8 Gross foreign currency liabilities 449.9 245.2 3.9 Net exposure 4.5 12.3 9.2 4.9 As at 30 September 2008 it is estimated that a general increase decrease of 10 percentage points in the value of Sterling against the Euro would increase decrease the groups profit before tax by approximately 1.2m 2007: 1.2m and equity by 0.5m 2007: 1.2m.
As at 30 September 2008 it is estimated that a general increase decrease of 10 percentage points in the value of Sterling against the Czech Koruna would increase decrease the groups profit before tax by approximately 0.3m 2007: 0.1m and equity by 0.9m 2007: 0.5m.
In 2007 the group also had an investment of 1m in Tallin.
The sensitivities against movements in the Estonian Kroon are not considered material.
Credit availability risk Credit availability risk relates to the groups ability to refinance its borrowings at the end of their terms or to secure additional financing where necessary.
The group maintains relationships with a range of lenders and maintains sufficient headroom through committed borrowings.
House price risk The cash flows arising from the groups financial interest in property assets CHARM are related to the movement in value of the underlying property assets and, therefore, are subject to movements in house prices.
However, consistent with the groups approach to house price risk across its portfolio of trading and investment properties the group does not seek to eliminate this risk as it is a fundamental part of the groups business model.
At 30 September 2008 it is estimated that, with respect to the groups financial interest in property assets a general increase decrease of one percentage point in house prices would increase decrease the groups profit before tax by approximately 1m 2007: 1m.
Capital risk management The board manages the groups capital through the regular review of: cash flow projections, the ability of the group to meet contractual commitments, covenant tests, dividend cover and gearing.
The group manages the level of its equity shareholders funds by means of dividends, share purchases and share issues.
Loans within the group have associated covenant requirements with respect to loan to value and interest cover ratios.
The board regularly reviews all covenants and projected future levels to monitor anticipated compliance and available headroom against key thresholds.
For the group as a whole the board does not have a specific loan to value target but it is reviewed in the context of the boards view of markets, the prospects of and risks relating to the portfolio and the recurring cash flows of the business.
The group monitors its cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital WACC on a regular basis.
Investment and development opportunities are evaluated using the WACC in order to ensure long-term shareholder value is created.
Certain group subsidiaries are regulated by the Financial Services Authority and therefore have externally applied capital adequacy requirements, however, these do no have any material impact on the group as a whole.
