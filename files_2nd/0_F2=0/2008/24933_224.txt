Interested directors Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and provided that the Articles are complied with, a Director, notwithstanding his office: may enter into or otherwise be interested in any contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal with HSBC Holdings or in which HSBC Holdings is otherwise interested: may hold any other office or place of profit under HSBC Holdings except that of auditor or auditor of a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings in conjunction with the office of Director and may act by himself or through his firm in a professional capacity for HSBC Holdings, and in any such case on such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the Board may arrange: may be a director or other officer, or employed by, or a party to any transaction or arrangement with or otherwise interested in, any company promoted by HSBC Holdings or in which HSBC Holdings is otherwise interested or as regards which HSBC Holdings has any powers of appointment: and shall not be liable to account to HSBC Holdings for any profit, remuneration or other benefit realised by any such office, employment, contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal or from any interest in any body corporate and no such contract, arrangement, transaction, proposal or interest shall be avoided on the grounds of any such interest or benefit nor shall the receipt of any such profit, remuneration or any other benefit constitute a breach of his duty under the Companies Act 2006 not to accept benefits from third parties.
Since 1 October 2008, the Board may authorise any matter proposed to it which would, if not so authorised, involve a breach by a Director of his duty to avoid conflicts of interest under the Companies Act 2006, including, without limitation, any matter which relates to a situation in which a Director has, or can have, an interest which conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interest of HSBC Holdings including the exploitation of any property, information or opportunity, whether or not HSBC Holdings could take advantage of it, but excluding any situation which cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest.
Any such authorisation will be effective only if: any requirement as to quorum at the meeting at which the matter is considered is met without counting the Director in question or any other interested Director: and the matter was agreed to without their voting or would have been agreed to if their votes had not been counted.
