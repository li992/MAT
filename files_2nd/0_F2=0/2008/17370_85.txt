For the Groups plans, the plans assets are invested with the objective of being able to meet current and future benefit payment needs, while controlling balance sheet volatility and future contributions.
Plan assets are invested with a number of investment managers, and assets are diversified among equities, bonds, insured annuities, property and cash or other liquid investments.
the primary use of bonds as an investment class is to match the anticipated cash flows from the plans to pay pensions.
Various insurance policies have also been bought historically to provide a more exact match for the cash flows, including a match for the actual mortality of specific plan members.
these insurance policies effectively provide protection against both investment fluctuations and longevity risks.
the strategic target allocation varies among the individual schemes.
