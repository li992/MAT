Derivatives and other financial instruments Set out below are the derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
The notional value of the derivative is shown as the principal value of the underlying hedged item.
The Groups portfolio of rate derivatives is diversied by maturity, counterparty and type.
Natural offsets between transactions within the portfolio and the designation of certain derivatives as hedges signicantly reduce the risk of income statement volatility.
Diversication of counterparty exposure from derivatives is managed within credit limits that ensure that there is no significant risk to any one counterparty.
In addition to this deals are only executed with counterparties that have a long-term rating of Aor better.
Included within the fair value of forward exchange contracts are a number of US dollar-denominated forward exchange contracts which the Group has taken out with counterparty banks on behalf of two of its joint ventures: The History Channel UK and Chelsea Digital Media Limited.

Group treasury activity The Groups treasury function is responsible for raising finance for the Groups operations, together with associated liquidity management and the management of foreign exchange, interest rate and credit risks.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by both the Audit Committee and the Board, which receive regular updates of treasury activity.
Derivative instruments are transacted for risk management purposes only.
It is the Groups policy that all hedging is to cover known risks and that no speculative trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
