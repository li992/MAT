Segmental analysis Primary reporting format - business segments At 31 December 2008 the Group continued to be organised on a worldwide basis into two main business segments, relating to the manufacture and sale of the Groups products which are destined for either the Consumer Care market or the market for Industrial Specialities.
There is no material trade between segments.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, inventories and trade and other receivables, whilst segment liabilities are mainly trade and other payables.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in all cases where such assets arise, as it is probable the assets will be recovered.
Deferred tax is only recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that remittance is expected in the foreseeable future.
If all earnings were remitted, an additional 3.6m of tax would be payable.
All movements on deferred tax balances have been recognised in income with the exception of the charges shown in note 5 b, which have been recognised directly in equity, the balances acquired with Uniqema and the balances transferred with business disposals in the year.

Discontinued operations In February 2008, continuing the Groups strategy of focusing on its core business, the Group sold its 46.5% shareholding in its associate, Baxenden Chemicals Limited, to Chemtura Corporation for a 13m cash consideration.
In May 2008, in line with the Groups strategic restructuring following the acquisition of Uniqema, the Groups Chicago Oleochemicals business was sold to H. I. G. Capital LLC for 46.8m, with the sale including all current and non-current assets.
The consideration included 38.6m cash and the balance as a loan note due in 2014 but repayable earlier in certain circumstances.

Retirement benefit liabilities The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes throughout the world.
The principal schemes are in the UK and cover the vast majority of the Groups UK employees.
These schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds and are funded.
In the US, the Group operates a funded defined benefit scheme as well as providing unfunded post-retirement medical benefits for employees.
In other countries benefits are determined in accordance with local practice and regulations and funding is provided on several bases.
The acquisition of Uniqema resulted in the Group inheriting that business retirement benefit obligations and associated funding.
These obligations are grouped with the obligations of the existing Croda schemes in the relevant region in the analyses below.
Defined benefit schemes The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in respect of these schemes are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Present value of retirement benefit liabilities UK - pension schemes 397.2 483.4 US - pension and medical schemes 102.9 76.5 Rest of World 109.2 83.7 609.3 643.6 Fair value of scheme assets UK - pension schemes 399.0 475.9 US - pension schemes 59.7 56.2 Rest of World 62.1 52.2 520.8 584.3 Net liability 88.5 59.3 The gross and net liability above includes an amount of 57.8m in respect of unfunded schemes 2007: 45.9m.

The following mortality tables have been used in respect of the Groups key schemes: UK: PA92 Calendar year 2005 -3 for current non-pensioners and PA92 Calendar year 2005 -2 for pensioners: USA: UP 1994 Projected to 2002 by Scale AA: Netherlands: AG Prognosetafel 2008-2050: Germany: Heubeck RT 2005G.

Intangible assets Opening goodwill at 1 January 2007 arose on the Groups acquisition of the trading assets of Westbrook Lanolin in 1998, which has been allocated in full to the Groups UK manufacturing operation and to the Consumer Care segment, and the goodwill from the acquisition of Uniqema during 2006.
As Uniqema has now been embedded into the Groups pre-acquisition structure, it is not possible to allocate the goodwill on acquisition to any individual cash-generating unit CGU other than the total Group.
Goodwill is tested at each year end for impairment with reference to the relevant CGUs recoverable amount compared to the units carrying value including goodwill.
As disclosed above, the relevant CGU when testing the Uniqema goodwill is the Group as a whole.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations using pre-tax discounted cash flow projections based on the Groups strategic plan for the first three years and a growth rate thereafter of 3% 2007:3%.
The cashflows have been discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been calculated to be approximately 7.4% before tax 2007:8%.
The key assumptions underpinning the strategic plan employed in the value in use calculation are that market share will not change significantly and that gross and operating margins will remain broadly constant.

The carrying amounts of the Groups receivables are denominated in the following currencies: 2008 2007 m m Sterling 31.2 19.2 US Dollar 67.6 46.6 Euro 53.7 89.3 Other 33.3 31.3 185.8 186.4 Movements on the Groups provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2008 2007 m m At 1 January 1.9 2.0 Exchange differences 0.7 - Charged to income statement 2.2 0.6 Net write off of uncollectible receivables 1.3 0.7 At 31 December 3.5 1.9 Amounts charged to the income statement are included within administrative expenses.

Borrowings, other financial liabilities and other financial assets continued Elements of the syndicated acquisition funding are due for repayment over the five year term of the facility, however the bulk of the facility falls due for repayment upon expiry of the agreement in June 2011.
Interest is charged at a floating rate based on LIBOR or EURIBOR, depending upon the drawdown currency, plus a variable margin.
The margin the Group pays on its borrowings over and above standard rates is determined by the Groups net debt to EBITDA ratio.
The 136m term facility all falls due for repayment in June 2011 and is on broadly similar terms to the syndicated acquisition funding.
2008 2007 m m Maturity profile of financial liabilities Repayments fall due as follows: Within one year Bank loans and overdrafts 86.8 83.4 Obligations under finance leases 0.4 0.1 87.2 83.5 After more than one year Loans repayable Within one to two years 30.8 75.0 Within two to five years 324.2 250.5 Obligations under finance leases payable between years two and five 0.6 0.4 355.6 325.9 The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as follows: Within one year 0.4 0.2 Within two to five years 0.7 0.5 1.1 0.7 Future finance charges on finance leases 0.1 0.2 Present value of finance lease liabilities 1.0 0.5 Interest rate and currency profile of Group financial liabilities Fixed rate Weighted average Interest Fixed Total Fixed Floating rate period m m m % years Sterling 176.8 100.0 76.8 5.99 1.0 US Dollar 106.2 - 106.2 - - Euro 154.6 - 154.6 - - Other 5.2 - 5.2 - - At 31 December 2008 442.8 100.0 342.8 5.99 1.0 Sterling 195.2 100.0 95.2 6.44 2.0 US Dollar 102.2 4.6 97.6 7.37 0.5 Euro currencies 109.8 - 109.8 - - Other 2.2 - 2.2 - - At 31 December 2007 409.4 104.6 304.8 6.48 1.9 Interest rate risk During 2006, the Group took out interest rate swaps with a notional value of 100m.
These swaps are designated cash flow hedges of the floating rate acquisition funding drawn down in 2006 and result in an interest payment or receipt as above based on the differential between the floating rate of the acquisition funding UK Sterling LIBOR plus margin and the fixing rate of 5.19% plus margin.
The swaps expire on 31 January 2010.
As at 31 December 2008, aside from the elements of the Groups debt not left fixed as a result of the swaps described above, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2008, the Groups fixed rate debt was at a weighted average rate of 5.99% 2007: 6.48%.
The Groups floating rate liabilities are predominantly based on LIBOR and its overseas equivalents.
Fair values The table on the following page details a comparison of the book and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
Where there are no readily available market values to determine fair values, cash flows relating to the various instruments have been discounted at prevailing interest and exchange rates to give an estimate of fair value.

Accordingly, the fair value of cash deposits and short term borrowings approximates to the book value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
The same applies to trade and other receivables and payables excluded from the above analysis.
As noted in the accounting policies note on page 49, the Groups management of its currency risk includes the use of forward foreign currency contracts.
The fair value of the contracts in place at 31 December 2008 was 0.1m 2007: nil.
Borrowing facilities As at 31 December 2008, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 53.1m 2007: 24.4m expiring in more than two years, and 7.6m 2007: 15.0m expiring within one year.
In addition the Group had other undrawn facilities of 39.8m 2007: 59.7m available.

Restructuring provisions relate to the ongoing plans to integrate the acquired Uniqema business with the existing Croda businesses.
Other provisions relate primarily to onerous contracts within the acquired Uniqema business.
Provisions are made where a constructive or legal obligation can be quantified and where the timing of the transfer of economic benefits relating to the provisions cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty.
During 2008, the Group successfully re-negotiated one of the onerous contracts within the acquired Uniqema business, resulting in a credit to the income statement of 9.1m.
In addition a further charge to the income statement of 9.1m was made in respect of the continued restructuring of the business following the Uniqema acquisition.
In relation to the environmental and other provisions, the directors consider that the balance will be utilised within 20 years.
With regard to the restructuring provision, significant utilisation has occurred in 2008 and the directors view is that there will be further significant elements, notably in respect of employee costs, that will be utilised in 2009 and that the balance will be largely utilised by 2011.
Based on information currently available and on the detailed plans established for the restructuring of the Group, this level of provision is considered appropriate by the directors.
Other provisions introduced following finalisation of the fair value exercise relate to the fair value adjustments in respect of onerous contracts and fixed asset decommissioning.
These provisions will be largely utilised by 2011.
The Group has considered the impact of discounting on its provisions and has concluded that, as a consequence of the significant utilisation expected in a relatively short timescale, the impact is immaterial.
Non cash utilisation of the restructuring provision relates to the write down of fixed and current assets required as a result of restructuring activity.

Share based payments continued The key elements of each scheme along with the assumptions employed to arrive at the charge in the income statement are set out below.
Croda Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The SAYE scheme, established in 1983, grants options annually in September to employees of the Group at a fixed exercise price, being the market price of the Companys shares at the grant date discounted by up to 20%.
Employees then enter into a savings contract over 3 to 5 years and, subject to continued employment, purchase options at the end of the period based on the amount saved.
Options are then exercisable for a 6 month period following completion of the savings contract.
As the option is equity settled, under IFRS 2 charges are only made in respect of options granted after 7 November 2002.
For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows: Grant date 2008 Share price at grant date 636p Exercise price 509p Number of employees 365 Shares under option 174,232 Vesting period 3 years Expected volatility 30% Option life 6 months Expected life - Risk free rate 4.3% Dividend yield 2.8% Possibility of forfeiture 7.5% pa Fair value per option at grant date 173p A reconciliation of option movements over the period is as follows: 2008 2007 Weighted Weighted average average exercise exercise Number price p Number price p Outstanding at 1 January 942,756 364 964,255 250 Granted 174,232 509 319,241 520 Forfeited 40,365 448 47,642 308 Exercised 157,146 227 293,098 197 Outstanding at 31 December 919,477 411 942,756 364 Exercisable at 31 December 13,146 18,593 For options exercised in year, weighted average share price at date of exercise 521 616 Weighted average remaining life at 31 December years 2.2 2.6 Croda International Overseas Sharesave Scheme International The International scheme, established in 1999, has the same option pricing model, savings contract and vesting period as the SAYE scheme.
At exercise, employees are paid a cash equivalent for each option purchased, being the difference between the exercise price and market price at the exercise date.
As the scheme is cash settled, IFRS 2 applies to all options in existence during the year, regardless of grant date.
For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows: Grant date 2008 Share price at grant date 636p Exercise price 509p Number of employees 584 Shares under option 285,248 Vesting period 3 years Expected volatility 40% Option life 1 month Expected life - Risk free rate 1.4% Dividend yield 3.3% Possibility of forfeiture 7.5% pa Fair value per option at 31 December 121p 69 Notes to the Group accounts 23.

The performance conditions are discussed in detail in the directors remuneration report page 27.
As with the SAYE scheme, the Executive Scheme is equity settled and as a consequence only the options granted in 2003 fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
No further options will be granted under this scheme.

Under the SIP scheme, employees enter into an agreement to purchase shares in the Company each month.
For each share purchased by an employee, the Company awards a matching share which passes to the employee after 3 years service.
The matching shares are allocated each month at market value with this fair value charge being recognised in the income statement in full in the year of allocation.
Preference share capital 2008 2007 000 000 The authorised, issued and fully paid preference share capital comprises 5.9% preference shares of 1 616 616 6.6% preference shares of 1 499 499 7.5% preference shares of 1 22 22 1,137 1,137 The preference shares have no redemption rights and carry no voting rights other than in certain circumstances affecting the rights of the preference shareholders, details of which are set out in the Companys Articles of Association.
The three classes of preference shares rank pari passu with each other but ahead of the ordinary shares on winding up.
Rights on a winding up are limited to repayment of capital and any arrears of dividends.
