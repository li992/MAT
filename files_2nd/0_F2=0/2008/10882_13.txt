A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2008 Budget Statement and are expected to be enacted in the 2008 Finance Act.
These include changes to the industrial buildings allowance regime.
The changes have not been substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date and are therefore not included in these financial statements.
However, changes to the industrial buildings allowance regime are expected to have a 9m tax charge impact.

The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2008 was 69m 2007: 70m.
The anticipated timing of the cash flows for statutory decontamination cannot be predicted with certainty, but they are expected to be incurred over the next 50 years.
There are a number of uncertainties that affect the calculation of the provision for gas site decontamination, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
National Grid Gas has made its best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties in the calculation of the provision, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.

Provisions continued Restructuring provision At 31 March 2008, 6m of the total restructuring provision 2007: 7m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties.

The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs, largely to be paid within the next financial year.
Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2008 include 18m 2007: 17m in respect of employer liability claims.
