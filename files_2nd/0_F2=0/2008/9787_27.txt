These provisions are reviewed regularly and updated to reflect managements latest best estimates, however, actual returns and redemptions could vary from these estimates.
Non-GAAP performance measures The directors believe that the adjusted profit and earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on the underlying performance of the business.
These measures are consistent with how business performance is measured internally.
The adjusted profit before tax measure is not a recognised profit measure under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures used by other companies.
The adjustments made to reported profit before tax are to exclude the following: exceptional income and charges These are largely one-off in nature and therefore create significant volatility in reported earnings: and profits and losses on the disposal of properties These can vary significantly from year to year, again creating volatility i n reported earnings.
2 Segmental information The Groups primary reporting segments are geographic, with the Group operating in two geographic areas being the UK and International.
The International segment consists of the Marks & Spencer owned businesses in the Republic of Ireland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Greece, a number of other Balkan states, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania, together with franchised operations.
The geographic segments disclose revenue, operating profit and segment assets and liabilities by destination and reflect management responsibility.
Within each geographic segment the Group sells both food and general merchandise and secondary segment disclosure is given for revenue.
Given that both food and general merchandise are sold from the same locations it is not practical to provide segmental information on operating assets and capital expenditure at this level.
To the extent that members have chosen the option to limit their future pensionable salary increases to inflation there is a past service credit to reflect the impact of adjusting their projected final pensionable salaries.
2 Owned stores consist of the Marks & Spencer owned businesses in the Republic of Ireland, Hong Kong, Taiwan and, since 29 February 2008, Greece, a number of other Balkan states and Switzerland, and since 20 March 2008, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania, which were included in franchised stores up to that date see note 25.
3 Non-operating assets and liabilities include balances in respect of financing and taxation.
Revenue originates in the following geographical segments: United Kingdom 8,595.3m last year 8,218.6m and International 426.7m last year 369.5m.
The value of goods exported from the UK, including shipments to international subsidiaries, amounted to 499.7m last year 438.0m.
Included within UK Retail is an operating profit of 28.3m last year 19.5m in respect of fees received from HSBC in relation to M&S Money.

The adjusted earnings per share figures have also been calculated based on earnings excluding the effect of property disposals and exceptional items.
These have been calculated to allow the shareholders to gain an understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has only one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

Further details of the pension scheme can be found on page 34.
The defined benefit section operates on a final salary basis and at the year end had some 24,000 active members last year 27,000, 58,000 deferred members last year 57,000 and 39,000 pensioners last year 37,000.
At the year end, the defined contribution section had some 8,000 active members last year 7,000 and some 1,000 deferred members last year 1,000.
The Group also operates a small funded defined benefit pension scheme in the Republic of Ireland.
Retirement benefits also include a UK post-retirement healthcare scheme and unfunded retirement benefits.
Within the total Group retirement benefit cost of 44.2m, excluding the exceptional pension credit, last year 91.1m 28.0m last year 78.0m relates to the UK defined benefit section, 11.7m last year 8.6m to the UK defined contribution section and 4.5m last year 4.5m to other retirement benefit schemes.

The financial assumptions for the UK scheme and the most recent actuarial valuations of the other post-retirement schemes have been updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Retirement Benefits and IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes.

If the discount rate increased decreased by 0.1% the IAS 19 surplus would increase decrease by c. 100m.
C Demographic assumptions The demographic assumptions are in line with those adopted for the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme.
One of the most significant demographic assumptions underlying the valuation is mortality.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on an analysis of the pensioner mortality trends under the scheme for the period to March 2006 updated to allow for anticipated longevity improvements over the subsequent year.
The specific mortality rates used are based on the PMA92 and PFA92 tables, adjusted to allow for the experience of scheme pensioners.
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: 2008 2007 years years Current pensioners at age 65 males 21.0 21.0 females 23.5 23.5 Future pensioners at age 65 males 21.9 21.9 females 24.3 24.3 Key performance Shareholder About us indicators Business review Governance information Financial review Financial statements marksandspencer.

Further details of the option and share schemes that the Group operates are provided in the Remuneration report on pages 48 to 55.
A Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the scheme, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into an HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
HMRC rules limit the maximum amount saved to 250 per month.
The price at which options may be offered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the offer date.
The options may normally be exercised during the period of six months after the completion of the SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the scheme.

The Plan allows employees to invest a proportion of their bonus in shares of the Company.
These investment shares must be held by the participant for three years, during which time they will receive dividends.
At the end of the three-year holding period, if the participant is still in employment with the Company, and still holds the investment shares, they will receive one matching share for every four that they bought.

Goodwill is not amortised, but tested annually for impairment with the recoverable amount being determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and changes in income and costs.
The Group prepares discounted cash flow forecasts based on financial forecasts approved by management covering a three-year period, which takes account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments.
Cash flows beyond this three-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.0%, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the Groups retail businesses.
Management estimates the discount rate using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to retail businesses.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9.5% has been used.
Brands consist of the per una brand which is being amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.

4 Interest on these bonds is payable semi-annually.
5 These notes include an investor put and issuer call option exercisable in December 2012.
During the year the Group issued new bonds totalling 638m in both the US$ and sterling debt capital markets.
On 6 December 2007 the Group issued under rule 144A of the U. S. Securities Act US$500m of notes out to 2017 and US$300m of notes out to 2037 at fixed rates of 6.250% and 7.125% respectively.
These notes have been swapped back into sterling proceeds and pay fixed sterling rates of 7.034% and 7.238% respectively.
These cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges in relation to the US$ notes.
In addition on 13 December 2007 the Group issued 250m of puttable callable reset notes at a coupon rate of 6.875%.
The Groups right of call within these notes can be assigned which provides a discount of 0.75% per annum until December 2012, giving a net interest rate for the first five years of 6.125%.
If called at that date, these notes will continue to exist until December 2037 at an underlying rate of 4.54% plus the applicable credit spread at that time.
At year end, the Group had a committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of 1.2bn set to mature on 26 March 2013.
This facility contains only one financial covenant being the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rents payable to interest plus rents payable.
In addition the Group entered into a 400m credit agreement set to expire on 13 February 2009 with an option to term out for a further year.
This facility has the same financial covenant as the main 1.2bn facility.
The Group also has a number of undrawn uncommitted facilities available to it.
At year end, these amounted to 155m last year 155m, all of which are due to be reviewed within a year.
At the balance sheet date a sterling equivalent of 615m last year 297m was drawn under the committed facilities and a further 29m last year 19m was drawn under the uncommitted facilities.
Finance leases The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as shown in the table opposite.
It is the Groups policy to lease certain of its properties and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term for equipment is five years and 125 years for property.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract rate.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent payments.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
com annualreport08 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC 81 21 Borrowings and other financial liabilities continued Partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme The partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme of 723.2m last year 496.9m relates to the amortising liability in respect of the obligations of the Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme.
Last year the Group agreed a plan with the Pension Scheme Trustee to address the majority of the deficit by transferring properties with a current market value of 1.1bn into a partnership established by the Group.
A limited interest in this partnership was contributed to the pension scheme on 13 March 2007.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
The properties held in the partnership have been leased back to Marks and Spencer plc.
The pension scheme is entitled to a distribution from the profits of the partnership of 50m per annum for 15 years from July 2008.
The Group has the right to buy out the Trustees partnership interest at any point for an amount equal to the net present value of the remaining annual distributions due to the pension scheme.
This year the Group has agreed to pre-fund 200.0m of its annual contribution to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme for the next three years by increasing the value of the Schemes interest in the property partnership.
To meet this 200.0m contribution of value, the Group has placed additional properties into the partnership with a current market value of approximately 400.0m.
These properties have been leased back to Marks and Spencer plc and the fixed annual distribution made out of partnership profits to the pension scheme will be increased by approximately 21.9m for the remaining 14 year period.
Each year the total obligation will reduce as payments are made to the pension scheme by the partnership and an interest charge will be taken to the income statement representing the unwinding of the discounted obligation at an implied average interest rate of 5.7% last year 5.3%.
The fair value of this liability was 706.6m last year 495.3m.
82 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Borrowings and other financial liabilities continued Financial liabilities After taking into account the hedging derivatives entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups financial liabilities is as set out below excluding short-term payables and the COMS a. s. put option: 2008 2007 Fixed Floating Fixed Floating rate rate Total rate rate Total m m m m m m Currency Sterling 2,665.9 673.0 3,338.9 1,735.8 289.7 2,025.5 Euro 192.5 192.5 159.5 159.5 Hong Kong dollar 6.9 6.9 7.4 7.4 2,665.9 872.4 3,538.3 1,735.8 456.6 2,192.4 The floating rate sterling and euro borrowings are linked to interest rates related to LIBOR.
These rates are for periods between one and three months.
As at the balance sheet date and excluding finance leases but including the partnership liability, the fixed rate sterling borrowings are at an average rate of 6.0% last year 5.8% and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is 10 years last year 8.5 years.
Interest rate analysis The effective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2008 2007 % % Committed and uncommitted borrowings 5.5 4.8 Medium term notes 6.2 5.9 Finance leases 5.0 4.4 Partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme 5.7 5.3 22 Financial instruments Treasury policy and financial risk management The Group operates a centralised Group treasury function to manage the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board approved treasury policies and procedures, and their delegated authorities.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
Group treasury also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and financing.
It remains the Groups policy not to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, except where financial constraints necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity funding, interest rate, foreign currency and counterparty risks.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: A Liquidity funding risk The Groups funding strategy is to ensure a mix of funding sources offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are financed by a combination of retained profits, bank borrowings, medium term notes and committed syndicated bank facilities.
In addition to the existing borrowings, the Group has a Euro Medium Term Note programme of 3bn, of which 1.5bn last year 1.2bn was in issuance as at the balance sheet date.
Short-term borrowings are backed by a 1.2bn five-year committed syndicated bank facility, of which 615.0m last year 296.9m was drawn down at the balance sheet date.
com annualreport08 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC 83 22 Financial instruments continued B Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the sterling, US$, euro and Hong Kong dollar variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups policy is to use derivative contracts where necessary to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings to manage this risk.
The structure and maturity of these derivatives correspond to the underlying borrowings and are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
At the balance sheet date, fixed rate borrowings amounted to 2,665.8m last year 1,735.8m representing the public bond issues and finance leases, and amounting to 75% last year 79% of the Groups gross borrowings.
C Foreign currency risk Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of goods from the UK to overseas subsidiaries, and from the import of materials and goods directly sourced from overseas suppliers.
Group treasury hedge these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively covering up to 100% out to 18 months.
Where appropriate hedge cover can be taken out longer than 18 months with Board approval.
The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange in relation to sterling against movements in US$ and euro.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the Groups forecast currency requirements are designated as cash flow hedges with fair value movements recognised directly in equity.
To the extent that these hedges cover actual currency payables or receivables then associated fair value movements previously recognised in equity are recorded in the income statement in conjunction with the corresponding asset or liability.
As at the balance sheet date the gross notional value in sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts amounted to 619m last year 456m with a weighted average maturity date of seven months last year six months.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposures.
However, the translation exposures arising on the overseas net assets are hedged with foreign currency debt.
As at the balance sheet date, 243m last year 234m and HK$107m last year HK$113m currency debt was hedging overseas net assets.
The Group also hedges foreign currency intercompany loans where these exist.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the hedging of the Groups foreign currency intercompany loans are designated as held for trading with fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The corresponding fair value movement of the intercompany loan balance results in an overall nil impact on the income statement.
As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was 80m last year 128m.
Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 March 2008 will be released to the income statement at various dates over the following 19 months last year 14 months from the balance sheet date.
D Counterparty risk Counterparty risk exists where the Group can suffer financial loss through default or non-performance by financial institutions.
Exposures are managed through the Group treasury policy which limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The counterparties are limited to the approved institutions with secure long-term credit ratings of A A1 or better assigned by Moodys and Standard & Poors respectively.
Limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
The credit risk of these financial instruments is estimated as the fair value of the assets resulting from the contracts.
The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group does not have any material exposures to concentrations of credit risk with any one counterparty.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was as follows: trade receivables 85m last year 68m, other receivables 46m last year 53m, cash and cash equivalents 318m last year 180m and derivatives 37m last year 2m.
84 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC Notes to the financial statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued E Sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and equity as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to all of the Groups financial instruments.
The Group considers that a 1% - movement in interest rates and a 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling represents reasonable possible changes.
However, this analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates reflects the effect on the Groups floating rate debt as at the balance sheet date.
The impact in equity reflects the fair value movement in relation to the Groups cross currency swaps.
The impact from foreign exchange movements reflects the change in the fair value of the Groups transactional foreign exchange cash flow hedges and the net investment hedges at the balance sheet date.
The equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net investments.
This value is expected to be fully offset by the retranslation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net equity impact of zero.
The table excludes financial instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.
Also excluded are trade receivables and payables, and the COMS a. s. put option.

The attributes of these derivatives matched the characteristics of the underlying debt hedged.
The amounts reported as options held for trading in derivative assets and liabilities represent the fair value of the call option with the puttable callable reset notes mirrored by the fair value of the sold option to have this call assigned.
Fair value of financial instruments With the exception of the Groups fixed rate bond debt and the partnership liability see note 21, there were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Groups fixed rate bond debt was 1,859.2m last year 1,177.3m, the fair value of this debt was 1,740.7m last year 1,162.9m.
Capital policy The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure that optimises the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

The Group is claiming UK tax relief for losses incurred by some of its current and former European subsidiaries.
In the light of continuing litigation, no asset has been recognised in respect of these claims.

The Marinopoulos group, located in Greece, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Switzerland and Serbia, was previously a franchise partner of the Group and is a retailer of general merchandise and food.
The fair values currently established for the acquisition are provisional due to the proximity of the date of acquisition to the Groups reporting date.
The acquisition has contributed 4.8m to sales and a 0.4m loss to operating profit in the period since the acquisition.
If the acquisition of the Marinopoulos group had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group sales for the year would have been 9,052m and Group profits attributable to equity holders of the Company would have been 824m.
COMS a. s. On 20 March 2008, the Group acquired 51% of the issued share capital of COMS a. s. for cash consideration of 13.6m and transaction costs of 0.8m.
The COMS group, located in the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, was previously a franchise partner of the Group and is a retailer of general merchandise and food.
The acquisition has contributed nil to sales and nil to operating profit in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition of the COMS group had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group sales for the year would have been 9,034m and Group profits attributable to equity holders of the Company would have been 822m.
The sale and purchase agreement includes call and put options over the remaining 49% of the share capital of COMS a. s. exercisable in five years time.
The fair value of the put option 52.2m has been recognised as a liability at 29 March 2008 note 20 and note 27.
On an undiscounted basis this liability has a value of 81.0m.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisitions of Marks and Spencer Marinopoulos B. V. and COMS a. s. due to the opportunities to facilitate a faster rate of growth and greater operating efficiency that do not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
