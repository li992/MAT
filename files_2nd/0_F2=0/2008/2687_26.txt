The result will be a proposition thats valued by our customers and economic for us.
03 Chairmans review 2007 08 delivered further good progress, EBITDA grew by 23% and total operating profit has more than doubled.
In 2008 09 therell be more growth in EBITDA, which I expect to flow through into cash.
Im pleased with what we have achieved in 2007 08, building on last years solid foundations.
Europe, Asia & US continues to focus on the largest users of telecommunications whether at home or abroad which plays to our strengths, particularly our scale and reach.
The high quality managed services that we offer are exactly what these customers require.
Its something of a first for me to be able to say that our latest IP based product suite, supported by our next generation network, gives us a market lead thatll exist for some time.
All of this at a time when our service levels are at an all time high.
In the second half of 2007 08, Europe, Asia & US passed two important milestones it returned to revenue growth and it generated trading cash for the first time in many years.
International grew during 2007 08 but not by as much as we would have liked.
There were stunning performances from Panama and Macau.
These two businesses are thriving as truly competitive enterprises.
In 2008 09 we will see more mobile competition in Panama but weve prepared diligently and are as ready as we can be.
Elsewhere there were solid performances from the portfolio although Jamaica remains a blemish.
With a new management team in Jamaica since August 2007, performance improvements are beginning to show through but theres still some way to go.
We wanted to refocus International on the drivers of value which were doing.
We have set our strategy and approach and as a result I expect International to deliver growing numbers of customers, improving customer service, increased EBITDA and better cash flow.
Two years after we introduced two standalone business units Europe, Asia & US and International to Cable & Wireless, its clear that good progress has been made in our performance.
In 2008 09 I expect our performance to improve even further.
Financially and operationally, we are showing the necessary momentum for the Board to consider the next steps to deliver further value to shareholders.
At the interim results I indicated that Id recommend a 28% increase in the full year dividend to 7.50 pence per share subject to trading conditions.
Trading conditions continue to be fine so Im delighted to confirm that I am making that recommendation.
Finally, my congratulations go to our people because the success that Im reporting on is a real credit to every one of them.
Richard Lapthorne Chairman 04 Good progress Group Finance Directors review Our growth in operating profit reflects continuing progress in growing the business and cutting costs.
This performance is supported by a good cash position giving us the flexibility we need to invest in our businesses.
The strategy of Europe, Asia & US to focus on serving larger customers with higher margin IP services, while actively removing lower margin customers, is the main reason for the fall in Group revenue to 3,152 million.
In the second half of 2007 08, Europe, Asia & US was back in revenue growth as strength in our strategic product sets offset declines in legacy services.
Gross margin has increased to 1,609 million, predominantly driven by mobile and broadband growth in International.
As a percentage of revenue, gross margin has improved by three percentage points to 51%, with Europe, Asia & US the main driver.
The success of our cost cutting efforts can be seen in the 9% or 102 million reduction in the Groups operating costs before exceptional items, a major achievement.
This year, EBITDA has increased by over 100 million to 605 million, mainly reflecting further progress in the turnaround of Europe, Asia & US and the portfolio effect of International where strong performances in Panama and Macau offset weakness in Jamaica.
Group operating profit has more than doubled to 247 million.
Our cash position remains good at the year end with Group cash and cash equivalents of 699 million and net cash of 243 million.
This is after spending 190 million repurchasing our convertible bonds and paying 138 million in dividends to our shareholders.
We have completed our latest actuarial valuation of the main UK defined benefit scheme as at 31 March 2007.
We have applied the most up to date longevity assumptions, and following a contribution of 19 million, the scheme is fully funded on an ongoing basis.
We are proposing a final dividend of 5.00 pence per share, which together with the interim dividend of 2.50 pence per share represents a 28% increase on the 2006 07 full year dividend, following on from a 30% increase over the previous year.
The dividend was covered by earnings per share before exceptionals which are up from 4.00 pence to 7.90 pence in 2007 08.
Tony Rice Group Finance Director and Joint Group Managing Director, Central 05 Profitability International International Executive Chairmans review Were changing how we think about our business The last year has been one of real contrasts the performances Our customers of Panama and Macau were little short of spectacular.
Jamaica was a disappointment although in the second half, demand world class with new management, we saw a noticeable improvement service well make in its performance.
sure they get what Our revenue grew by 7% compared with 2006 07 and EBITDA they want grew by 3%.
Excluding Jamaica, wed have seen EBITDA growth of 12% a good result by any standard.
Our strategy of investing in the growth areas of mobile and broadband has served us well mobile customers are up by 27% and broadband by 16% and along with enterprise, our growth segments now represent 67% of our revenue.
Our approach for the future is to drive each one of our businesses to perform as a competitive enterprise, focused on the customer experience and on the value and quality of our propositions.
Well drive decision making down to the local business much closer to the customer and shrink our head office costs.
Our results for 2007 08 only hint at what we can achieve.
We have a firm foundation on which to build better businesses and deliver better performance.
After six months in this business I know we have the people, the desire and the ability to do it.
For 2008 09 I expect much improved EBITDA both in absolute terms and in the achievement of 35% EBITDA margins.
Our customers no longer accept good enough for this market, they demand world class service we will make sure they get what they want.
