The Group had no listed investments at 31 December 2008, following the disposal of its investment in Superscape Group plc during the year.
The cost and market value of Superscape at 31 December 2007 were 2,652,000 and 1,180,000 respectively.
72 ARM Holdings plc 14 Available-for-sale financial assets continued Other long-term investments Those unlisted companies in which the Group has invested are early-stage development enterprises, which are generating value for shareholders through research and development activities, and most do not currently report profits.
The directors do not consider it possible to estimate with precision the fair value of the Groups investments in these companies carrying value at 31 December 2008: 1,167,000: 2007: 3,701,000 as they are, by definition, not traded on an organised market and are unique in their activities.
However, based on recent fundraising transactions by these companies and, where possible, following review of relevant financial information prepared by the companies, the directors are of the opinion that the fair value of these investments approximates to carrying value.
Provisions have been made against other investments to reflect any impairment in value.
Included in other investments are the Groups less than 1% investment in the share capital of Palmchip Corporation a private fabless chip company based in California : a less than 1% investment in the share capital of Pixim Inc. also a private fabless chip company based in California : a 1.4% holding in Reciva Limited an internet radio company based in the UK : and a minority holding in Embest Info & Tech Co. Ltd a niche developer of embedded hardware and software based in China.
The Group also has an investment in the preference share capital of CoWare Inc. a company which develops system-on-chip software for a wide range of applications : and an investment in the preference shares of Luminary Micro Inc. a private fabless semiconductor company based in Texas which develops pioneering ARM architecture-based SoC products.
Neither investment in CoWare or Luminary confers any voting rights.
In 2007, the Group invested $5,000,000 2,534,000 in W&W Communications Inc. an unlisted US company by way of an interest-bearing convertible loan note: and a further $2,000,000 1,029,000 during 2008.
W&W was acquired in December 2008, at which time the loan notes were repaid including the accrued interest.
The exchange gain noted in the above table results from this US dollar denominated loan note.

No impairment charge was recorded as a result of this annual impairment test.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups CGUs according to business segment.
The carrying amounts of goodwill by CGU at 31 December 2008 are summarised below: Systems Processor Physical IP Design Division Division Division Group 000 000 000 000 Goodwill relating to Artisan 130,115 407,940 538,055 Goodwill relating to Falanx 9,400 9,400 Goodwill relating to Axys 8,308 8,308 Goodwill relating to KEG and KSI 7,916 7,916 Goodwill relating to Logipard 2,074 2,074 Goodwill relating to other acquisitions 2,060 31 2,091 Goodwill at 31 December 2008 143,649 407,940 16,255 567,844 Goodwill at 31 December 2007 107,265 302,050 11,520 420,835 The recoverable amount for each CGU has been measured based on a value in use calculation.
Processor Division PD The Processor Division encompasses those resources that are centred around microprocessor cores, including specific functions such as graphics IP, fabric IP, embedded software IP and configurable digital signal processing DSP IP.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were: Period over which the directors have projected cash flows A ten-year forecast period is used with an assumed terminal growth rate after 2018 of 3% per annum.
It is considered appropriate to use a ten-year forecast period to properly reflect the period over which the benefits of the acquisition of Artisan to the Processor Division are expected to accrue.
Forecast revenue growth Revenue is forecast to grow by an amount consistent with the Groups five-year plan as well as analysts expectations.
These have proved to be reliable guides in the past and the directors believe that these estimates are appropriate.
Revenue attributable to the benefits afforded by owning the PIPD unit The directors believe that revenue will accrue to the Processor Division as a result of the ownership of the Physical IP Division for the following reasons: The development of faster and more power-efficient microprocessors as a result of collaboration between PD and PIPD engineering teams.
This is expected to generate more PD licensing deals at higher prices: The potential for PD to win more microprocessor licensing business as a result of ARM being able to offer both processor and physical IP in-house: and The improvement in PD operating margins as a result of being able to transfer a number of engineering tasks to the Bangalore design centre acquired with Artisan.
ARM Holdings plc 75 Notes to the financial statements continued 16 Goodwill continued Operating margins Operating margins have been assumed to remain consistent with current operating margins over the period of the calculation.
Discount rate Future cash flows are discounted in line with ARMs estimated weighted average cost of capital of approximately 10% pre-tax.
The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill allocated to the Processor Division is appropriate and that the assumptions used in estimating its fair value are appropriate.
Whilst it is conceivable that a key assumption in the calculation could change, the directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value.
Physical IP Division PIPD The Physical IP Division is concerned with the building blocks necessary for translation of a circuit design into actual silicon.
It is considered appropriate to use a ten-year forecast period to properly reflect the period over which the benefits of the acquisition of Artisan are expected to accrue.
It is expected that it will take between four and seven years from acquisition before a meaningful proportion of ARMs larger semiconductor Partners are licensing some of their physical IP technology needs from the Group, with royalties being generated from these licences a further two to four years later, i. e. a total period of six to 11 years.
Further, the Groups experience in PD indicates that the base of licences grows gradually over time as licensees outsource an increasing proportion of their physical IP needs, with royalties, which are a function of the cumulative licensing base, increasing accordingly.
Forecast revenue growth Although revenue growth is not forecast in 2009 due to the current global macroeconomic environment, thereafter revenue is expected to grow by approximately 18% per annum on average for the next five years, falling to 8% per annum by 2018, reflecting the uncertainty of forecasting revenues in the years further in the future.
In assessing the appropriate valuation of Artisan in 2004, the directors assumed revenue growth of approximately 20% per annum was achievable in the Artisan stand-alone business based on process geometry shrinks bringing more licensing opportunities across a broader range of foundries and based on the significant increase in the usage of Artisan IP in 2003 and 2004 which is now contributing to royalty growth.
Licence revenues decreased by 18% year-on-year in 2008, with the order backlog at the end of the year being approximately 9% down on the level at the beginning of the year.
During 2008, a significant proportion of engineering resource was deployed to accelerate the development of leading-edge physical IP technology rather than working on the conversion of order backlog into short-term revenue.
This acceleration was seen as fundamental to the long-term growth potential of PIPD.
During 2008, the initial licences of the leading-edge technology have been signed.
The revenue from these licences will be recognised in 2009.
The directors believe that the investment in the technology portfolio will not only bring growth in future years to PIPD but also contribute significantly to the success of PD as the synergistic benefits of the combined technologies begin to accrue.
Therefore the directors have confidence that the overall forecast growth rate attributable to PIPD is achievable.
Operating margins Operating margins are assumed to increase gradually over time towards 40% by the end of the forecast period.
In 2008, PIPDs operating margin as a standalone business was estimated at a loss of 3%, reflecting additional R&D investment in order to accelerate the development of leading edge products.
Margins are expected to improve significantly in future years as licence revenues from leading edge products gather pace and royalties increase at effectively 100% margins.
Costs are expected to grow broadly in line with licence revenue growth.
This timescale is consistent with ARMs experience in developing the processor licensing and royalty model.
ARM has signed nearly 600 processor licences over the last 18 years with less than half of these yielding royalties thus far.
As royalty revenues are a function of cumulative licensing, royalty growth gathers momentum as the licensing base grows ARM processor royalties have increased from $38 million in 2002 to $227 million in 2008.
76 ARM Holdings plc 16 Goodwill continued Discount rate Future cash flows are discounted in line with ARMs estimated weighted average cost of capital of approximately 10% pre-tax.
The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill allocated to PIPD and the assumptions used in estimating its fair value are appropriate.
The overall assessment is most sensitive to any change in the forecast revenues.
Although an overall compound annual growth rate of 12% is anticipated by the directors in reaching their conclusions, an annual growth rate of just 9% would still support the carrying value of goodwill within the division.
Systems Design Division SDD The Systems Design Division is concerned with the tools and models used to create and debug software and system-onchip SoC designs.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were: Period over which the directors have projected cash flows A five-year forecast period is used with an assumed terminal growth rate after 2013 of 3% per annum.
It is considered appropriate to use a five-year forecast period to properly reflect the weighted average period over which the benefits of the acquisitions of Axys, KEG and KSI are expected to accrue.
Operating margins Operating margins are assumed to grow by an amount consistent with the Groups five-year plan.
The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill allocated to SDD and the assumptions used in estimating its fair value are appropriate.
