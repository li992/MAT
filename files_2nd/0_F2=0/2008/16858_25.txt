The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 114 to 118.
VT Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The accounting policies as set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements and have been applied consistently by Group companies.
The Groups results for the year have not been materially affected by the adoption of any new accounting standards.
2  i Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis as modified for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are stated in m except when otherwise indicated.
In accordance with IFRS 3 the Group has reassessed the provisional fair values and purchase consideration in respect of the acquisition of Milcom Systems Corporation made in the prior financial year.
As a result of this reassessment goodwill arising from the transaction has been increased by 5.2m from that previously assessed.
In addition, trade and other receivables were increased by 0.1m, deferred tax assets increased by 0.5m, trade and other payables increased by 3.5m including additional consideration of 2.5m, provisions increased by 1.8m and taxation receivable decreased by 0.5m.
There was no effect on the reported profit for the prior year.
The restated amounts are presented in the balance sheet at 31 March 2007. ii Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of VT Group plc and its subsidiaries at each balance sheet date, and include its share of its joint ventures and associates results on the equity method.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the year are consolidated up to, or from, the date control passes.
iii Investments in associates and joint ventures Joint ventures are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise joint control with its partners under a contractual agreement.
Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The Groups share of post tax results of joint ventures and associates are included in the consolidated income statement as an element of profit before tax.
In the consolidated balance sheet the net investment in joint ventures and associates is carried as a non-current asset being the share of the joint ventures or associates equity including any goodwill arising on the Groups acquisition of its interest.
iv Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Saleofgoods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and can be reliably measured and recovery of consideration is considered probable.
Renderingofservices Revenue from services rendered is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction.
Revenue from services provided on a short-term or one-off basis is recognised when the service is complete.
The provision of services over a long-term period are accounted for under the principles of construction contracts, and the revenue recognised as set out below.
 Revenue from construction contracts, including long-term service provision contracts, is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion is determined according to the nature of the specific contract concerned.
Methods used to assess the stage of completion include incurred costs as a proportion of total costs, labour hours incurred or earned value of work performed.
Profit attributable to the contract activity is recognised if the final outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
VT Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 71 2 Summaryofsignifi  continued Variations and claims are included where it is probable that the amount will be settled.
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable that those costs will be recoverable.
The Group presents as an asset the gross amount due from customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which costs incurred plus recognised profi ts less recognised losses exceed progress billings.
Progress billings not yet paid by customers and retentions are included within trade and other receivables.
The Group presents as a liability the gross amount due to customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profi ts less recognised losses.
 Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases.
v Leases Finance leases, which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concerned, are capitalised on the balance sheet at the lower of fair value of the leased asset and net present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liabilities are recorded as non-current or current liabilities depending on the period when they are due.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases as a fi finance cost.
Lease payments are apportioned between the fi finance cost and the reduction in the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the period of the relevant committed lease period.
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and investment property at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
vi Income tax Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for fi financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not recognised for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting or taxable profi t, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profi ts will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefi t will be realised.
vii Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated as cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Computer equipment 3 to 5 years Fixtures and fi ttings 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Plant and machinery 5 to 10 years Heavy equipment 20 to 33 years Statutory Information VT Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 72 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2  continued Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
The residual value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reassessed annually and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
viii Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits and can be measured reliably.
Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
ix Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation consists of the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible assets net of the fair value of the liabilities including contingencies of businesses acquired at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill in respect of business combinations of subsidiaries is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture or associated undertaking is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses that arise from annual assessment of its carrying value.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, goodwill is written down and an impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the estimated value in use.
Value in use is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Between 1998 and the Groups conversion to IFRS, goodwill was accounted for in accordance with UK GAAP.
x Research costs Research costs are expensed as incurred.
xi Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business combination are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets, excluding development costs, created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Computer software 2-5 years Brands 3-5 years Customer contracts and relationships up to 30 years Useful lives are examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable are made on a prospective basis.
xii Investment properties Land and buildings that are leased to non-Group entities are classified as investment properties.
The Group applies the cost model to measure investment properties at their cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of investment properties over their estimated useful lives of up to 50 years.
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
xiii Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are tested for impairment when events occur or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may be impaired.
Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests.
Impairments arising are charged to the income statement.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
VT Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 73 2 Summaryofsignifi  continued An assets recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash fl ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash fl ows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
xiv Other investments The Group determines the classifi cation of its other investments at initial recognition.
The classifi cation depends upon the purpose for which the investments were acquired.
Currently the Group has other investments designated as held-to-maturity and loans and receivables.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all fi financial assets not carried at fair value through profi t and loss.
Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash fl ows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risk and rewards of ownership.
xv Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the fi first-in-fi first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
xvi Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identifi ed.
Other receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment losses.
xvii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash fl ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defi ned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts repayable on demand.
xviii Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currency of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Sterling at average rates of exchange during the year.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences that arose before the transition date to IFRSs were deemed to be nil.
xix Derivative fi financial instruments The Group primarily uses foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fl uctuations.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative fi financial statements for trading purposes.
Derivative fi financial instruments are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profi les.
Statutory Information VT Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 74 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2  continued For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
The Group currently only has designated cash flow hedges.
In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge firm commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting such as a known foreign currency receipt or payment and a known interest payment, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the profit or loss.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising in fair value are taken directly to profit or loss for the year.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss for the year.
xx Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being the amount of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
The Group has certain borrowings relating to PFI contracts where there is no recourse to the Group in the event of default.
Such loans, although recognised in full on the Groups balance sheet, are classified as non-recourse loans within the analysis on net debt provided.
xxi Retirement benefit plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and any unrecognised past service costs, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculations, together with the cost of providing benefits under the plans, are performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
xxii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
xxiii Share-based payment transactions Share based incentive arrangements are provided to employees under the Groups share option, incentive and other award schemes.
Share options granted to employees and share based arrangements put in place since 7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or award using an appropriate option pricing model and are charged to operating profit over the vesting period of the scheme, with a corresponding entry recorded within equity.
The annual charge is modified to take account of shares forfeited by employees who leave during the vesting period and, in the case of non-market related performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely the option will vest.
The Group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
xxiv Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate.
VT Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 75 2 Summaryofsignifi  continued Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when it becomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total contract revenues.
Such provisions are recorded as write downs of work in progress for that portion of the work which has already been completed, and as liability provisions for the remainder.
Losses are determined on the basis of estimated results on completion of contracts which are updated regularly.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products and services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Provisions for restructuring or reorganisation are recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefi ts to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligation under the contract.
xxv Accounting for PFI contracts In determining an appropriate accounting policy for the Groups interests in PFI projects under Adopted IFRSs, the Group has considered the current status of the project by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC on accounting for service concession arrangements.
IFRIC published IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements in December 2006 which is applicable for accounting periods commencing after 1 January 2008.
The Group has opted not to adopt this pronouncement early and until such time as this pronouncement is adopted, it will continue to apply elements of the approach set out in UK Financial Reporting Standard 5 Reporting the substance of transactions in accounting for its interests in PFI projects.
This involves applying a risks and rewards test to determine whether a non-current asset or fi finance debtor model should be followed.
Once the accounting model has been determined, the recognised assets and liabilities of the PFI projects are measured in accordance with Adopted IFRS.
The Group will be adopting IFRIC 12 subject to EU endorsement for the year commencing 1 April 2008 as outlined below.
The Group expenses costs incurred in developing and competing for contracts up until a contract has achieved preferred bidder stage.
Costs incurred after preferred bidder status has been achieved are held on the balance sheet and recovered through contract activity.
Such costs are subject to review for impairment if there are indicators that they may not be recoverable.
xxvi Assets held for sale Non-current assets are classifi ed as held for sale when their carrying value will be recovered through disposal rather than continuing use within the business, the asset is available for sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable.
Following reclassifi cation, non-current assets are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount and fair values less costs to sell.
xxvii Critical accounting estimates and judgements An analysis and explanation of the accounting estimates and judgements used in producing this set of fi financial statements is made in the Business Review on pages 3 to 36. xxviii New standards and interpretations With effect from 1 April 2007, the Group adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the amendment to IAS 1: Capital Disclosures which have resulted in some additional disclosures within the fi financial statements, but have had no impact on the Groups primary statements.
 A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective, including: IFRS 8 Operating Segments relating to segmental reporting of fi financial information.
It is not expected to have a signifi cant impact on the Groups current segmental reporting.
The amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs removes the option to expense borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets.
The Group already complies with the requirements.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements will require the Group to assess all Service Concession Arrangements and may result in the recognition and derecognition of certain assets and reclassifi cation of income earned on some contracts.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of this interpretation.
IFRIC 14 1AS 19 The Limit on a Defi ned Benefi t Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction clarifi es when refunds or reductions in future contributions in relation to defi ned benefi t assets should be regarded as available and provides guidance on the impact of the minimum funding requirements on such assets.
The Group has yet to assess the potential impact of IFRIC 14.
IFRIC 12, IFRIC 14 and the amendment to IAS 23 have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The Group has not early adopted the above standards in preparing these fi financial statements.

Goodwill of 10.3m was recognised at 31 March 2007 based on provisional fair values.
The fair values and acquisition consideration have been fi nalised since 31 March 2007 and in accordance with IFRS 3, an increase to goodwill of 5.2m has been made as outlined in note 2 to the fi financial statements.
The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash fl ow projections based on fi financial budgets approved by the board.
The discount rate applied to cash fl ow projections is 10%-13% and cash fl ow projections beyond the three year budget are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate 2007: 2.5%.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following key assumptions: Gross margin Discount rates Growth rate used to extrapolate cash fl ows beyond the budget period Gross margins are based on the current values being achieved.
Discount rates refl ect the Companys weighted average cost of capital.
Growth rate estimates are based on published information in respect of long-term growth rates.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

The fair value of financial instruments have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date.
Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
For interest rate swaps broker quotes are used.
Those quotes are back tested using pricing models or discounted cash flow techniques.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest-bearing loans and borrowings is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.

Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions and to acquire interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk.
Currency risk The Group has significant investment in overseas operations, predominantly in the USA.
As a result the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce where possible both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk.
Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Groups overseas net assets.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures which arise when sales and purchases are made in currencies other than its own functional currency.
The Group actively manages and mitigates this exposure through matching non functional currency revenues with non functional currency costs and through the use of forward contracts.
Currency exposures are reviewed regularly by the Group treasury function.
The major currency in which the Group trades in overseas operations is the US dollar.
A 10% movement in the US dollar: sterling exchange rate from the year average rate of 2.0133 would have changed the reported Group profit after taxation by 0.2m.
Uncommitted borrowing facilities At 31 March 2008 the Group had available 160m 2007: 170.1m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
80m of these facilities fall for review in September 2009, and the remainder is available until November 2011.

All plans are equity-settled except for an element of the Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme.
New awards are no longer made under the long-term incentive or share option plans.
Long-term incentive plan LTIP The long-term incentive plan was established as an incentive scheme for executive directors and other selected senior executives.
Under the terms of the scheme, employees may be awarded shares equal in value up to 50% of basic salary.
The grant of awards is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The shares are held in trust and released after three years pro rata to achievement of the performance target.
The performance criteria is the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the comparator group which currently comprises the members of the FTSE250 but excluding Investment Trusts but for future years the remuneration committee has the discretion in addition to relate the TSR to the Defence sector or the Support services sector.
Shares vest fully if the Companys performance equals the upper quartile of the comparator group but there is no vesting if performance is below the median.
For LTIP awards made prior to July 2005, each time share awards were made under the LTIP employees were entitled to invest, subject to certain conditions, up to 5% of basic salary to purchase additional shares in the Company Retained Shares.

Deferred annual bonus scheme DABS The Group operates a deferred annual bonus scheme for senior executives.
Under the provisions of the scheme members are required to defer 40% of their annual bonus which is used to acquire shares to that value.
In addition, employees have the option to defer a further portion of annual bonus to acquire additional shares, up to a maximum of a further 35% of annual bonus.
The deferred shares are held in trust for a period of three years.
At the end of the three year period employees will receive these shares together with a matching element from the Company.
The quantum of the matching element is dependant upon earnings per share growth targets.
The maximum matching element obtainable is three times the deferred shares originally held for an employee.
Share option plans The Group operates two share option plans under which directors and other executives are eligible to participate at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Options are granted at market value, determined immediately before the grant.
Share options vest in equal tranches on the 3rd, 4th and 5th anniversaries of the date of the grant subject to achievement of a performance condition.
The performance condition currently applying is real growth in earnings per share of at least 2% per annum over three consecutive years.
These share options have a maximum life of 10 years.
Share incentive plan SIP The Group operates a share incentive plan open to all employees.
Under this plan employees are granted share options subject to the Group meeting certain fi financial profi t targets.
Options are granted at the market value on date of the award and vest unconditionally if the employee remains in service for a period of 3 years from the date of the award.
The contractual life of the options is fi five years and there are no cash settlement alternatives.

Under this scheme certain employees are granted nil cost options which vest after a three year performance period, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and continued employment.
Awards are subject to two performance conditions being either the Groups earnings per share growth or the relative total shareholder return.
Employee Share Option Savings Plans ESOP The Group operates Share Option Savings Plans for all eligible employees, whereby employees can save towards the exercise price payable for an award of share options.
The exercise price of these options is set at 90% of the market value of the share price at the date of grant.
Under awards granted by the Group, the savings period is ether 3 or 5 years for UK based employees and 2 years for US based employees.
At the end of the savings period, the options vest and the option holders have a 6 month window in which to exercise their options.

The weighted average assumptions used in determining fair value of options granted were as follows: PSP Long-term incentive plan Share options plans Share options savings plans 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Dividend yield - - - 2.2% - 2.3% - 2.4% Expected volatility 21.1% - - 21.0% - 22.6% - 21.2% Risk-free interest rate 5.2% - - 4.7% - 4.7% - 4.7% Expected life 3years - - 3 years - 5 years - 4 years Exercise price - - 484p - 465p - 415p Statutory Information VT Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 106 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued  continued The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options.
The expected life of the options is the Companys best estimate of exercise patterns based on current available data.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan includes a market vesting condition linked to the Total Shareholder Return TSR of a comparator group which requires the volatility of comparator companies share prices and the average correlation between the share prices of the Company and the comparator companies to be considered in assessing the fair value of options granted.
The following approach has been adopted for these items: Comparator company volatility Annualised, daily historic volatility assessed over a period prior to the date of grant that corresponds to the period over which the TSR is being projected: Company correlation Taken as the average correlation of TSR between all of the companies over the same historic period Compensation expense 2008 2007 m m Long-term incentive plan 0.4 0.5 Deferred annual bonus scheme 2.7 2.0 Share option plans 0.4 0.3 PSP 0.4 - Share incentive plan 0.7 0.3 Employee share option savings plans 0.4 0.4 5.0 3.5 The portion of the above expense arising from equity settled share-based payment transactions is 4.1m 2007: 2.7m.

 As at 31 March 2008, the parent company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business entered into for, or on behalf of, certain Group and joint venture undertakings.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the Group consolidated financial statements or within those of the relevant subsidiary.
As the conditions of the above guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no contingent liability exists at the year end.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
VT Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 109 36Retirementbenefi ts The Group participates in fi five defi ned benefi t pension schemes: the Shipbuilding Industries Scheme SIPS, four education related schemes: LAWDC, the Guidance Enterprise Group Scheme, the Local Government Pension Scheme LGPS, and a US scheme.
The UK schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered funds.
The US scheme is an unfunded scheme.
The Group holds a life assurance policy which is to be used to fund retirement benefi ts arising.
Under IAS 19 this insurance policy is deemed to be a non-qualifying insurance policy and as such is not an asset of the pension scheme.
The asset is instead a corporate-owned asset and is included within fi financial assets on the balance sheet note 19.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualifi ed actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published forecasts to each category of scheme assets.
The assets and liabilities of the schemes at 31 March are: Year ended 31 March 2008 SIPS US Other Total m m m m Scheme assets at fair value Equities 251.7 - 37.7 289.4 Bonds 32.7 - 8.4 41.1 Other 11.7 - 4.5 16.2 Fair value of scheme assets 296.1 - 50.6 346.7 Present value of scheme obligations 305.5 0.2 50.7 356.4 Net pension liability 9.4 0.2 0.1 9.7 Year ended 31 March 2007 SIPS US Other Total m m m m Scheme assets at fair value Equities 230.8 - 42.5 273.3 Bonds 21.5 - 5.7 27.2 Other 53.4 - 2.8 56.2 Fair value of scheme assets 305.7 - 51.0 356.7 Present value of scheme obligations 338.8 0.1 55.4 394.3 Net pension liability 33.1 0.1 4.4 37.6 The pension plans have not directly invested in any of the Groups own fi financial instruments nor in properties or other assets used by the Group.

For the main SIPS scheme the actuarial table used is PA 92, which allows for expected increases in longevity.
The table has been adjusted for deferred members and pensioners to reflect actual scheme experience.
In addition the mortality assumption includes a short cohort effect 2007: medium cohort effect reflecting improved longevity of members born between 1925 and 1945.
The inclusion of this cohort effect strengthens the mortality assumption within the actuarial calculation.
The mortality assumption has been updated to reflect the assumption adopted in the latest actuarial funding valuation of the scheme undertaken at 31 March 2007.
The mortality assumption adopted predicts that a current 65 year old male 2007: 60 year old would have a life expectancy to age 85 2007: age 87 and a female would have a life expectancy to age 87 2007: age 90.
The effect of increasing this assumed life expectancy by one year is predicted to increase the deficit in the schemes by approximately 9m.
The assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted.
If the discount rate were to change by 0.1% then it is predicted that the deficit in the scheme would change by 7m.
