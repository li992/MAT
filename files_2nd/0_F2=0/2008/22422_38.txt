Securities listed on a recognised stock exchange are generally regarded as being readily convertible into cash and hence unrealised profits less losses amounting to 150,478,000, currently included within Other capital reserves unrealised reserve, may be regarded as distributable.
However, under the terms of the Companys Articles of Association, sums within Other capital reserves are available for distribution only by way of redemption or purchase of any of the Companys own shares.
In addition, in order to maintain investment trust status, the Company may only distribute accumulated realised profits.
