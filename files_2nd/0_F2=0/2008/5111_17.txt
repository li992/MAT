Goodwill impairment testing note 7 Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
easyJet assumes that it has only one cash-generating unit being its complete route network.
In making this assessment, easyJet has considered the manner in which the business is managed including the centralised nature of the Groups operations and the ability to open or close routes and redeploy aircraft and crew across the whole route network.
The value in use of the cash-generating unit is determined by discounting future cash flows to their present value.
When applying this method, the Company relies on a number of estimates including strategic plans, pre tax weighted average cost of capital, fuel prices, exchange rates and the long-term growth rate assumption applicable to the sector.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is derecognised e. g. through expiry or disposal, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Where the hedged item is a highly probable forecast transaction, the related gains and losses remain in shareholders funds until the transaction takes place.
When a hedged future transaction is no longer expected to occur, any related gains and losses previously recognised in shareholders funds are immediately recognised in the income statement.

6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year retained for equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year after adjusting for shares held in employee share trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
Share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year are considered to be dilutive potential shares.
Where share options are exercisable based on performance criteria and those performance criteria have been met during the year, these options are included in the calculation of dilutive potential shares.

Rights at Gatwick were valued at 72.4 million by applying the multi-period excess earnings method to forecast operating cash flows.
The key assumptions in this valuation are the discount rate, fuel price and exchange rates for the US dollar and euro.
Rights at Heathrow were not operated by easyJet after 29 March 2008 and were sold for proceeds of 30.0 million before the year end.
They were classified at acquisition as assets held for sale and are not included in the above tables.
Rights at Manchester and at the downroute airports were fair valued at nil as there are no significant capacity constraints at those airports.
easyJet has one cash generating unit, being its route network.
The recoverable amount of goodwill and other assets with indefinite expected useful lives has been determined based on value in use of the route network.
Cash flow projections have been derived from management-approved three-year forecasts, using the following key assumptions: Pre tax discount rate derived from weighted average cost of capital 10.8% Fuel price, per metric tonne, in US dollars 920 Exchange rates US dollar 1.75 Euro 1.25 Swiss franc 2.08 Both fuel price and exchange rates have been volatile during the past year, and the assumptions used represent managements view of reasonable average rates.
Operating margins are sensitive to significant changes in these rates.
Cash flow projections beyond the forecast period have been extrapolated using real growth rate scenarios ranging from zero up to an estimated average of long-term growth rates for the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy.
No impairment resulted from any of these scenarios.

easyJets initial investment was 6.9 million in the form of loan notes of two classes bearing interest at fixed rates of 8% and 11%.
The blended interest rate on the loan notes is 8.07%, and interest receivable is settled by the issue of additional loan notes.
Redemption is governed by a priority agreement among the consortium members.
During the year ended 30 September 2002 the carrying value of the loan notes was impaired to zero due to uncertainty over the timing of returns to easyJet following the events of 11 September 2001.
In June 2007 NATS announced that it would recommence paying dividends: as a consequence the present value of easyJets loan notes investment exceeded their carrying value and the impairment was reversed in July 2007. million At 1 October 2007 11.1 Interest receivable converted to loan notes 0.9 At 30 September 2008 12.0 Loan notes Impairment Total million million million At 1 October 2006 10.6 10.6 Interest receivable converted to loan notes 0.6 0.6 Amortisation of loan issue costs 0.1 0.1 Impairment reversal relating to prior years 10.6 10.6 At 30 September 2007 11.1 11.1 The impairment reversal relating to prior years comprises: million Reinstatement of original loan notes and acquisition costs 6.9 Interest receivable to 30 September 2006 converted to loan notes 3.7 10.6 10 Other non-current assets 2008 2007 million million Recoverable supplemental rent on leased aircraft pledged as collateral 54.2 54.4 Prepayments 6.9 3.7 61.1 58.1 Supplementary rent is pledged to lessors to provide collateral should an aircraft be returned in a condition that does not meet the requirements of the lease and is refunded when qualifying heavy maintenance is performed, or is offset against the costs incurred at the end of the lease.
11 Assets held for sale Seven Airbus A321 and five Airbus A319, measured at carrying value, are classified as assets held for sale at 30 September 2008.
These aircraft are to be sold as part of managements strategy to manage capacity growth during the coming year.
They were classified as assets held for sale in July 2008 and are expected to be sold within one year from that date.

Amounts due from trade receivables are short term in nature and largely comprise credit card receivables placed with high credit quality financial institutions, accordingly, the possibility of default is considered to be unlikely.
The carrying amount of trade and other receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated is nil in both the current and prior year.

Discretionary schemes Options awarded in 2001 in connection with easyJets admission to the Official List had a three-year vesting period and no performance conditions.
All other awards have a three-year vesting period and performance conditions based on growth in earnings per share.
During the year the options granted in December 2004 and June 2005 vested in full as the average annual growth in EPS over the three years to September 2007 exceeded RPI plus 20%.
All options expire ten years after grant.
Sharesave Sharesave is open to all employees on the UK payroll.
Participants may elect to save up to 250 per month under a three-year savings contract.
An option is granted by the Company to buy shares at a discount of 20% from market price at the time of the grant.
At the end of the savings period, a tax free bonus is applied to the savings and the option becomes exercisable for a period of six months.
Employees who are not paid through the UK payroll may save under similar terms and conditions, albeit without tax benefits.
Share incentive plan The share incentive plan is open to all employees on the UK payroll.
Participants may invest up to 1,500 of their pre tax salary each year to purchase partnership shares in easyJet.
For each partnership share acquired easyJet purchases a matching share.
Employees must remain with easyJet for three years from the date of purchase of each partnership share in order to qualify for the matching share, and for five years for the shares to be transferred to them tax free.
The employee is entitled to dividends and to vote at shareholder meetings.
In October 2006 and December 2007, easyJet also granted free shares to all employees under the share incentive plan.
64 easyJet plc Notes to the Annual report and accounts 2008 financial statements continued Long term incentive plan The plan is open, by invitation, to Executive Directors and senior management, and provides for annual awards of performance shares worth up to 200% of salary each year and matching shares linked to the investment of up to 50% of annual bonus in easyJet shares.
The vesting of these awards is dependent on return on equity targets being achieved.
Chief Executive recruitment award In December 2005, on Andrew Harrison acquiring and retaining 1,000,000 worth of easyJet shares using his own funds, he was granted an equal number of shares with a three-year vesting period.
Half of the award is subject to performance conditions relating to the growth in EPS over the three years to September 2008.
The other half is subject to the same return on equity targets as the 2005 long term incentive plan award.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for each class of share award is as follows: Years Pre-flotation scheme 1.5 Discretionary schemes 6.2 Sharesave 2.7 Long term incentive plan 1.9 Share incentive plan 3.6 Chief Executive recruitment award 0.9 In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, fair values have not been calculated for grants of share options that occurred before 8 November 2002.
Exercise prices for these options lie between 1.61 and 3.65.
The fair value of other grants under the discretionary and sharesave schemes is estimated by applying a binomial option pricing model using the following assumptions.
The fair value of grants under all other schemes is the share price on the date of grant.
Exercise price for the discretionary schemes was determined using a five-day weighted average price.
For the Sharesave scheme, a 20% discount has been given between share price and exercise price.
Expected volatility is based on recent historical volatility over a period comparable to the expected life of each type of option.
In all cases the assumed dividend yield is zero as easyJet does not pay dividends.
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.

The acquisition has been unconditionally cleared and completion occurred on 31 January 2008.
The assets and liabilities acquired and their provisional fair values are as follows: Carrying Provisional amount fair value million million Landing rights 72.4 Other intangible assets 2.5 Property, plant and equipment 85.0 83.4 Other non-current assets 6.2 2.7 Assets held for sale 30.0 Current assets excluding cash and cash equivalents 59.7 55.6 Cash and cash equivalents 15.4 15.1 Current liabilities, excluding borrowings and overdrafts 85.5 91.6 Overdrafts 3.7 3.7 Borrowings 59.1 59.1 Deferred tax liabilities 22.0 Maintenance provisions 3.3 6.1 Net assets acquired 14.7 79.2 Goodwill 50.2 14.7 129.4 Purchase consideration Initial consideration paid 103.5 Deferred consideration paid 21.6 Direct acquisition costs 4.3 129.4 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 15.1 Overdrafts acquired 3.7 Cash outflow 118.0 Carrying amounts represent the assets and liabilities of GB Airways at completion determined in accordance with IFRS.
Fair values are stated after accounting policy alignments and fair value adjustments.
The principal fair value adjustments were the recognition of landing rights slots at Gatwick and Heathrow at fair value, and related deferred tax provisions.
The Heathrow landing rights are shown as assets held for sale as these were not operated by easyJet after 29 March 2008.
These rights were sold in June 2008, and, in accordance with the acquisition agreement, the proceeds were remitted to the vendors.
Additional fair value adjustments have been made since the publication of easyJets Interim Report for the six months ended 31 March 2008.
These adjustments, totalling 7.5 million before tax relief, principally comprise irrecoverable debtors and valuation adjustments relating to aircraft ordered by GB Airways for delivery during 2009.
Goodwill is attributable to the anticipated future operating synergies derived from improved yield, cost economies of scale and additional network destinations.
Prior to the acquisition, GB Airways commenced an arbitration action in the London Court of International Arbitration, concerning the interpretation of the franchise agreement with British Airways.
This action is due to be heard in 2009, and any settlement from British Airways above an agreed amount will be remitted to the vendors as additional deferred consideration.
The purchase consideration and net assets acquired shown above do not include any amount in respect of this action as it cannot be reliably measured.
GB Airways recorded a loss before tax of 4.9 million for the period from 1 February to 29 March 2008: this loss has been provided for in the fair value adjustments as the final two months of operations under the British Airways franchise agreement represented an onerous contract.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 October 2007, easyJets consolidated revenue and profit before tax for the year ended 30 September 2008 would have been 2,433.8 million and 107.8 million respectively.
These figures include 71.0 million of revenue and 2.5 million of profit before tax in respect of GB Airways operations for the period 1 October 2007 to 31 January 2008 and the loss before tax incurred in February and March 2008 treated as an onerous contract.
With effect from 30 March 2008 the GB Airways operations were merged into the existing easyJet business, and separate disclosure of revenue and profit after that date is impracticable.

Where carrying value does not equal fair value, the fair value has been estimated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
For all other financial instruments fair value approximates to carrying value.
Non-financial instruments represent amounts recognised in the balance sheet for the line items disclosed above that do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are disclosed in order to provide sufficient information to permit reconciliation of the carrying values above to those presented in the balance sheet.

70 easyJet plc Notes to the Annual report and accounts 2008 financial statements continued Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges All derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied are designated as cash flow hedges, with only the intrinsic value being designated for option instruments.
Changes in fair value are recognised directly in shareholders funds, to the extent that they are effective, with the ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement.
Where the hedged item results in a non-financial asset or liability, the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in shareholders funds are included in the carrying value of that asset or liability.
Otherwise accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged items affects the income statement.
easyJet uses forward contracts and zero cost collars to hedge transaction currency risk, jet fuel price risk and surplus euro and Swiss franc monetary balances.
Transaction currency risk includes capital expenditure, lease payments, debt repayments and fuel payments.
Where these hedges are assessed as highly effective, gains and losses are deferred in shareholders funds and transferred to the income statement or cost of property, plant and equipment when the related cash flow occurs.
The cumulative net gains losses deferred in shareholders funds and their expected maturities are as follows: Within 1 year 12 years Total At 30 September 2008 million million million Hedges of transaction currency risk 86.0 15.7 101.7 Hedges of jet fuel price risk 67.3 3.8 63.5 18.7 19.5 38.2 Related deferred tax 10.6 Net gains 27.6 Within 1 year 12 years Total At 30 September 2007 million million million Hedges of transaction currency risk 25.8 6.1 31.9 Hedges of jet fuel price risk 14.4 14.4 11.4 6.1 17.5 Related deferred tax 3.8 Net losses 13.7 The amount deferred and recognised in shareholders funds during each financial year is disclosed in note 20.

easyJet has no other significant currency net monetary exposure at each balance sheet date.
In accordance with IAS 21, monetary assets and liabilities are revalued using exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
This exposure is managed by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Net US dollar monetary liabilities at the balance sheet date comprise the following: 2008 2007 million million Cash and money market deposits 432.5 369.6 Loans 453.5 327.5 Maintenance provisions 101.9 67.6 Net working capital 58.1 21.5 181.0 47.0 24 Financial risk and capital management easyJet is exposed to financial risks including fluctuations in exchange rates, jet fuel prices and interest rates.
Financial risk management aims to limit these market risks with selected derivative hedging instruments being used for this purpose.
easyJet policy is not to trade in derivatives but to use the instruments to hedge anticipated exposure, as such, easyJet is not exposed to market risk by using derivatives as any gains and losses arising are offset by the outcome of the underlying exposure being hedged.
In addition to market risks, easyJet is exposed to credit and liquidity risk.
The Board is responsible for setting financial risk management policy and objectives which are implemented by the treasury function on a day-to-day basis.
The policy outlines the approach to risk management and also states the instruments and time periods which the treasury function is authorised to use in managing financial risks.
The policy is under ongoing review to ensure best practice in light of developments in the financial markets.
Foreign currency risk management The principal exposure to currency exchange rates arises from fluctuations in both the US dollar and euro rates which impact operating, financing and investing activities.
The aim of foreign currency risk management is to reduce the impact of exchange rate volatility on the results of the Group.
Foreign exchange exposure arising from transactions in various currencies is reduced through a policy of matching, as far as possible, receipts and payments in each individual currency.
Any remaining anticipated exposure is managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and zero cost collars.
In addition, easyJet has substantial US dollar balance sheet liabilities, largely offset by holding US dollar cash: any residual net liability is managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Fuel price risk management easyJet is exposed to fuel price risk.
The objective of the fuel price risk management policy is to provide protection against sudden and significant increases in jet fuel prices whilst retaining access to price reductions.
In order to manage the risk exposure, zero cost collars and forward contracts are used in line with Board approved policy of hedging a maximum of 80% of estimated exposures up to 12 months in advance, and to hedge a smaller percentage of estimated usage up to 24 months in advance.
In exceptional market conditions, the Board may accelerate or limit the implementation of the hedging policy.
Financing and interest rate risk management Interest rate cash flow risk arises on floating rate borrowings and cash investments.
Interest rate risk management policy aims to provide certainty in a proportion of financing while retaining the opportunity to benefit from interest rate reductions.
Interest rate policy is used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
All loans are at floating interest rates repricing every three to six months.
A significant proportion of the US dollar loans are matched with US dollar cash, with the cash being invested to coincide with the repricing of the debt.
Operating leases are a mix of fixed and floating rates.
Of the operating leases in place at 30 September 2008 approximately 60% of lease payments were based on fixed interest rates and 40% were based on floating interest rates 2007: 54% fixed, 46% floating.
All debt is asset related, reflecting the capital intensive nature of the airline industry and the attractiveness of aircraft as security to lenders.
These factors are also reflected in the medium-term profile of the Groups loans and operating leases.
During the year 13 aircraft were cash acquired.
In addition, all aircraft to be delivered through to 30 September 2009 have committed financing in place at 30 September 2008 2007: 11 of 49.
72 easyJet plc Notes to the Annual report and accounts 2008 financial statements continued Credit risk management easyJet is exposed to credit risk arising from liquid funds, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk management aims to reduce the risk of counterparty default through limiting aggregate credit exposure to any one individual counterparty, based on its credit rating.
Such counterparty exposures are regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary.
Accordingly, the possibility of material loss arising in the event of non-performance by counterparties is considered to be unlikely.
Credit risk is limited to the carrying amount recognised at the balance sheet date.
Disclosure relating to the credit quality of trade and other receivables is detailed in note 12.
The credit risk for liquid funds and other short-term financial assets is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
For deposits with financial institutions, internal limits are placed on the exposure to individual counterparties and a minimum external credit rating of A is required.
Liquidity risk management The objective of easyJets liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient cash resources and the availability of funding as required.
easyJet holds financial assets either for which there is a liquid market or which are expected to generate cash inflows that are available to meet liquidity needs.
In addition, easyJet has committed undrawn bank facilities of $1,135 million 2007: $250 million to support any funding requirements, being a $250 million revolving credit facility and a balance of $885 million of financing arrangements in respect of future aircraft deliveries, arranged during the year.
The cash, cash equivalent, restricted cash balances and money market deposits at 30 September 2008 totalled 928.7 million 2007: 961.3 million.
easyJet continues to hold significant cash or liquid funds to mitigate the impact of potential business disruption events with Board approved policy stating an absolute minimum level of liquidity that must be maintained at all times.
Surplus funds are invested, in line with Board approved policy, in high quality short-term liquid instruments, usually money market funds or bank deposits.
The maturity profile of easyJets financial liabilities based on the remaining contractual maturities is set out below.
The analysis represents undiscounted gross anticipated future cash flows.
Within Over 1 year 12 years 25 years 5 years 30 September 2008 million million million million Borrowings 85.5 96.9 291.2 296.0 Trade and other payables 304.1 Derivative contracts receipts 1,759.9 336.9 Derivative contracts payments 1,729.6 310.3 Within Over 1 year 12 years 25 years 5 years 30 September 2007 million million million million Borrowings 73.9 73.2 246.3 310.1 Trade and other payables 206.9 Derivative contracts receipts 641.3 200.4 Derivative contracts payments 642.4 204.3 Market risk sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings, deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and derivative financial instruments.
The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in relevant foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on profit or loss after tax and shareholders funds on financial instruments held at the reporting date.
It does not reflect changes in revenue or costs that may result from changing currency rates, interest rates or fuel prices.
Each sensitivity is calculated based on all other variables remaining constant.
The analysis below is considered representative of easyJets exposure over the 12 month period.
The currency sensitivity analysis is based on easyJets foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date taking into account forward exchange contracts and zero cost collars that offset effects from changes in currency exchange rates.
The increased sensitivity in the US dollar and euro rate represents sterling weakening against each variable currency with the 10% sensitivity showing a stronger sterling sensitivity.
The fuel price sensitivity analysis is based on easyJets fuel related derivative financial instruments held at the end of each reporting period.
The sensitivity applied to both currency rates and the fuel price is based on reasonably possible change in the rate applied to the value of financial instruments at the balance sheet date.

Currency rates Interest rates Fuel price US dollar 10% US dollar 10% Euro 10% Euro 10% 1% increase 10% increase At 30 September 2008 million million million million million million Income statement impact: gain loss 3.6 2.9 2.3 1.9 2.4 Impact on shareholders funds: increase decrease 86.8 70.5 27.1 22.1 27.6 Currency rates Interest rates Fuel price US dollar 10% US dollar 10% Euro 10% Euro 10% 1% increase 10% increase At 30 September 2007 million million million million million million Income statement impact: gain loss 6.3 5.2 2.4 2.4 3.4 Impact on shareholders funds: increase decrease 62.9 54.0 9.4 The impact of a 1% increase in interest rates and a 10% increase in the fuel price is disclosed above.
A corresponding decrease in each of the rates results in an equal and opposite impact on the income statement and shareholders funds in both reporting periods.
Capital management The objective of capital management is to ensure that easyJet is able to continue as a going concern whilst delivering shareholder expectations of a strong capital base as well as returning benefits for other stakeholders and optimising the cost of capital.
easyJet manages its capital structure in response to changes in both economic conditions and strategic objectives.
The cash and net debt position together with the maturity profile of existing debt is monitored to ensure the continuity of funding.
During the year, a major aircraft financing programme was put in place though a number of bi-lateral facilities totalling $937 million.
The principal measure used by easyJet to manage capital risk is the gearing ratio of debt debt plus seven times aircraft operating lease payments less cash, including money market deposits and restricted cash to shareholders funds.
Gearing increased in the year from 20.4% to 28.8%.
Cash was used to purchase GB Airways and the acquisition resulted in taking on additional borrowings related to owned aircraft and additional lease costs.
A strengthening US dollar in the year also contributed to increased indebtedness and lease costs.
