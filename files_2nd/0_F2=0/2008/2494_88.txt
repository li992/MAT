24 Financial instruments Management of financial risks One of the principal responsibilities of Treasury is to manage the financial risks arising from the Groups underlying operations.
Specifically, Treasury manages, within an overall policy framework, the Groups exposure to funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty risks.
The Group defines capital as net debt see note 21 and equity see note 20.
The only externally imposed capital requirement for the Group is interest cover as described under interest rate risk below.
The Group assesses its financial capacity by reference to cash flow and interest cover.
Group policies include a set of financing principles, including the monitoring of credit ratings, interest cover and liquidity.
These provide a framework within which the Groups capital base is managed and, in particular, the policies on dividends as a percentage of long-term sustainable earnings and share buy-back are decided.
The Group manages its financial risks in line with the classification of its financial assets and liabilities in the Groups balance sheet and related notes.
The Groups management of specific risks is dealt with as follows: Liquidity risk It is the policy of the Group to maximise financial flexibility and minimise refinancing risk by issuing debt with a range of maturities, generally matching the projected cash flows of the Group and obtaining this financing from a wide range of providers.
The Group has a target average centrally managed debt maturity of 5 years with no more than 20 per cent of centrally managed debt maturing in a single year.
As at 31 December 2008, the average centrally managed debt maturity was 5.1 years 2007: 5.4 years and the highest proportion of centrally managed debt maturing in a single year was 18.3 per cent 2007: 16.7 per cent.
It is Group policy that short-term sources of funds including drawings under the US dollar commercial paper programme are backed by undrawn committed lines of credit and cash.
