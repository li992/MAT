qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 38 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 General information The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of James Fisher and Sons Public Limited Company the Company all of its subsidiary undertakings and the Groups interest in associates and jointly controlled entities together referred to as the Group, for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and on an historical cost basis, modified to include revaluation to fair value of certain financial instruments as described below.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and financial statements.
As highlighted in Note 29 to the financial statements, the Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through operating cash flows, with borrowings in place to fund acquisitions and capital expenditure.
The group also has 35,430,000 of undrawn committed facilities.
The current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over a the exchange rate currency between Sterling and the US Dollar and the consequences for the net cash Dollar surplus and b the exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro and thus the consequences on seafarer payroll costs: and c the availability of bank facilities in the immediate future.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facilities.
During 2009 borrowing facilities of 7,750,000 total facility 12,500,000 are fully repayable.
This facility relates to the Singapore Submarine rescue contract which is due to complete in April 2009 when full payment of S$43,868,000 15,981,000 will become due and is expected to be received by 30 June 2009, the latest date for repayment of the facility.
The Group has two revolving credit facilities due for renewal in 2010: a 20,000,000 facility which expires on 27 September 2010 and a 20,000,000 facility which ends on 22 December 2010.
The amounts drawn on these facilities at 31 December 2008 are 19,215,000 and 16,000,000 respectively.
The Group will open renewal negotiations with banks in due course and has at no stage sought any written commitment that the facility will be renewed.
However, the Group has held discussions with its bankers about its future borrowing needs and no matters have been drawn to its attention to suggest the renewal may not be forthcoming on acceptable terms.
The Group and Company present their financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, adopted by the European Union adopted IFRS.
The Company is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in England & Wales.
The Companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Company and consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 16 March 2009.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate income statement and related notes for the holding company have not been presented in these financial statements.
The profit after taxation in the holding company was 6,201,000 2007 6,900,000.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except when otherwise indicated.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements and those of the Company have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union EU as at 31 December 2008 and are applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
Significant accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year, is set out below.
During the year the Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations: IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction early adopted.
Adoption of these revised standards did not have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
The amendments in respect of IFRIC 11 are included in Note 17.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 39 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Significant accounting judgements and estimates Financial and business risks The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial and business risks.
Where possible the Group seeks to minimise these risks through its risk management policies as set out on page 19 of the Corporate governance statement.
Pensions The Group and its subsidiaries participate in a number of pension schemes, including defined benefit schemes.
The nature of these defined benefit arrangements, the volatility of the scheme valuations deficits from time to time, changes in the market conditions for bond yields and equities, and sensitivity to changes in actuarial assumptions e. g. as to life expectancy mean that it is impossible to predict future contribution liabilities with any degree of certainty.
Details of the Group pension schemes and the assumptions underlying their valuations are set out in Note 25.
Impairment of goodwill The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy on page 42.
An analysis of the Groups goodwill and the assumptions used to test for impairment are set out in Note 13.
Impairment of other assets The Group reviews the carrying value of all assets for indications of impairment at each balance sheet date.
If indicators of impairment exist the carrying value of the asset is subject to further testing to determine whether its carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount represents the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, which is determined by measuring the discounted cash flows arising from the asset including ultimate realisation on disposal.
Following the performance of a review in 2008 in relation to mt Rudderman which is due to be redelivered to its owners in March 2009, the directors concluded that the carrying value exceeded the recoverable amount and an impairment of this asset had occurred.
Further details are provided in Note 5.
Intangible assets The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on business combinations requires the performance of a review of the acquired business to assess whether such assets exist and can be identified separately and reliably measured.
The Group has not identified any such additional items in the business combinations which occurred during the year.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in several jurisdictions.
Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax risk issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
The Group has entered the UK tonnage tax regime under which tax on its ship owning and operating activities is based on the net tonnage of vessels operated.
Income and profits outside this regime are taxed under normal tax rules.
This means that it is necessary to make estimates of the allocation of some income and expenses between tonnage and non tonnage tax activities.
These estimates are subject to agreement with the relevant tax authorities and may be revised in future periods.
Further details are provided in Notes 9 and 10.
Construction contracts The Groups Defence division is currently undertaking two significant construction contracts which are expected to generate total revenue of 25,742,000.
As set out in the accounting policy on page 47 revenue and costs have been taken into account in accordance with the stage of completion of the contracts after consideration of the expected profit and possibility of future losses arising.
Although the Directors consider the possibility of losses to be remote provision for any such losses would be recognised in the income statement at the time when the loss became reasonably forseeable.
Details of the amounts included in the accounts in relation to these contracts are set out in Note 3.
Residual values and estimated remaining lives Assets other than vessels are depreciated to a zero residual value over their useful economic lives.
Residual values for vessels are set initially at 20% of purchase cost or fair value at acquisition, which is regarded as an approximation of current residual values.
Changes in the residual values and estimated lives of assets would result in adjustments to the current and future rate of depreciation and amortisation through the income statement or the creation of impairment provisions.
Residual values and estimated remaining lives are reviewed annually by the directors taking into account the condition of vessels, future trading expectations and observable market transactions.
See Note 15 for details of movements on tangible fixed assets in the year.
Investments The Group holds a number of investments in unquoted entities.
These interests are accounted for as investments as the Group does not consider that it exercises significant influence over the policies and control of these entities.
As the fair value of these shareholdings cannot be readily ascertained or reliably measured these investments are held at initial cost subject to annual impairment review.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 40 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued The Group holds investments in subsidiaries operating in certain jurisdictions where foreign investors are prohibited from owning a majority of the equity share capital of locally domiciled entities.
These investments have been structured so that in the opinion of the directors the Group is able to assert a dominant influence to the extent that it is able to consolidate 100% of the operations and is not required to recognise a minority interest in these entities.
Basis of preparation of group accounts The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses resulting from intra-group transactions that are recognised in assets, are eliminated in full.
Entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long term basis and are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement are treated as joint ventures.
In the Group financial statements joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The investment in joint ventures is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus the Groups post acquisition share in the change in net assets of the joint ventures less any impairment provision.
The income statement reflects the Groups share of the post tax result of the joint ventures.
The Groups share of any changes recognised by the joint venture in equity are also recognised by the Group in equity.
Minority interests represent the proportion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group and are presented separately in the income statement and within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Acquisitions of minority interests are accounted for using the parent entity extension method, whereby the difference between the consideration and the book value of the share of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Foreign currency i Group The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
The net investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated from their functional currency into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange differences arising on the retranslation of opening net assets are taken directly to the translation reserve.
Exchange differences arising on monetary items forming part of the Groups net investment in overseas subsidiary undertakings which are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary undertaking are taken directly to the translation reserve.
Exchange differences on other foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to provide an effective hedge against group equity investments in foreign currency are taken directly to the translation reserve.
Exchange differences on the net investment in overseas subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the translation reserve until such time as the subsidiary is disposed of at which time they are included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition are translated into Sterling at the period end exchange rate.
The income and expenses arising in foreign operations are translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting period.
All other exchange differences on transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on settlement of monetary items or on the retranslation of monetary items at rates different from those at which they were initially recognised are taken to the income statement.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences included in the translation reserve are also dealt with in the translation reserve.
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 1 - First time adoption of IFRS, the Group elected not to recognise the cumulative foreign currency translation differences arising in prior periods in a separate translation reserve.
Therefore the cumulative foreign currency translation differences at 1 January 2004 are deemed to be zero.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 41 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 ii Company Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
All other exchange differences on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are taken to the income statement.
The Companys investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost.
Income is recognised from these investments only if it arises from distributions received from post acquisition profits.
Distributions received in excess of post acquisition profits are deducted from the cost of the investment.
Financial assets The Group recognises three classes of financial assets: Loans and receivables Available for sale financial assets Derivatives a Loans and receivables These comprise non-derivative financial assets such as trade receivables with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and where there is no intention to trade the receivable.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money may have a significant impact on their value.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans or receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through the amortisation process.
If there is evidence of an impairment loss on assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the estimated future cash flows after excluding amounts already provided against, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
If in a subsequent period the factors which indicated the original decision to impair the asset cease to exist or are mitigated then the previously recognised impairment loss can be reversed subject to the revised carrying value of the asset not exceeding its amortised cost at the date the impairment is reversed.
Any reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
A provision is made against a trade receivable only when there is objective evidence that the Group may not be able to recover all of the amount due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through the use of a provision for doubtful debts account.
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectable.
b Available for sale financial assets These are non-derivatives that are either designated or not classed as another category.
These are included as non-current assets unless intended to be disposed of within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
After initial recognition available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value with gains and losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or deemed to be impaired at which point the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the income statement in the period in which it arises.
Where investments are held in unlisted equity shares where there is no active market the investment is held at cost within non-current assets and is subject to annual impairment within non-current assets.
If an available for sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost net of any principal payment and amortisation and its current fair value, less any previously recognised impairment loss is transferred from equity to profit or loss.
Reversal of impairment provisions are not recognised in profit or loss.
c Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
Assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are recorded at cost which represents the fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 42 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets having finite lives are amortised over their useful economic life and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that they are impaired.
The amortisation period is reviewed at the end of each accounting period.
The amortisation of intangible assets is recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits arising from that specific asset.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and business units represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less provision for impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill arising on each acquisition is reviewed annually for impairment but more regularly if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
For the purposes of determining impairment of purchased goodwill carried in the balance sheet, all goodwill is allocated against the appropriate combination of business units deemed to obtain advantage from the benefits acquired with the goodwill.
These are designated as cash generating units CGU.
Impairment is then assessed by comparing the recoverable amount of the relevant CGU with the carrying value of the CGUs assets and liabilities and related goodwill.
Recoverable amount is measured as the higher of the CGUs fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
Where relevant in order to assess the value of goodwill the Group combines a number of CGUs.
Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year to 31 December 1997 and earlier periods which was written off to reserves in accordance with the accounting standard then in force, has not been reinstated in the balance sheet and will continue to be accounted for in reserves even if the business to which it relates is subsequently disposed of.
For goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 amortisation ceased at transition to IFRS and it is carried at its previous carrying amount subject to provision for impairment.
When an impairment loss is recognised it cannot be reversed in a subsequent accounting period, even if the circumstances which led to the impairment cease to exist.
Warranty costs Provision is made for warranties offered with products where it is probable that an obligation to transfer economic benefits to the customer in future will arise.
This provision is based on managements assessment of the previous history of claims and probability of future obligations arising on a product by product basis.
No provisions for warranty costs are included in the balance sheet at 31 December 2008.
Separately disclosed items The Group presents separately on the face of the income statement material items of income and expense which, because of their nature, infrequency of occurrence or the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the financial performance of the year in comparison with previous periods and to assess better trends in financial performance.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Refit costs relating to vessels are capitalised separately when incurred and amortised over 30 months which is deemed to be the useful economic life of the asset.
Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits associated with the asset to which it relates.
Depreciation is provided to write-down the cost of property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation to their residual value in equal annual instalments over their remaining estimated useful lives.
Ships 4% to 10% Freehold property 2.5% Leasehold improvements 2.5% or over the period of the lease Plant and equipment 5% to 20% No depreciation is charged on assets under construction.
Residual values for vessels are set initially at 20% of purchase cost or fair value at acquisition, which the directors believe to be an approximation of current residual values.
Residual values and estimated remaining lives are reviewed annually by the directors and adjusted if appropriate to reflect the relevant market conditions and expectations, obsolescence and normal wear and tear.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 43 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 The cost of property, plant and equipment includes expenditure incurred during construction, delivery and modification.
Where a substantial period of time is required to bring the asset into use attributable finance costs are capitalised and included in the cost of the relevant asset.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there are any indications that an asset has been impaired.
If any indication exists the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of the asset concerned.
The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
These calculations are determined for an individual asset unless that asset does not generate cash inflows independently from other assets in which case its value is determined as part of that group of assets.
Where the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
To assess the value in use the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses on continuing and discontinued operations are recognised in the income statement.
If an event occurs after the recognition of an impairment that leads to a decrease in the amount of the impairment loss previously recognised the impairment loss is reversed.
The reversal is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
Research and development costs Expenditure undertaken by the Group on research activities is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Expenditure on development costs which relates to the application of research to the development of new products or processes is capitalised provided that specific projects are identifiable, technically feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The useful life of projects meeting the criteria for capitalisation would be determined on a project by project basis.
Other development costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The Group currently has no development costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, as follows: Raw materials, consumables stores and finished goods for sale - purchase cost on a first in first out basis: Work in progress and finished goods - cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads allocated on a systematic basis based on a normal level of activity: Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and sale or disposal.
Construction contracts i General Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs relating to the construction contract are recognised in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract, in the period in which the work is performed.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to physical progress, attributable man hours and costs incurred measured against the expected outcome based on the most appropriate method for the specific type of contract.
Revenue from the contract is recognised under the percentage of completion method whereby recognition is determined by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
Contract costs incurred that relate to future activity are deferred and recognised as inventory.
When a loss is expected to be incurred on a construction contract it is recognised as an expense immediately in the income statement.
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably no profit is recognised.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that costs incurred will be recovered.
ii Bid costs All bid costs incurred relating to contracts for the design, manufacture or operation of assets or the provision of services to third parties are expensed to the income statement as incurred, except for those costs incurred after the point at which the contract award is virtually certain.
Directly attributable costs incurred subsequent to this point are included within debtors and amortised over the life of the initial period of the contract to which they relate.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 44 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Taxation Tonnage tax payable is provided by reference to net tonnage of qualifying vessels at the current rate.
Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits from activities not qualifying for the tonnage tax regime and is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is also recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected corporation tax payable or receivable in respect of the taxable profit for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, less any adjustments to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities included in the financial statements and the amounts used for tax purposes, that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions: No provision is made where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable profit.
No provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences and unused tax losses and credits can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax arising on actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit pension funds is recorded in equity.
Where the cash contributions made to the schemes exceed the service costs recognised in the income statement the deferred tax arising is recorded in equity.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group operates in international markets and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily relating to the US Dollar and Norwegian Kroner.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk arising from long term borrowings.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge risk, in the form of foreign currency contracts to manage foreign exchange risk and interest rate swaps to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
All derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date.
Fair value is calculated by reference to current forward exchange contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The recognition of the gains or losses arising on these movements in fair value depends on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge and if so the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group recognises two classes of hedges for derivative financial instruments: Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or an unrecognised firm commitment fair value hedge : Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or recognised assets or liabilities cash flow hedge : Cash flow hedges These can include forward foreign currency contracts which the Group will enter into only if they meet the following criteria: The instrument must be related to a firm foreign currency risk of a firm commitment: It must involve the same currency as the hedged item: and It must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
These may also include interest rate swaps which must have the following characteristics: The instrument must be related to a recognised asset or a liability: and It must change the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 45 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
Gains or losses arising on any portion deemed to be ineffective are recognised immediately in the income statement within cost of sales.
Where the hedge relates to a firm commitment or forecast transaction which subsequently results in the recognition of an asset or liability the cumulative gain or loss relating to that item is removed from equity and included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
Otherwise the cumulative amount is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the related movements on the hedged transaction.
When the term of the hedging instrument expires or it is sold, or where the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss included in equity is retained in equity until either the related forecast transaction occurs in which case it is recognised in accordance with the policy stated above, or if the hedged transaction is not expected to take place, it is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative is designated as a hedge of the variability in the fair value of an asset or liability of the Group, it is designated as a fair value hedge.
Changes in the fair value of any derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting under any of the criteria outlined above are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Calculation of fair values The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using assumptions based on market conditions at the balance sheet date or discounted cash flow techniques.
Interest-bearing loans and other borrowings All interest-bearing loans and other borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, which represents the fair value of the consideration received net of any issue costs associated with other borrowings.
Finance charges, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption of debt instruments including preference shares and the direct costs of issue, are accounted for on an amortised cost basis to the income statement.
Charges are calculated using the effective interest method, and are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Finance charges are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Accounting for leases i Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
ii Finance leases A lease arrangement under which substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item rest with the lessee are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the related item or the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction in the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are expensed to the income statement.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset.
Pension plans i Defined contribution scheme Under this type of pension plan the Group pays a pre-determined contribution to a separate privately administered pension plan.
Other than this contribution the Group has no further legal or constructive obligation to make further contributions to the scheme.
Obligations for contributions to the scheme are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
ii Defined benefit scheme A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan under which the amount of pension benefit that an employee receives on retirement is defined by reference to factors including age, years of service and compensation.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 46 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued The schemes are funded by payments determined by periodic actuarial calculations agreed between the Group and the trustees to trusteeadministered funds.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period current service cost and to current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Current service costs are recognised in the income statement in the current year.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement which eliminates all obligations for benefits already accrued or a curtailment which reduces future obligations as a result of a reduction in future entitlement occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in the present value of scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time.
The expected return on plan assets is based on the long-term market returns on scheme assets assessed at the start of the period adjusted for the effect of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
A liability is recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups net obligations to the schemes which is calculated separately for each scheme.
The liability represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the scheme assets together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses, past service costs and curtailments.
The defined benefit obligations represent the estimated amount of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their services in current and prior periods, discounted at a rate representing the yield on a high quality corporate bond at the balance sheet date, denominated in the same currency as the obligations and having the same terms to maturity as the related pension liability, applied to the estimated future cash outflows arising from these obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The value of any asset recognised is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service cost and the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
The benefit recognised will be no greater than the expected cost of the future benefit accrual, life assurance and expenses payable from the scheme.
In respect of recognising any obligations the Group or Company holds for funding the plan, the Group holds as a minimum liability the expected cost of deficit recovery contributions up to the disclosure date of the next formal actuarial valuation of the plan reduced by the expected cost of future accrual, life assurance and expenses.
Actuarial gains and losses on experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions that arise subsequent to 1 January 2004 are recognised in the period in which they arise directly in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Equity-settled share based payments The Company operates executive share option schemes and a savings related share option scheme under which options have been granted to employees of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
For options granted since 7 November 2002 the fair value of employee services rendered in exchange for the grant of options is determined by the fair value of the option at the date of grant.
The total amount, which is expensed over the specified period until the options can be exercised the vesting period, is recognised cumulatively as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding credit to equity.
The fair value of the option is determined by the use of mathematical modelling techniques, including the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the Binomial model.
Non-market vesting conditions such as profitability and growth targets are excluded from the fair value calculation but included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
The Company re-assesses its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable at each balance sheet date.
Any adjustments to the original estimates are recognised in the income statement and equity over the remaining vesting period with any element of any adjustments relating to prior periods recognised in the current period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, such as the performance of the Group relative to a group or index composed of third party entities.
These are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 47 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 When awards are made to employees of a subsidiary, the award is treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary with a corresponding increase in the cost of investment being reflected in the Company balance sheet.
Where the exercise of options is satisfied by the issue of shares by the company the nominal value of any shares issued from the exercise of options is credited to share capital with the balance of the proceeds received, net of transaction costs, credited to share premium.
Short term employee benefits The Group recognises a liability and an expense for short term employee benefits, including bonuses, only when contractually or constructively obliged.
Treasury shares Shares issued by the Company which are held by the Company or its subsidiary entities including the Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOP, are designated as treasury shares.
The cost of these shares is deducted from equity.
No gains or losses are recognised on the purchase, sale, cancellation or issue of treasury shares.
Consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity.
ESOP Trust Company shares are held in an Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP.
The finance costs and administration costs relating to the ESOP are charged to the income statement.
Dividend income arising on own shares is excluded in arriving at profit before taxation and deducted from aggregate dividends paid.
The shares are ignored for the purposes of calculating the Groups earnings per share.
Segmental reporting The Groups primary reporting format is its business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
A segment is a component of the Group which can be distinguished separately as providing a product or service within a particular environment which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
The Group has identified four business segments: Offshore Oil Services - manufacture and rental of equipment for the offshore oil and gas industry, trading under the Scan Tech, Fisher Offshore, Buchan and Reanco names and the design and manufacture of specialist downhole tools and equipment for extracting oil under the Pumptools and Remote Marine Systems brands.
Specialist Technical Services - provision of vessel management and equipment services to the marine sector including fendering and ship to ship transfer services under the Fender Care name.
Decommissioning and remote operations and monitoring services, predominantly to the Nuclear industry under the James Fisher Nuclear brand and control, load measurement and structural monitoring equipment under the Strainstall brand.
Defence - provision of marine services to the Ministry of Defence MoD and other navies including the UK submarine rescue service, maintenance, asset management and consultancy services provided by James Fisher Marine Services, and a 25% shareholding in Foreland Shipping which provides military strategic sealift capability via its operation of six Ro-Ro ferries for the MoD.
Marine Oil Services - delivery of refined petroleum products in North West Europe: Transfer pricing between business segments is set on an arms length basis similar to transactions with third parties.
The Groups geographical segments are determined by the location of the Groups assets and operations.
Revenue Revenue, after excluding trade discounts and value added tax, represents the provision of goods and services by the Group and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business and is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer.
The transfer of risks and rewards is assumed to pass to the customer on delivery of the goods or completion of the provision of the relevant services.
Where services rendered relate to long term contracts and are not completed at the balance sheet date, revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction measured by reference to the proportion of total expected costs incurred.
Revenue is not recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due.
Rentals receivable under operating leases are credited to revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term.
There are no rental commitments in respect of long term leasing arrangements.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 48 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Non-current assets held for sale On classification as held for sale, non-current assets are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale are included in profit or loss, as are any gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits included in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less from the original acquisition date.
Cash and cash equivalents included in the cash flow statement comprise cash and short-term deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
Net debt Net debt comprises interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Intra Group financial instruments Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 50 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Segmental information for December 2007 has been restated following the decision to transfer the results of Remote Marine Systems and Pumptools from the Specialist Technical Services division to the Offshore Oil Services division.
These businesses are involved in the supply of equipment and services used in oilfield development and it was therefore considered that their activities are more closely aligned with the existing businesses in the Offshore Oil Services division.
The impact of the restatement on the year ended 31 December 2007 segmental information is to increase the segmental revenue and result of the Offshore Oil Services division by 3,960,000 and 647,000 respectively, with a corresponding reduction in the revenue and operating results of the Specialist Technical Services division.

Any income and profits outside the tonnage tax regime are taxed under the normal tax rules of the relevant tax jurisdiction.
The tax charge is made up as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Current tax: UK tonnage tax 29 31 UK corporation tax 3,100 1,433 3,129 1,464 Tax under over provided in previous years 41 175 Foreign tax 1,632 1,542 Total current tax 4,802 2,831 Deferred tax: Origination and reversal of timing differences 475 302 Impact of change in rate 174 Total taxation on continuing operations 5,277 2,959 The total tax charge in the income statement is allocated as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Taxation expense reported in group income statement 5,277 2,959 Attributable to joint ventures 78 20 Total tax expense 5,355 2,979 Tax charged to equity in statement of recognised income and expense: Group Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 Current tax: Current tax on foreign exchange profit on internal loans 758 614 Deferred tax: Deferred tax relating to the actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes 1,010 276 1,010 276 Deferrred tax relating to share based payments 77 77 77 77 175 199 319 199 Reconciliation of effective tax rate The tax on the Groups profit on continuing activities differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the rate applicable under UK corporation tax rules as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Profit before tax from continuing operations 23,578 19,100 Tax arising on interests in joint ventures Note 16 78 20 Loss before tax from discontinued activities 6 23,656 19,114 At UK statutory tax rate of 28.5% 2007: 30% 6,742 5,734 Difference due to application of tonnage tax to all vessel disposals and operating activities 803 1,882 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 46 42 Chargeable gains 22 Over provision in previous years: Current tax 41 175 Deferred tax 18 269 Share based payments 332 Lower taxes on overseas income 773 258 Rate change on deferred tax 174 Research and development relief 140 Other 108 17 5,355 2,979 The effective income tax rate on profit from continuing operations is 22.4% 2007: 15.5%.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 56 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued The UK tax rate of 28.5% reflects the change in the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% which became effective on 1 April 2008.
Unrecognised tax losses At 31 December 2008 the Group has unrecognised tax losses of 1,507,000 2007: 1,025,000.
No Deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to the uncertainty relating to their future recovery.
The Group elected to enter tonnage tax with effect from 2000.
This election was renewed in 2008.
The shipping activities of FT Everard & Sons Limited entered the regime on acquisition in 2006.
The election had the effect of eliminating future potential tax liabilities on shipping profits of qualifying ships in the United Kingdom.
The regime includes provisions whereby a proportion of capital allowances previously claimed by the Group can be subject to tax in the event of a significant number of assets being sold and not replaced.
This contingent liability diminishes to nil over the seven year period following entry into tonnage tax.
The contingent liability relating to the ships operated by the Group on entry onto tonnage tax in 2000 has expired in accordance with this seven year provision.
However, there is a contingent liability at 31 December 2008 relating to the FT Everard fleet which entered into tonnage tax in 2006.
This assumes that any such ships unsold at 31 December are sold at the lower of net book value at 31 December 2008 and market value on entry into tonnage tax and that after 2008 no reliefs are available to reduce the balancing charge giving rise to the liability other than the seven year tapering relief provided in the Finance Act 2000.
No provision has been made on the basis that no liability is expected to arise.
10 Deferred tax Group Deferred tax at 31 December relates to the following: Group Group Balance sheet Income statement 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 Deferred tax assets Retirement benefits 1,152 190 48 189 Share based payments 87 443 279 118 1,239 633 Deferred tax liabilities Accelerated capital allowances for tax purposes 1,561 1,383 165 46 Roll over gains 1,459 1,476 17 11 3,020 2,859 Deferred income tax charge 475 128 Net deferred income tax liability 1,781 2,226 The gross movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Balance at 1 January 2,226 1,987 Credited charged to equity in statement of recognised income and expense 933 199 Charged to income statement 475 128 Exchange adjustments 6 Acquired with subsidiaries Note 18 7 88 Balance at 31 December 1,781 2,226 At 31 December 2008 the Group has no recognised deferred income tax liability 2007: nil in respect of taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Companys subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2008 the unrecognised gross temporary differences in respect of reserves of overseas subsidiaries is 6,443,000 2007: 2,174,000.
No deferred income tax liability has been recognised in respect of this temporary timing difference due to the availability of double taxation relief and the ability to control the remittance of earnings.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Group to its shareholders.
Change in Corporation tax rate The UK Corporation tax rate decreased from 30% to 28% from 1 April 2008.
The deferred tax balance was adjusted in the year ended 31 December 2007 to reflect this change.

11 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, after excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Employee Share Ownership Trust and held as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

Marine Oil Services Cattedown - The port facility business of FT Everard & Sons.
Defence Defence - comprises Mimic, Ocean fleets and the remaining parts of Rumic included in the Defence division.
These represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each cash generating unit CGU by segment is: 2008 2007 000 000 Offshore Oil Services Scan Tech Norway 14,924 14,626 Offshore 16,072 16,068 Specialist Technical Services Nuclear 4,511 4,511 Fendercare 7,625 7,292 Strainstall 11,232 9,064 Marine Oil Services Cattedown 10,259 10,259 Defence 5,370 5,370 69,993 67,190 The recoverable amount of these units has been assessed based on value in use calculations using cash projections based on financial budgets approved by the board for the next financial year together with projections derived from those budgets for the following four years.
A terminal value of cash flows beyond that date has been calculated at a growth rate in line with managements long term expectations for the relevant market.
Key assumptions used in the value in use calculations: Gross margin Discount rate Costs and payroll inflation Growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period Growth estimates are based on the levels achieved in the current and historic periods adjusted for management expectations of the impact of management actions and the future development of the relevant market.
Growth rates for turnover vary between 3% for Cattedown which operates in a relatively mature market to 7% to 9% for Fendercare and Strainstall, which operate in more developing markets.
These growth rates are considered to be reasonable in the light of the recent trading history of these businesses.
Direct costs are expected to increase in line with turnover in initial periods before stabilising at a long term inflationary level of 2%.
Administrative costs are anticipated to increase at 3%.
Payroll inflation reflects the fact that the Group provides specialist services in a competitive market.
Payroll costs are therefore influenced by the need to retain skilled staff.
As a result the initial growth rates for payroll costs range between 3.5% in mature business to up to 15% for specific posts in businesses located in the Middle East and Aberdeen where skilled staff are in short supply.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 60 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Discount rates reflect managements estimate of the return required from the business to reflect the cost of funds plus an appropriate risk premium.
In 2007 this was determined from the Groups cost of borrowing and was estimated at 7.0%.
In 2008 the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC has been used as the basis for the discount rate.
This has been adjusted for risks specific to each CGUs cash flows.
The average pre-tax discount rate used is 9.0% range of 8.76% and 10.04%.
A tax rate of 28% has been assumed.
Based on the value in use calculations performed no impairment of any of the cash generating units is required.
A summary of the key assumptions applied to each CGU is set out in the table below: Growth in Gross profit Growth in direct costs Growth in max long payroll max long term range term %%%%% Offshore Oil Services Scan Tech Norway 8 5 4-5 8 5 Offshore 5-6 5 3-5 5-6 5 Specialist Technical Services Nuclear 6 5 3-8 6 5 Fendercare 7 5 4-5 7 5 Strainstall 9 5 2-15 9 5 Marine Oil Services Cattedown 3 2 4-5 3 2 Sensitivity to impairment In order to assess the likelihood of impairment, the impairment calculations have been re-performed assuming a reduced long term growth rate of 2%.
There continued to be no requirement for an impairment provision at this level.
Impairment testing has also been performed by adjusting the discount rate based on the WACC to 15%.
No requirement for an impairment provision was identified.

25 Retirement benefit obligations The Retirement benefit obligations included in the Group and Company balance sheets relate to three defined benefit schemes operated by the Group, being The James Fisher and Sons Public Limited Company Pension Fund for Shore Staff, Shore Staff : The James Fisher and Sons Public Limited Company Pension Fund for Permanent Dockworkers, Dockworkers and the The Everard Group Pension Fund Everard, together with the Groups obligations to the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund MNOPF, an industry wide scheme which is also accounted for as a defined benefit scheme.
The Company has obligations under the Shore Staff and Dockworkers schemes and under the MNOPF scheme, the balance of which relates to its subsidiary, FT Everard & Sons.
As required by IAS 19 the valuations of the schemes have been updated to 31 December 2008 by qualified actuaries using agreed assumptions consistent with those used in 2007 except where stated in the table of assumptions included below.
The Groups assets and obligations in respect of its pension schemes at 31 December 2008 were as follows: Assets Group Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 Shore staff pension scheme 528 528 528 528 Obligations Group Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 Shore staff pension scheme 3,259 3,259 Dockworkers pension scheme 1,806 916 1,806 916 Everard Group pension scheme 1,684 MNOPF pension scheme 9,333 10,988 4,810 5,662 16,082 11,904 9,875 6,578 71 114650 James Fisher R&A Pt8.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 72 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Details of the schemes operated by the Group are as follows: James Fisher and Sons Public Limited Company Pension Fund for Shore Staff This scheme is the Groups principal pension scheme of the defined benefit type with assets held in a separate trustee administered account.
This scheme was closed to new members in October 2001 when the Company changed to a defined contribution scheme for all new members.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified actuaries, HSBC Actuaries and Consultants Limited.
These financial statements incorporate the latest full actuarial valuation of the Shore Staff Scheme carried out as at 31 March 2007, rolled forward to 31 December 2008.
The Company is currently contributing 14.5% 2007: 14.7% of pensionable pay.
The Company reviews the position of the pension schemes at three yearly intervals.
The latest review was carried out in 2008.
The Company agreed with the trustees of the scheme to continue the existing contributions to the deficit recovery plan of 55,000 per month 2007: 55,000.
Contributions will continue at this level in 2009.
In 2005 the Company decided to close the Shore Staff scheme to existing members from 2010.
At this time members contributing to the scheme can transfer to a stakeholder scheme option.
During the remaining period the scheme remains open to existing members the rate of growth of pensionable salary reduced to a maximum of 1.5%.
In 2007 the Group recognised an asset of 528,000 in respect of the surplus in the Shore Staff scheme.
This was the amount recoverable from the scheme by the Group through reduced contributions and represents the value of employers service costs over the remaining period until accrual ceases in 2010.
Following the incorporation of revised mortality assumptions, changes in the commutation factor, changes in the valuation of investments and the discount rate applied to the pension liability as a result of the incorporation of the scheme valuation at 31 March 2007 and subsequent roll forward, the scheme is now in deficit.
The surplus arising in 2007 was calculated in accordance with the principles of IFRIC 14 - IAS 19 - The limit on defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction.
No adjustment to this amount is therefore required on adoption of this standard in 2008.
James Fisher and Sons Public Limited Company Pension and Life assurance scheme for Permanent Dockworkers The Group also operates a defined benefit scheme for dockworkers.
The scheme has no active members.
The only contributions made by the Company are in respect of the deficit recovery plan.
These financial statements incorporate the latest full actuarial valuation of the Dockworkers Scheme carried out as at 31 March 2007, rolled forward to 31 December 2008.
As a result of the review carried out in 2008 the Company agreed with the trustees of the scheme to continue the existing contributions to the deficit recovery plan of 20,833 per month 2007: 20,833.
The Everard Group Pension Fund FT Everard & Sons operated a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new entrants from 1 April 2004 and closed to future accrual from 1 March 2005.
Under a deficit reduction plan agreed with the schemes trustees, FT Everard & Sons Limited is making annual additional contributions of 286,000 for a period of thirteen years commencing 1 March 2005.
The fund is contributed to by more than one employer.
The other employer concerned is Everard Insurance Brokers Limited EIB.
As referred to in Note 30 the Group has agreed to guarantee the share of any actuarial deficit in the scheme attributable to EIB up to a value of 2 million.
The proportion of the scheme attributable to EIB is not separately identifiable however this is considered insignificant in relation to the scheme membership as a whole.
After taking this into consideration the Directors have decided to account for the scheme as a defined benefit scheme and the disclosures given in this note relate to the whole of the schemes assets and obligations.
At 31 December 2007 an actuarial surplus of 1,506,000 existed relating to the Everard scheme.
No element of surplus was recognised relating to the scheme as this is already closed to future accrual.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 1 August 2007 has been performed and the results, rolled forward to 31 December 2008, have been incorporated into these financial statements.
As a result of the incorporation of revised mortality assumptions, changes in the commutation factor, changes in the valuation of investments and the discount rate applied to the pension liability, the scheme is now in deficit.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 73 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund In 2005 the High Court established that former as well as existing employers will be liable to make payments in respect of the funding deficit of the MNOPF.
The Company was informed by the Trustees as to the level of annual payments it will be required to make into the fund over a period of ten years commencing October 2005 representing its share of the deficit disclosed in the initial actuarial valuation carried out as at 31 March 2003 of 194,000,000 as revised by the latest valuation as at 31 March 2006 in which an additional 151,000,000 deficit was recognised.
Following the acquisition of Everard in December 2006 the Group took on additional liabilities in respect of the share of the MNOPF attributable to FT Everard & Sons and its subsidiaries.
These liabilities are separate from those of the Company and are included in FT Everard & Sons and its subsidiaries.
As stated in Note 30 the Trustees have also indicated that they may make calls for further contributions in the future, if new deficits arise or if other employers liable for contributions are not able to pay their share.
In February 2007 the Group was notified that the Trustees are expecting a shortfall in receipts from members of approximately 10% of the amount requested.
As a result the outstanding deficit has been reallocated with the result being that the Company is liable for an additional 80,000 per annum payable in eight annual instalments from 31 March 2007.
An adjustment of 537,000 was included in the statement of recognised income and expense in December 2006 representing the fair value of this liability.
As a result of the last actuarial valuation of the scheme which was carried out at 31 March 2006, in August 2007 following the approval of this valuation of the scheme, the Trustees issued calls for further contributions.
As a result of these additional claims the total amount paid by the Group in 2008 to the MNOPF was 1,885,000 2007: 1,896,000.
Following further correspondence with the MNOPF additional small claims have also been settled in full in 2007 and 2008.
The Group is not aware of any further outstanding claims in respect of the MNOPF.
The Group has an annual commitment to make six further annual payments of 1,873,000 to the scheme, payable in two instalments on 31 March and 30 September each year.
Since the Company has no control over the calls for contributions made from the MNOPF, it has determined that the fund should be accounted for as a defined benefit scheme and its liability recognised accordingly.
The share of the Group and Company in the MNOPF as advised by the Trustees is Group 3.1% 2007: 3.1% and Company 1.6% 2007: 1.6%.
Information supplied by the Trustees of the MNOPF has been reviewed by the Companys actuaries.
The principal assumption in the review is the discount rate on the schemes liabilities which is 6.7% 2007: 5.8%.
As no current contributing members within the MNOPF are employed by the Group or any of its subsidiaries, the Group is not liable for future accrual: it is only liable for contributions to correct any deficit.
The liabilities attributable to the Group and Company are shown overleaf.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 74 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Actuarial assumptions The last actuarial valuations performed have been updated to 31 December 2008 by the Companys actuary, HSBC Actuaries and Consultants Limited.
The schemes assets are stated at their market values on the respective balance sheet dates.
The overall expected rates of return on assets reflect the risk free rate of return plus an appropriate risk premium based on the nature of the relevant asset category.
The principal assumptions used in updating the latest valuations for each of the schemes were: 2008 2007 %pa %pa Inflation long term rate after adjustment for short term fluctuations 2.6 2.9 Rate of general long term increase in salaries Shore Staff 1.5 1.5 Rate of increase of pensions in payment Dockworkers 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase of pensions in payment Shore Staff 1.5-2.6 2.9 Rate of increase of pensions in payment Everard 1.5-3.0 2.9-3.0 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 6.7 5.8 Expected rates of return on assets Equities 8.2 7.5 Fixed interest bonds 3.7 4.5 Gilts Corporate bonds 3.7 6.7 4.5 5.8 Other assets 4.9 4.5 Post retirement mortality: Shore Staff scheme Years Years Current pensioner at 65 male 20.7 20.8 Current pensioner at 65 female 23.7 23.6 Future pensioner at 65 male 22.5 21.5 Future pensioner at 65 female 25.8 24.3 Dockworkers scheme Current pensioner at 65 male 20.7 19.2 Current pensioner at 65 female 23.7 21.9 Future pensioner at 65 male 22.5 20.0 Future pensioner at 65 female 25.8 22.6 Everard scheme Current pensioner at 65 male 20.7 16.9 Current pensioner at 65 female 23.7 19.9 Future pensioner at 65 male 22.5 19.8 Future pensioner at 65 female 25.8 22.8 The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increase in longevity.
The current disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the balance sheet date, with future being that relating to an employee retiring in 2024, the average year of retirement.
Investments The schemes assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or used by the Group.
The expected rate of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to gilt yields.
The expectation is that the return from equities and corporate bonds will exceed the return from gilts by 4.5% and 3% per annum respectively.

qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 80 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses relating to all schemes recognised since 1 January 2004 in the Group and Company statement of total recognised income and expense is 12,370,000 2007: 4,575,000.
The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity of 12,800,000 in the Group and Company is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group and Company statements of recognised income and expense before January 2004.
Defined Contribution schemes operated by the Company The Company also operates defined contribution arrangements for employees who are not members of the Shore Staff fund.
The pension charge for the year for these arrangements is equal to the contributions paid and was 211,000 2007: 187,000.
Defined Contribution schemes operated by or on behalf of other Group entities Other defined contribution schemes exist in the Group.
The total charge for the year for these schemes amounted to 827,000 2007: 653,000.
26 Share based payments As noted in the Directors Remuneration Report, the Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Share Matching Scheme SMS in respect of directors and certain employees.
The Company also operates Save as You Earn SAYE schemes for eligible employees which are HM Revenue and Customs approved schemes.
Details of the operations of these schemes are set out below.
Executive share option scheme 1995 1995 ESOS Share options up to a maximum limit of four times base salary may be awarded to board directors and senior executives.
The exercise price is determined at the date of grant and may be no lower than the market price on the date of grant.
The options vest if the increase in the Companys diluted earnings per ordinary share over a continuous period of three years exceeds inflation and is at least 9%.
A failure to meet this target increase during the performance period causes the options to lapse.
The contractual life of each option granted is ten years.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
The last award made under this scheme was on 10 March 2003.
Share matching scheme SMS Board directors and senior executives may elect to invest up to a maximum of 50% of annual cash bonus in ordinary shares.
These shares are held by the Employee Benefits Trust for a period of three years from the date of lodgement.
At the end of this period the employee will receive the original shares plus additional shares equal in number to the original shares.
Should the employee leave the Company during the three year period the option to receive the additional shares will lapse.
No grants have been made under this scheme since 2004 and it is not anticipated that any further grants will be made in the future.
Executive share option scheme 2005 2005 ESOS Share options up to a maximum limit of 100% of base salary may be awarded to board directors and senior executives.
The exercise price is equal to the market value at the date of grant.
The options vest depending on the Companys total shareholder return relative to the constituents of the FTSE Small Cap index excluding Investment Trusts.
If performance over a three year period is in the upper quartile, 100% of the options will vest.
If performance is at the bottom of the median, second quartile 40% will vest.
The amount vesting will decrease on a straight line basis between the median and upper quartile.
If performance is below the median quartile no shares will vest.
A failure to meet these conditions during the performance period causes the options to lapse.
Following the passing of a resolution at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the comparator Group for awards made under the ESOS in 2005 and 2006 was extended from the original selected comparator group to comprise all the constituents of the FTSE Small Cap index excluding Investment Trusts.
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2 - Share based payment, this has been treated as a modification to the original grant of options and the fair value of the options granted under these awards have therefore been recalculated.
Details of the change in fair value of these grants are shown below.
All-employee Savings Related Share Option Schemes SAYE All employees, subject to the discretion of the remuneration committee, may apply for share options under an employee save as you earn plan which may from time to time be offered by the Company.
In order to comply with HM Revenue and Customs requirements an individuals participation is limited so that the aggregate price payable for shares under option at any time does not exceed the statutory limit.
Options granted under the plans will normally be exercisable if the employee remains in employment and any other conditions set by the remuneration committee have been satisfied.
Options are normally exercisable at the end of the related savings contract but early exercise is permitted in certain limited circumstances.
The performance period will not normally be less than three and a half years or greater than seven and a half years.
Awards were made under the all-employee Savings related Share Option Scheme in September 2008.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Share options up to a maximum of 100% of annual salary may be awarded to main board directors and senior executives.
The exercise price of the option is nil.
The options vest if the increase in the Companys diluted earnings per ordinary share over the performance period is at least equal to the rate of inflation plus 9%.
The contractual life of each option granted is three years.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 81 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 The expense recognised for share based payments relating to equity settled share based payments transactions is 651,000 2007: 587,000.
The Company has granted conditional awards in the form of options over shares or conditional rights to have shares transferred to certain employees under the LTIP scheme approved at the Annual General Meeting over 241,487 2007: 297,806 ordinary shares of 25p each.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of and movements in share options during the year.
In order to avoid distortion of the WAEP options having an exercise price of nil have been shown separately.
These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 6.27.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 6.52.
For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2008, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 7 years and 3 months 2007: 7 years and 6 months.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 2.76 2007: 2.48.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was 1.42 - 6.73 2007: 1.42 - 6.73.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 6.45.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 6.51.
For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2008, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 8 years and 6 months 2007: 8 years and 5 months.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 2.77 2007: 2.85.
The fair value of equity settled share based payments has been estimated as at date of grant using statistical models which will most appropriately determine the fair value of each type of scheme.
The Black Scholes Model has been used for the SAYE, SMS and the LTIP schemes, the Binomial model for the 1995 ESOS and the Monte Carlo model for the 2005 ESOS.

The Group is required to maintain covenant ratios in respect of net debt to earnings before interest and depreciation and amortisation EBITDA, net interest costs to earnings before interest EBIT and EBIT and operating lease costs to net interest and operating lease costs.
The Group has met its covenant ratios for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The directors have prepared forecasts of the cash flows for the subsequent eighteen month period which indicate that the Group will meet its covenant requirements for this period.
The Group manages its capital structure through maintaining close relationships with its bankers who provide the majority of funds used for acquisitions.
Capital is monitored by measuring the gearing ratio which is a measure derived from net debt divided by capital.
Net debt comprises interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Capital represents net equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
2008 2007 000 000 Interest bearing loans 108,264 91,069 Less cash and cash equivalents 16,859 13,221 Net debt excluding preference shares 91,405 77,848 Equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent 97,240 93,905 Gearing ratio 94.0% 82.9% The reasons for the increase in gearing over the previous year are discussed in the Chairmans statement on page 4.
A significant element of the increase is accounted for by the funding by the Group of the Singapore submarine rescue contract.
As shown in Note 3 the Group has invested over 14,000,000 in this contract to date.
As indicated in the exchange risk section of this note a further 4,589,000 has been debited to equity in respect of the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts in respect of this contract.
The contract is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2009.
The impact of the contract in 2008 is to increase the gearing by 18.5% compared to 4% in 2007.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Interest rate risk Foreign exchange risk Details of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, strategies and policies are set out on page 10 of the Review of Operations.
Further information on these risks is presented below and is included in other disclosures throughout these consolidated financial statements.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 85 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
These arise principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Group Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 Available for sale financial assets 1,370 1,370 1,368 1,368 Receivables 51,729 33,980 1,648 2,220 Cash and Cash equivalents 16,859 13,221 169 1,237 69,958 48,571 3,185 4,825 There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer and the industry and country in which each customer operates.
The Group has a number of large customers including Government agencies in the UK and overseas, major oil companies and other multinational corporations.
The ten largest customers of the Group accounted for approximately 46% of Group revenue 2007: 42%.
No single customer accounted for more than 8% 2007: 8% of revenue.
As referred to in Note 3, receivables for 2008 includes 13,569,000 due in respect of the Singapore submarine rescue contract.
This amount is expected to be received when the contract commences service in the first half of 2009.
New customers are subject to creditworthiness checks and credit limits are subject to approval by senior management.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
Trade receivables are non interest-bearing and are generally on 3 to 30 days terms.
At 31 December the value of trade debtors outstanding was: Group Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 Gross allowance Gross allowance Gross allowance Gross allowance 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Not past due 23,456 20,013 42 26 Past due 12,067 1,284 11,923 1,140 3 12 35,523 1,284 31,936 1,140 45 38 The Group establishes an allowance for unrecoverable amounts movements on which are as follows: Group Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 Balance at 1 January 2008 1,140 123 Exchange differences 29 2 Additional provisions 833 1,104 Recoveries 9 5 Write offs 709 84 1,284 1,140 The principal write off in 2008 relates to 503,000 provided in Fisher Offshore against a debt due from a customer in Mexico.
The debt was provided against in 2007.
No other receivables are considered to be past due.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages its cash resources to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they fall due but in a manner designed to maximise the benefit of those resources whilst ensuring the security of investment resources.
The Group forecasts the profile of its cash requirements on a monthly basis and ensures that sufficient facilities are available to meet peak requirements which occur at predictable times in the year.
qxd 26 3 09 5:51 pm Page 86 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Details of the Groups loans and borrowings are set out in Note 27 to the financial statements.
The Groups revolving credit facilities extend over several accounting periods and fall due for renewal in different accounting periods ensuring that the Group negotiations with individual lenders follow an orderly process which does not expose the Group the possibility of a significant reduction in available facilities in a single period.
As explained in the general information to the notes to the financial statements on page 38 the Group has two facilities maturing in 2010 on which drawings of 35,215,000 have been made.

The Groups principal transactional exposures are to the US Dollar and Euro.
The principal exposures arising from its net investment overseas structural currency exposure is to the Norwegian Kroner.
As explained in the Review of Operations on page 10, the Groups objectives in managing its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of borrowings and to retain some potential for currency appreciation whilst partly hedging against currency depreciation.
Gains and losses arising from the Groups net investments overseas are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Most forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
Forward exchange contracts which qualify as effective cash flow hedges are included at their fair value in the hedging reserve and in current assets or short term liabilities until the earlier of their maturity or the date the transaction to which they relate is recognised at which point they are transferred to the income statement.
Changes in the level of exchange rates will have an impact on consolidated earnings.
The following table shows the impact on earnings of a 5% strengthening in the exchange rate in the Groups key currencies against Pound Sterling.
The obverse movements would be of the same magnitude.
These amounts have been calculated by applying changes in exchange rates to the Groups estimated foreign investment in entities which do not use Sterling as their base currency.
