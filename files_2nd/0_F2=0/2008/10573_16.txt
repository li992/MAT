QXD 5 3 09 09:21 Page 108 Morgan Sindall Report and Accounts 2008 Significant accounting policies for the year ended 31 December 2008 Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the business review on page 7, under the historic cost convention except as modified by the revaluation of pension assets and liabilities and share-based payments and are in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional currency, and unless otherwise stated have been rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Under Financial Reporting Standard FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the basis that its consolidated financial statements, which include the Company and present a consolidated statement of cash flows, are publicly available.
Under FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures, the Company is exempt from the requirement to disclose related party transactions with entities within the Group where the Companys interest is greater than 90%.
The Companys accounting policies have been applied on a consistent basis throughout the year.
Certain comparatives have been reclassified to conform with the current years presentation.
In the 2007 comparative balance sheet, amounts of 40.9m previously shown as cash at bank and in hand are now classified as 122.4m and 81.5m as cash at bank and in hand and bank overdraft respectively and amounts of 10.2m previously shown as accruals and deferred income are now classified as provisions.
Significant estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revision to estimates or assumptions are recognised in the period in which revised and in any future periods affected.
The estimates and judgments concerning the future at 31 December 2008 and that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: a Taxation Judgments are required in establishing the Companys liability to pay taxes where tax positions are uncertain.
Details of deferred tax assets and liabilities are set out in note 6. b Accounting for the Companys defined benefit plan The directors engage an independent and qualified actuary to calculate the Companys liability in respect of the defined benefit plan.
In order to arrive at this valuation, certain assumptions in respect of discount rates, salary escalations, expected return on the plans assets and future pension increases have been made.
Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on published statistics and mortality tables.
As the actual rates of increase and mortality may differ from those assumed, the actual pension liability may differ from that recognised in these financial statements.
Assumptions used and full details of the Companys liability are set out in full in note 7. c Share-based payments Recognition and measurement of share-based payments requires estimation of the fair value of awards at the date of grant and for cash-settled awards, re-measurement at each reporting date.
Judgment is also exercised when estimating the number of awards that will ultimately vest.
Both of these judgments have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the profit or loss and in the balance sheet.
To assist in determining each awards fair value, the directors engage a qualified and independent valuation expert.
Estimation of the number of awards that will ultimately vest is based on historic vesting trends for similar awards, taking into consideration specific features of the awards and the current intrinsic value of those awards.
