The deferred consideration provision relates to the deferred payments arising until the year ending 31 March 2009 from the Sucralose realignment in 2004.
Payments are made to McNeil based on the achievement of certain minimum targets in respect of sales of Sucralose made by the Group.
Another feature of the realignment is that the Group receives amounts from the vendor, McNeil, based on sales of Sucralose tabletop products made by McNeil for ten years from the date of the realignment.
These receipts are only recognised in the periods in which they are earned, and were shown up to 31 March 2006 as a deduction from goodwill.
Since the elimination of goodwill the receipts are recognised in the income statement.
In the year ended 31 March 2008 7 million of receipts were recognised in the income statement 31 March 2007 6 million.
Restructuring and closure provisions primarily relate to the businesses which have been closed and to a reorganisation as a result of the disposal of the five starch plants in Europe which accounted for the majority of the charge and utilisation in the year.
It is expected that the provision will be fully utilised within the next four years.
Included within other provisions are amounts provided for claims under clauses in the disposal agreements of businesses disposed.
These provisions are expected to be utilised within the next few years.
