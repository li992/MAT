The future realisation of these investments is intended to fund environmental obligations relating to the closure of the South African coal operations, Rio Algoms, Samancors and Selbaies mines, and consequently these investments, whilst under the Groups control, are not available for the general purposes of the Groups.
Any income from these investments is reinvested or applied to meet these obligations.
The Group retains responsibility for these environmental obligations until such time as the former mine sites have been rehabilitated in accordance with the relevant environmental legislation.
These obligations are therefore included under non-current provisions.
