47 212833 DIAGEO REPORT P28-71 5 9 08 10:08 Page 48 DIAGEO | ANNUAL REPORT 2008 OPERATING RESULTS 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 CONTINUED Disposal of investments and businesses In the year ended 30 June 2007 a loss before taxation of 1 million arose from the disposal of businesses.
In the year ended 30 June 2006 gains before taxation on the disposal of businesses were 157 million, representing a gain of 151 million on the sale of the groups remaining 25 million shares of common stock of General Mills and a gain on the sale of other businesses of 6 million.
Net finance charges Net finance charges increased by 26 million from 186 million in the year ended 30 June 2006 to 212 million in the year ended 30 June 2007.
The net interest charge increased by 58 million from 193 million in the prior year to 251 million in the year ended 30 June 2007.
This increase principally resulted from the increase in net borrowings in the year and the increase in US dollar and euro interest rates.
Exchange rate movements reduced net interest by 11 million.
Other net finance income of 39 million 2006 7 million included income of 48 million 2006 19 million in respect of the groups post employment plans.
This movement principally reflects the increase in the value of the assets held by the post employment plans between 1 July 2005 and 30 June 2006.
Other finance income for the year ended 30 June 2007 of 7 million 2006 charge of 2 million includes income of 6 million 2006 charge of 2 million in respect of exchange rate translation differences on intercompany funding arrangements that do not meet the accounting criteria for recognition in equity.
Other finance charges of 16 million 2006 15 million in respect of the unwinding of the discount on discounted provisions were recognised during the year.
Other finance income in the year ended 30 June 2006 also included 5 million dividend income in respect of the groups interest in General Mills.
Associates The groups share of profits of associates after interest and tax was 149 million for the year ended 30 June 2007 compared to 131 million in the prior year.
Diageos 34% equity interest in Mot Hennessy contributed 136 million to share of profits of associates after interest and tax 2006 122 million.
Profit before taxation Profit before taxation decreased by 51 million from 2,146 million to 2,095 million in the year ended 30 June 2007, primarily as a result of increased operating profit in the year which was more than offset by the 151 million gain on disposal of General Mills shares in the year ended 30 June 2006.
Taxation The reported effective tax rate for the year ended 30 June 2007 is 32.4% compared with 8.4% for the year ended 30 June 2006.
Factors that increased the reported effective tax rate for the year ended 30 June 2007 were a provision for the settlement of tax liabilities relating to the Guinness GrandMet merger, lower carrying value of deferred tax assets primarily following a reduction in tax rates and the tax impact of an intragroup reorganisation of certain brand businesses.
The effective tax rate in the prior year was reduced following the agreement of certain brand values with tax authorities that resulted in recognising an increase in the groups deferred tax assets of 313 million.
Discontinued operations In the year ended 30 June 2007 profit after tax in respect of the disposal of businesses was 139 million.
This profit represents a tax credit of 82 million in respect of the recognition of capital losses that arose on the disposal of Pillsbury and Burger King and a tax credit of 57 million following resolution with the tax authorities of various audit issues including prior year disposals.
There was no profit or loss from discontinued operations in the year ended 30 June 2006.

Adjusting the reported tax rate for the provision for the settlement of tax liabilities relating to the GrandMet Guinness merger of 64 million, and a lower carrying value of deferred tax assets, primarily following a reduction in tax rates, of 74 million, and the tax impact of an intragroup reorganisation of certain brand businesses of 24 million, the group had an underlying effective tax rate of 25.1% on profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2007.
Adjusting the reported tax rate for tax exceptional items, the underlying effective tax rate for the year ended 30 June 2006 was 24.9% on profit before exceptional items.
ANALYSIS BY BUSINESS AREA AND BRAND The organic movements for the comparison of 2007 compared with 2006 are calculated using the same methodology as the organic movements for 2008 compared with 2007.

2 Transfers represent the movement between operating units of certain activities, the most significant of which were the reallocation of certain supply and other overheads from Corporate to the regions and the reallocation of certain prior year transaction exchange differences into Corporate.
Transfers reduced restated prior year operating profit for North America, International and Asia Pacific by 3 million, 5 million and 9 million, respectively, and reduced costs in Corporate by 17 million.
3 The exchange adjustments for sales, net sales, and operating profit are principally in respect of the US dollar.
4 The only acquisition in the year ended 30 June 2007 that affected sales, net sales and operating profit was the acquisition of the Smirnov brand in Russia, which was reported in Europe.
The other acquisition impacting on the calculation of organic growth in the period was the acquisition of The Old Bushmills Distillery Company Limited in August 2005.
Disposals affecting the period were the disposal of United Beverages Limited and Three Barrels both Europe, which contributed volume, sales, net sales and operating profit of 0.2 million equivalent units, 35 million, 17 million and 2 million, respectively, in the year ended 30 June 2006.
5 Exceptional items in the year ended 30 June 2007 comprise a gain on the disposal of land at the Park Royal site.
There were no operating exceptional items in the year ended 30 June 2006.

Price increases and mix improvement drove performance in North America as top line growth was achieved across spirits, wine and beer.
Smirnoff vodka had another strong year with volume up 5% and net sales up 10% as price increases have been implemented.
Smirnoff continued to benefit from the Clearly Smirnoff campaign and gained 0.2 percentage points of value share.
Johnnie Walker volume was up 5% and stronger growth of Johnnie Walker Black Label together with price increases on Johnnie Walker Black Label led to net sales growth of 7%.
Share was up 2.0 percentage points on a value basis with gains on both Johnnie Walker Red Label and Johnnie Walker Black Label.
New television advertising campaigns and successful on trade marketing programmes increased brand awareness and recruited new consumers to Captain Morgan resulting in share gains of 1.5 percentage points on a value basis.
Volume was up 6% and price increases on Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum were implemented, driving net sales growth of 9%.
Baileys had an outstanding year with volume up 20% and net sales up 22%.
This was driven by the national launch of Baileys flavours and by continued growth of the core brand.
Jos Cuervo delivered 1% volume growth and 3% net sales growth.
Investment has been focused around the super premium labels as this is the segment that is driving category growth.
As a result these grew by 20%, albeit off a small base.
Tanqueray grew volume 6% and net sales 9%, gaining 0.9 percentage points of value share in a declining category.
This was driven by increased media investment behind the Are You Ready to Tanqueray campaign and the introduction of Tanqueray Rangpur which was launched nationally in the second half.
Local priority brand volume increased 3% and net sales increased 8%.
Growth of Crown Royal and US wines were partially offset by a small decline in Seagrams VO.
US wines grew net sales 8% driven by strong growth of the Chalone wines.
Crown Royal volume increased 5% as the NASCAR team sponsorship was up-weighted for the 2006 season and the brand returned to being advertised on television in December following two years of limited presence.
Price increases were implemented on approximately 40% of volume and this, combined with the positive performance of the luxury Crown Royal Extra Rare, drove net sales growth of 9%.
Volume in the category brands declined 2%.
Growth of beer and reserve brands led to mix improvement and net sales grew 5%.
Guinness volume grew 4%, with net sales up 7% as a result of a national price increase on the brand.
Increased marketing activity was focused on Guinness Draught in Bottles leading to distribution gains and increased levels of visibility in retail.
Additionally, marketing spend on TV media was up.
Ready to drink volume declined 6% whilst net sales were down 1% as a result of price increases and mix improvement.
While Smirnoff ready to drink volume declined, innovation delivered mix improvements with the introduction of new Smirnoff Ice flavours and Smirnoff Raw Tea.
The continued growth of Parrot Bay Tropical Malt Beverages and Jos Cuervo Golden Margaritas also contributed to this.

Global priority brand volume declined 1% and net sales were flat as the decline of Smirnoff ready to drink and of Guinness was offset by strong growth of Johnnie Walker.
Performance in the global priority brands significantly improved during the second half with volume up 3% and net sales up 4%.
Smirnoff vodka volume increased 2% while net sales increased 4% following price increases in Ireland and benefiting from the premiumisation strategy in Continental Europe which focused on building the brand credentials of Smirnoff Red and Smirnoff Black.
With significant improvement in Great Britain, volume in the second half grew 6% and net sales grew 8%.
Johnnie Walker volume was up 4% and net sales increased 12%.
Volume growth was driven largely from Johnnie Walker Black Label in Greece and Poland and Johnnie Walker Red Label in Russia, Poland, Bulgaria and the Balkans.
Net sales growth was the result of price increases, up-weighted investment and a premiumisation strategy in Russia, Greece and Iberia.
Volume and net sales further improved in the second half, with growth of 11% and 24% respectively.
While Baileys volume declined 2%, net sales increased 2%.
This was driven by action taken in Great Britain in the first half to increase net sales per case and higher net sales per case in Russia as a result of the move to an in-market company.
Strong volume performance in Continental Europe and Russia and the launch of Baileys flavours partially offset the decline in Great Britain.
Both volume and net sales growth across Europe improved during the second half as volume increased 13% and net sales increased 17%.
J&B volume declined 4% and net sales declined 2%, primarily driven by the continued decline of the scotch category in Spain.
This was partially offset by growth in France and Eastern Europe.
Guinness volume declined 6% driven by the continued trend from on to off trade.
Price increases were taken during the year and net sales declined 4%.
Total ready to drink volume and net sales declined 12%, primarily driven by Smirnoff Ice in Great Britain, Germany and France.
Local priority brand performance was impacted by the decline of Gordons and Bells in Great Britain, as a result of the Christmas pricing strategy to increase net sales value to the trade and by a decline in Cacique in Spain.
This led to volume down 6% and net sales down 2%.
Category brand volume increased 1% and net sales increased 2%, driven by gains in Pimms and Blossom Hill.
Great Britain In the full year volume and net sales both declined 5%.
This reflects decline in the first half partially offset by growth in the second half.
As a result of a more focused strategy on core spirits during the second half, spirits accounted for a greater proportion of total net sales and the proportion of ready to drink and beer fell.
This resulted in second half volume growth of 6% ahead of net sales growth of 1%.
Smirnoff vodka volume declined 1% but net sales increased 1% as a result of price increases.
In the second half, a combination of focus on sales execution and brand building initiatives resulted in volume up 10% and net sales up 11%.
Baileys volume declined 25% and net sales declined 21% as a result of the Christmas pricing strategy to increase net sales per case to the off trade.
In the second half net sales were up 12% as a result of increased promotions.

This was broadly in line with the performance of the beer market in the United Kingdom.
However, positive consumer reaction to a new advertising campaign meant that Guinness gained share in the on trade and is now the number four beer in Great Britain.
Local priority brand volume declined 9% and net sales declined 8%, driven by Gordons and Bells.
Performance significantly improved during the second half with a 10% volume and 6% net sales increase.
Category brand volume increased 4% while net sales were flat as growth in Pimms and Blossom Hill offset declines in Piat dOr.
Smirnoff ready to drink net sales declined 14% in line with the segment.
Ireland The key driver in Ireland continues to be the trend from the on to the off trade.
For the full year, volume was down 2% and net sales were down 1%.
While net sales of beer declined 2%, spirits and wines outperformed in both the on and off trade with 4% and 7% net sales growth respectively.
Smirnoff vodka grew net sales 7% and Baileys net sales increased 2%.
In wine, Blossom Hill increased net sales by 37%, albeit off a small base.
Guinness volume declined 9% and net sales declined 7%.
The second half performance improved following increased marketing and net sales declined by 5%.
Net sales of the lager brands grew 3% driven by Budweiser with the support of the successful launch of Bud Light.
Iberia Volume declined 7% and net sales declined 2%.
This was primarily driven by Spain, where performance was impacted by a declining scotch category combined with changes in consumer behaviour following new legislation that increased drink driving penalties.
Price increases across both Spain and Portugal partially offset the impact of the volume decline.
J&B volume declined 8% and net sales declined 3%.
In the second half, volume and share performance improved as a result of investment in the off trade and price increases were implemented.
This combined with growth in J&B Reserve led to price mix improvement.
Price increases contributed to Johnnie Walker net sales growth of 4% while stock level reduction led to a volume decline of 2%.
The brand outperformed the scotch category in Spain with Johnnie Walker Red Label the only whisky brand growing within the standard segment.
Johnnie Walker Black Label became the number one deluxe whisky in Spain with share growth of 4.2 percentage points.
Local priority brand volume declined 10%, primarily driven by lower volume in Cacique down 8%.
Growth in premium variants and Cacique 500 and Cacique Origen, which both gained share, combined with price increases, did improve mix and net sales were down 3%.
Category brand volume was down 9% primarily because of the decline in low priced scotch brands.
Mix improvement was delivered as Diageos malt whisky brands grew strongly, albeit off a small base and net sales declined 3%.
Rest of Europe In Continental Europe focus on premiumisation with the relaunch of Smirnoff Black, reallocation of spending toward key brands and innovation with Baileys flavours drove volume up 4% and net sales up 5%.
In France volume increased 6% and net sales increased 2%.
In a competitive market, promotional activity for priority brands such as Baileys, Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker increased.
In Greece total industry spirit sales declined 2%, driven by a decline in the off trade of 5%.
In addition, the port strike during the first half and a decline in Ursus caused volume to decline 4%.
Net sales were flat however as a result of a premiumisation strategy and price increases across all categories.
Diageo continues to be the leader in whisky, with Johnnie Walker Red Label leading both the on and off trade.
Net sales performance in Johnnie Walker Black Label, Tanqueray and Cardhu were also strong, with increases of 25%, 39% and 14% respectively.
In Eastern Europe total volume increased 13% driven by Johnnie Walker Red Label, Johnnie Walker Black Label, J&B and Baileys.
Net sales grew 16% as a result of premiumisation, in particular the strong growth of Johnnie Walker Black Label and new routes to market.
In Russia volume grew 25% and net sales grew 63%.
The move from a distributor to a newly created in-market company in July 2006 drove an increase in net sales per case.
Following this move Diageos regional presence increased to cover 74 cities in Russia and marketing spend increased behind Johnnie Walker Red Label, Baileys and Captain Morgan.
The newly acquired Smirnov brand has shown a promising start.

Global priority brands drove overall performance.
Johnnie Walker which is Diageos largest brand in Asia Pacific, representing nearly a third of net sales, drove approximately 50% of the net sales growth in the region.
Smirnoff volume grew 23% responding well to increased marketing investment.
Price increases were also implemented in a number of markets and as a result net sales grew 31%.
Growth was driven by India and Australia as Smirnoff Experience events, promotions and in the case of Australia, the Clearly Smirnoff media campaign, increased brand awareness.
Johnnie Walker growth accelerated over last year as a result of brand building marketing, aligned to Johnnie Walkers Grand Prix team sponsorship, mentoring and PR events.
Johnnie Walker Red Label grew net sales over 50% in Thailand and in China net sales of Johnnie Walker Black Label continued to grow strongly.
Guinness performance was the result of a strategy to drive value.
Net sales increased 5% as price increases and the repatriation of Guinness from a third party distributor in Korea offset a volume decline of 5%.
Local priority brands grew volume 4% and net sales 6% primarily as a result of growth in Windsor in Korea.
Significant mix improvement was delivered in category brands with volume up 4% and net sales up 14%.
This was primarily driven by the growth of Benmore in Thailand offsetting declines in the lower priced Spey Royal and Golden Knight.
Ready to drink volume increased 3% and net sales increased 5%, driven by Smirnoff Ice in Japan which was re-launched in fiscal 2006.
In Australia, a decline in Bundaberg ready to drink was offset by new brand launches.
Marketing spend in Asia Pacific increased 22%.
This growth was driven by investments made in the high growth potential markets such as India and China, although the rate of growth in marketing spend in China has now moderated following the significant upweight in fiscal 2005 and 2006.
The growth in marketing was targeted behind priority brands such as Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff vodka and behind the launch of new brands in India.
In Australia volume increased 3% and net sales grew 4%.
In ready to drink net sales grew 1% as a net sales decline in Bundaberg of 4% was offset by growth in both Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff ready to drink variants, with net sales up 12% and 5% respectively.
Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff net sales growth was driven by new line extensions and formats.
In spirits Diageo outperformed the spirits category.

Windsor continued to perform strongly, driving overall performance as net sales grew 15%.
Diageo has outperformed the growing whisky category and therefore extended its leadership position with Windsor now the number one scotch brand in Korea.
Positive brand mix was delivered as the growth of Windsor more than offset the decline of Dimple and this, combined with price increases and the repatriation of Guinness from a third party distributor, drove net sales growth ahead of volume growth.
During the year Diageo Korea and several employees were subject to investigations regarding various regulatory and control matters.
In Japan volume declined 1%, while net sales grew 8%.
Volume performance continued to be impacted by the decline in the scotch category while the growth of Smirnoff Ice following the relaunch drove mix improvement.
Although share has been lost in the standard and deluxe segments, Diageo has focused investment on the super deluxe brands and delivered growth significantly ahead of the segment.
In Thailand while the whisky category declined, Diageo continued to outperform.
Volume was up 4% and net sales were significantly ahead, up 21%, driven by Diageos strategy to drive mix improvement and a reduction in excise duties on certain brands.
Diageo leads across premium, deluxe and super deluxe scotch segments and has increased its value share of the overall category by 5.4 percentage points.
Johnnie Walker Black Label gained further share in the deluxe segment whilst Johnnie Walker Red Label drove the growth in the premium whisky segment, with net sales up 54%.
In the standard segment, mix improvement has been achieved through focus on Benmore in preference to the lower priced Spey Royal.
Volume of Spey Royal therefore declined as did volume of Golden Knight in the economy segment.
In China volume grew 41% and net sales grew 61% as Johnnie Walker Black Label continued to take share.
In January 2007 Diageo made its first investment in the Chinese white spirits category through a minority stake in Sichuan Chengdu Quanxing Group Co Limited.
In Taiwan while the overall scotch category is in decline, the deluxe segments are in growth.
Diageos focus on the Johnnie Walker deluxe labels has resulted in volume up 1% and net sales up 4%.
In India Johnnie Walker is the leading scotch and continued to lead the growth of the category with volume up 30%, led by Johnnie Walker Black Label, up 41%.
In the year Diageo took steps to widen its participation both within and across categories, launching a number of new brands.
Haig was introduced to compete in the premium whisky segment and the joint venture with Radico Khaitan launched its first new whisky brand, Masterstroke, into the Indian made foreign liquor segment.
In the vodka category Smirnoff continued to gain share with volume up 37%, whilst Shark Tooth vodka was introduced into the prestige vodka segment and performed well on launch.
The introduction of these new brands resulted in a dilution of mix, however net sales still grew 36% on volume growth of 44%.
CORPORATE REVENUE AND COSTS Net sales were 75 million in the year ended 30 June 2007, down by 1 million from 76 million in the prior year.
Net operating costs were 109 million, down from 166 million in the prior year.
40 million of this decrease relates to the exceptional gain on the sale of the Park Royal land in the United Kingdom.
Excluding this exceptional gain, net operating costs decreased 17 million as a result of transfer of costs to the regions and there was an underlying reduction in net operating costs of 4 million.
