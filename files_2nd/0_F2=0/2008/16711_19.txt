36 Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant accounting policies General information Victrex plc the Company is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is Victrex Technology Centre, Hillhouse International, Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire, FY5 4QD, United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 30 September 2008 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 15 December 2008.
Basis of preparation Both the consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS and on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are measured at their fair value.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the consolidated financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of s230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part of the approved financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Details of significant estimates and assumptions are set out in note 25.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by Group entities.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and Amendment to IAS 1 Capital Disclosures were adopted during the year.
As these standards are concerned only with disclosures, their adoption had no impact on the balance sheets or the consolidated income statement.
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2: Group and Treasury Share Transactions was also adopted during the year.
There was no change in accounting policy and no effect on current or prior year results or net assets of the Group.
In the Company the cost of share-based payments is recognised in equity and recharged to those subsidiaries benefitting from the service of the employees to whom options are granted.
This recharge is accounted for by the subsidiaries as an expense in the income statement.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 was adopted by the Company during the year.
As a result the Company has restated its comparatives for the year ended 30 September 2007 resulting in an increase in equity of 3.8m.
A number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued during the period which are not yet effective, and accordingly the Group has not yet adopted.
The cumulative impact of the adoption of these standards is not deemed to be significant.
IFRS 8 - Operating Segments is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009 and therefore the Group plans to adopt IFRS 8 for the first time in the year ending 30 September 2010.
The application of IFRS 8 in the year ended 30 September 2008 would not have impacted the balance sheets or consolidated income statement.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
The application of the amendment to IFRS 2 is not expected to have a significant impact on the balance sheets or consolidated income statement.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2008.
Whilst the Group is currently assessing the impact, the application of IFRIC 14 is not expected to have a significant impact on the balance sheets or consolidated income statement.
Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any impairment in the value of the investment.
Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 37 Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing control.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Joint venture The activities of the Japanese joint venture were governed by a joint venture agreement between the Company and Mitsui Chemicals, Inc. Certain key management decisions required the co-operation of both parties.
The Groups share of profits less losses of the Japanese joint venture was included in the consolidated income statement on the equity accounting basis until it became a wholly owned subsidiary with effect from 30 March 2007.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Segment reporting A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
A business segment is defined as a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The Group has determined the primary reporting segment to be geographic as the Group is engaged in providing products or services within particular geographic environments that are subject to varying risks and returns.
Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operated the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the retranslation to balance sheet date exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which have the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: a Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: b Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at weighted average exchange rates and, c All resulting exchange differences, from 1 October 2004, are recognised as a separate component of equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value.
The method of recognising any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
For derivatives not used in hedging transactions, the gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
38 Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment Owned assets All owned items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
The cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Buildings 30 years Plant and machinery 10-30 years Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 5 years Computers and motor vehicles 3-5 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for continued appropriateness and indications of impairment, and adjusted if appropriate.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Any impairment provisions that arose during impairment testing would not be reversed.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded previously under UK GAAP.
In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1 October 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred unless it meets all the criteria to be capitalised under IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Should any impairment provisions arise during annual impairment testing, these would also be deducted from the carrying value of other intangible assets.
Other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment, to the extent that they are considered to have an indefinite useful economic life.
Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 39 Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis in order to allocate the cost over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Knowhow 10 years The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for continued appropriateness and impairment, and adjusted if appropriate.
Impairment The carrying amount of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and current and deferred tax, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the recoverable amounts of the relevant assets are determined.
Goodwill Goodwill is tested annually for impairment by reference to the estimated future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit CGU, discounted to their present value using risk adjusted discount factors to give its value in use.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets and groups.
Impairment losses are recognised if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its value in use and are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit or group of units on a pro rata basis.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Other assets For other assets subject to impairment reviews, an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads allocated based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
Income tax Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries except to the extent that they will probably reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
40 Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved.
Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the amounts receivable for the sale of goods and services, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue from contractual payments is recognised by reference to completion of a specific milestone in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements.
Royalty income is recognised when the amount payable is known.
No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs or the possible return of goods.
Rebates are accounted for as sales are made throughout the period.
Volume rebates are accrued based on the maximum amount due to customers based on annualised sales, unless it is clear that rebate conditions will not be met in a particular period.
Employee benefits Defined contribution pension plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Victrex has decided to take advantage of the option under IAS 19 Employee Benefits to recognise actuarial gains and losses through the statement of recognised income and expense as opposed to the income statement.
Ongoing actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Share-based payment transactions The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
Share-based payment transactions are recharged from the Company to those subsidiaries benefitting from the service of the employees to whom options are granted.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable and include employee service periods and performance targets which are not related to the parents share price, such as earnings per share growth.
The fair value of the options is measured by the Stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
At each balance sheet date the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Any failure to meet market conditions, which includes performance targets such as share price or Total Shareholder Return, would not result in a reversal of original estimates in the income statement.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and it has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.
Net financing income and expense Net financing income and expense comprises interest payable on borrowings, interest received on funds invested and charges on bank loans and overdrafts.

The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined using value in use calculations of the performance over a period of 10 years reflecting the Directors best estimate of the cash flows.
For the period beyond specific forecasts, growth rates similar to historical growth rates are used.
Risk adjusted discount factors have been used to discount the cash flow projections.
BDF is a key raw material for the vast majority of our products and associated downstream activities.
The carrying value of goodwill arising on the associated acquisitions is measured against the discounted future cash flow projections of the Victrex business as a whole.
The goodwill associated with the acquisition in March 2007 of the remaining 49% share in Victrex-MC, Inc is measured against the discounted future cash flow projections of our Japanese operations.
The value in use calculations are based on cash flows arising from operating results set out in approved budgets and forecasts, using a risk adjusted discount factor of 8%.
As at 30 September 2008, based on the valuations performed, the Directors concluded that the recoverable amount of the cash generating units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and as such no impairment provision has been made.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
It is not considered that a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used would generate a different impairment test outcome.
Knowhow The knowhow arose on the acquisition in December 1999 associated with the supply of our key raw material BDF.
It is being amortised over its estimated useful economic life and has approximately one year remaining to be charged.
The charge is recognised within cost of sales in the income statement.

Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including the following: Currency risk Company Victrex plc is an investment holding company and is not exposed to currency risk.
The Company has no forward exchange contracts.
Group The Group currently exports 97% of sales from the UK, and also makes raw material purchases overseas.
In addition, the Group includes a number of foreign subsidiaries.
As a result of these factors, the Groups financial statements are exposed to currency fluctuations.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on profits for 2008 is 5m.
Forward exchange contracts are used to manage this exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group hedges a proportion of sales, and occasionally purchases, denominated in a foreign currency.
The Board is responsible for setting the hedging policy which is detailed on page 22.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
The Group buys or sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts and swaps designated as cash flow hedges are as follows: Notional Carrying Notional Carrying contract amount and contract amount and amount fair value amount fair value 2008 2008 2007 2007 000 000 000 000 Current assets 22,594 855 49,234 2,137 Current liabilities 111,966 10,455 75,944 1,464 134,560 9,600 125,178 673 The fair values have been calculated by applying where relevant, for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward currency contracts with the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date.
The following tables indicate the periods in which cash flows associated with the maturity date of the forward foreign exchange contracts are expected to occur: Expected 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 Expected 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 cash flows or less months months cash flows or less months months 2008 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 2007 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Forward exchange contracts Assets 22,594 13,724 19,646 16,672 49,234 22,373 21,257 5,604 Liabilities 111,966 62,796 39,448 9,722 75,944 28,781 31,111 16,052 134,560 49,072 59,094 26,394 125,178 51,154 52,368 21,656 The Group occasionally enters into forward exchange contracts and swaps for which no hedge accounting is applied.
However, these items are not material to the Group.
Any change in the fair value of these items is recognised in the income statement.
Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 49 Credit risk Company The only trade receivables of the Company are amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings.
Group The Group manages exposure to credit risk at many levels ranging from Board approval being required for the credit limits of larger customers, to the use of letters of credit and cash in advance where appropriate.
Internal procedures require regular due consideration of credit ratings, payment history, aged items and proactive debt collection.
The Board receives a detailed breakdown every month of all significant credit limits, amounts due and amounts overdue across the Group and, in the case of the latter, the relevant action being taken.
Trade receivables can be analysed as follows: Group Group 2008 2007 000 000 Amounts neither past due nor impaired 14,202 11,748 Amounts past due but not impaired Less than 30 days 1,616 2,151 30 60 days 617 531 More than 60 days 578 240 Total past due but not impaired 2,811 2,922 Amounts impaired 663 426 Impairment allowances 663 426 Carrying amount of impaired receivables Trade receivables net of allowances 17,013 14,670 Trade receivables are considered to be impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are believed to be in financial difficulty or if any other reason exists which implies that there is a doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
No provision has been made in respect of the amounts shown as past due but not impaired as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable in full.
Movements in the allowance for impairments were: 2008 2007 000 000 At beginning of year 426 303 Charge for the year 192 138 Exchange adjustments 45 15 At end of year 663 426 The credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are established, international banks.
As at 30 September 2008, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was 9.4m 2007: 9.4m for the Group, whilst the largest mark to market exposure for gains on forward foreign exchange contracts to a single bank was 0.7m 2007: 1.7m for the Group.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
50 Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Liquidity risk The Groups objective in terms of funding capacity is to ensure that it always has sufficient short-term and long-term funding available, either in the form of the Groups cash resources or committed bank facilities.
The Group has sufficient funds available in order to meet its current funding requirements for both revenue and capital expenditure.
In order to further manage liquidity risk to an acceptable level, the Group has a committed bank facility of 40m, all of which was undrawn at the year end.
This facility was renewed in 2007 and expires in September 2012.
As at 30 September 2008 the Group had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 23,532,000.
Interest rate risk The Group has no short-term borrowings at the balance sheet date.
Although the Group does hold substantial cash balances its exposure to interest rate risk is not considered to be significant.
Price risk The Groups products contain a number of key raw materials and its operations require energy, notably electricity and natural gas.
Any increase or volatility in prices and any significant decrease in the availability of raw materials or energy could affect the Groups results.
Victrex strives to obtain the best prices and uses contractual means to benefit where appropriate and possible.
The Group has a significant degree of control over its supply chain which enables it to effectively manage the risk in this area.
Capital management The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Groups total equity.
Its policy for managing this capital is to maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure that the Group always has sufficient resources to be able to invest in future growth.
The Groups capital and equity ratio is as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Total equity 166,794 141,483 Total assets 223,361 193,450 Equity ratio 75% 73% Victrex plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 51 16.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees throughout the world.
The majority of schemes outside the UK are defined contribution.
The principal scheme operated by the Group is a funded UK pension scheme in which certain employees of subsidiary undertakings participate.
The scheme has two sections.
One section provides benefits on a defined benefit basis with benefits related to final pensionable pay.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 31 December 2001.
From this date new employees have been invited to join the second section that provides benefits on a defined contribution basis.

All options are settled by the physical delivery of shares.
The terms and conditions of all the grants are as follows: Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The Victrex 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme came to the end of its 10 year life in 2005.
The exercise price of the granted options is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant.
ESOS options are conditional on the employee completing three years service the vesting period.
These options are exercisable starting three years from date of grant only if the Group achieves EPS growth exceeding inflation by an average of at least 3% per annum over the three year vesting period.
These options have a maximum term of ten years.
All employees are eligible to participate in the Executive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee currently excludes executive Directors from participating in this plan.
Option awards are based on a percentage of basic salary, not exceeding 100% of salary.
The exercise price of the options is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant.
ESOP options are conditional on the employee completing three years service the vesting period.
These options are exercisable starting three years from date of grant.

The price payable for each share shall be a price determined by the Board, provided that it shall not be less than 85% of the lower of the market value of a share on the date of grant or the date of purchase.

Victrex Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Each year executive Directors can be eligible to be awarded options to acquire, at no cost, market purchased shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent of 100% of basic salary.
The awards have normally become exercisable between the fifth and tenth anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued employment and the Groups performance over the three year period commencing at the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
The extent to which an award has been exercisable is dependent on two independent performance conditions with 50% determined by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS : The TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 12.5% on a pro-rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance.
Notwithstanding these provisions, no shares will vest under this performance condition unless, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group over the relevant performance period and, The EPS element of an award will vest in full if EPS growth exceeds inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, by an average of 12% per annum or more over the three year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 10% on a pro-rata basis if EPS growth exceeds inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the period and is reduced to nil if EPS growth fails to exceed inflation by 5% per annum.

Acquisition of subsidiary On 30 March 2007 Victrex plc acquired from Mitsui Chemicals, Inc their 49% shareholding in Victrex-MC, Inc, the Groups Japanese joint venture, which is responsible for VICTREX PEEK sales in Japan.
As a result, Victrex-MC, Inc became a wholly owned subsidiary with effect from that date and was renamed Victrex Japan, Inc. Net assets acquired were as follows: Book value of 49% share Fair value acquired adjustment Fair value 000 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 35 35 Deferred tax assets 282 282 Inventories 1,981 940 1,041 Trade and other receivables 1,138 1,138 Cash and cash equivalents 651 651 Short-term borrowings 1,056 1,056 Trade and other payables 2,365 2,365 Net identifiable assets liabilities 384 658 274 Goodwill on acquisition 2,688 Total purchase price comprising consideration of 2,310,000 and legal fees of 104,000 2,414 Less total cash acquired 1,328 Less accrued legal fees 50 Net cash outflow on acquisition 1,036 The net cash outflow on acquisition for the Company excludes the total cash acquired of 1,328,000 and is therefore equivalent to 2,364,000.
The fair value adjustment represents the elimination of profit in stock, and the related deferred tax asset, on the stock acquired as part of the transaction.
There were no significant identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the transaction and hence the difference between consideration and the fair value of net assets acquired has been designated as goodwill.
The carrying value is justified based on the discounted future cash flow projections of our Japanese operations.

Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

In relation to the Companys property, plant and equipment, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using historical experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved.
Assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to a potential impairment of the carrying value of such assets.
No circumstances have been identified to suggest that this is the case.
Goodwill is reviewed annually to assess the requirement for impairment.
Other intangible assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to the conclusion that the carrying value of such assets is not supportable.
Impairment testing on goodwill is carried out in accordance with the analyses described earlier.
Such calculations require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors and long-term growth prevalent in particular markets as well as short-term business performance.
The Directors also draw upon experience in making these judgements.
Note 10 contains information about the assumptions relating to impairment testing.
