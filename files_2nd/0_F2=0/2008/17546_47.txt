Trade and other receivables continued Trade receivables can become impaired, generally when customers are in financial distress, before being considered uncollectible.
Trade receivables are considered impaired only after completion of collection processes designed locally to collect monies from slow-payers or, if earlier, when amounts are more than one year past due.
At 31 March 2008 the carrying value and estimated recoverable amount of trade receivables past due and impaired was 4.2 million 2007 - 4.3 million, after deducting the related provision of 59.3 million 2007 - 49.4 million for doubtful debts.
The ageing analysis of the 63.4 million 2007 - 53.7 million gross trade receivables past due and impaired is as follows: At 31 March millions 2008 2007 Up to 1 month past due 0.4 0.5 1 to 3 months past due 1.3 1.4 3 to 9 months past due 5.7 4.9 Over 9 months past due 56.0 46.9 63.4 53.7 The other classes of receivables do not contain impaired assets.
At 31 March 2008, gross trade receivables of 201.2 million 2007 - 181.0 million were past due but not impaired.
The ageing analysis of these gross trade receivables is as follows: At 31 March millions 2008 2007 Up to 1 month past due 50.4 48.0 1 to 3 months past due 61.0 59.5 3 to 9 months past due 74.3 61.5 Over 9 months past due 15.5 12.0 201.2 181.0 The credit quality of trade receivables past due but not impaired is assessed using a statistical approach to determine the historical allowance rate for each ageing tranche.
This allowance rate is then applied to the debt tranches at the end of the reporting period and a provision for doubtful debts recognised.
As at 31 March 2008 91.2 million 2007 - 102.0 million of the total provision for doubtful debts related to trade receivables that are past due but not impaired.
