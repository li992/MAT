A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy who need not be a member of the Company to attend, speak and vote instead of him.
A form of proxy is enclosed with this notice.
The completion and return of the proxy form does not preclude a member from attending the meeting and voting in person.
A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by such member.
To appoint more than one proxy, please sign and date the form of proxy and, if necessary, attach a schedule listing the names and addresses in block letters of all of your proxies, the number of shares in respect of which each proxy is appointed which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you and indicating how you wish each proxy to vote or abstain from voting.
You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise the rights attached to any one share.
If you wish to appoint the Chairman as one of your multiple proxies, simply write the Chairman of the meeting.
In order to be valid, the form of proxy and any power of attorney, or notarially certified copy thereof, under which it is executed, must be received by the Company no later than 2.00pm on 12 May 2009, having been returned by one of the following methods: either i in hard copy form by post, by courier or by hand to the Companys registrars, Capita Registrars, Proxies, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU: or ii in the case of CREST members, by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service in accordance with the procedures set out in the paragraph below.
To appoint a proxy or to give or amend an instruction to a previously appointed proxy via the CREST system, the appropriate CREST message a CREST Proxy Instruction must be received by the issuers agent ID RA10 by 2.00pm on 12 May 2009.
For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host from which the issuers agent is able to retrieve the message.
After this time any change of instructions to a proxy appointed through CREST should be communicated to the proxy by other means.
CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST Members who have appointed voting service provider s, should contact their CREST sponsor or voting service provider s for assistance with appointing proxies via CREST.

CREST members, and where applicable their CREST sponsors or voting service providers, should note that CREST does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message.
Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35 5 a of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights a Nominated Person may, under an agreement between him her and the shareholder by whom he she was nominated, have the right to be appointed or to have someone else appointed as a proxy for the meeting.
If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise such right, he she may, under such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
The statement of the rights of members in relation to the appointment of proxies in paragraphs 1 and 2 above does not apply to Nominated Persons.
The rights described in these paragraphs can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
The Company, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, specifies that only those shareholders registered in the register of members of the Company as at 6.00pm on 12 May 2009 shall be entitled to attend or vote at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time.
Subsequent changes to entries on the register of members shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
If the meeting is adjourned to a time not more than 48 hours after the specified time applicable to the original meeting, the time referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph will also apply for the purpose of determining the entitlement of members to attend and vote and for the purposes of determining the number of votes they may cast at the adjourned meeting.
If, however, the meeting is adjourned for a longer period, then to be so entitled members must be entered on the Companys register of members at a time which is 48 hours before the time fixed for the adjourned meeting or, if the Company gives notice of the adjourned meeting, at the time specified in that notice.
