Business review The Business review of the Group can be found in the consolidated financial statements and Annual Report and Accounts of the Company for the year to December 31, 2008, prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Listing Authority requirements, Shire Annual Report in the Chairmans review on pages 2 and 3: the Chief Executive Officers review on pages 4 to 6: and the Financial review on pages 7 to 35.
The Financial review also provides a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company and the Group as well as risk management objectives and policies.
On May 23, 2008 Shire Limited now known as Shire plc became the holding company of Shire plc the former holding company of the Shire Group Old Shire, a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales, pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Sections 895 to 899 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006 that was approved by the High Court of Justice in England and Wales and the shareholders of Old Shire the Scheme of Arrangement.
Pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement, Ordinary Shares, each having a nominal value of 0.05, of Old Shire Shire Ordinary Shares were exchanged for Ordinary Shares, each having a nominal value of 0.05, of Shire Limited Shire Limited Ordinary Shares, on a one-for-one basis.
As a result of the Scheme of Arrangement, Old Shire became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shire Limited.
The Shire Limited Ordinary Shares carry substantially the same rights as did the Shire Ordinary Shares.
The Scheme of Arrangement did not involve any payment for the Shire Limited Ordinary Shares.
The Company is resident for tax purposes in the Republic of Ireland.
Income Access Share arrangements During the period to December 31, 2008 Shire has put in place Income Access Share IAS arrangements enabling shareholders to choose whether they receive their dividends from a company resident for tax purposes in the Republic of Ireland or from a Company resident for tax purposes in the UK.
Further details in respect of the IAS arrangements can be found in Note 25 of the Shire Annual Report, and in the Scheme Circular issued by the Company on April 16, 2008 which is available on the Companys website, www.
Results and dividends A loss on ordinary activities before taxation of $42.7 million was recorded in the period.
Dividends paid The Company paid dividends amounting to $3.1 million in the period.
In accordance with IAS arrangements, the Company directed Old Shire to pay dividends totaling $7.2 million to those shareholders who choose to receive their dividends from a company resident for tax purposes in the UK.
Dividend policy The Company paid and proposed the following dividends during the period: A first interim dividend for the first half of 2008 of 2.15 US 1.08 pence per Ordinary Share, equivalent to 6.44 US per ADS, was paid in October 2008.
The Board has resolved to pay a second interim dividend of 7.76 US 5.47 pence per Ordinary Share equivalent to 23.28 US per ADS for the six months to December 31, 2008.
This is consistent with Shires stated policy of paying a dividend semi-annually, set in US per Ordinary Share.
It is intended that the first interim payment each year should be constant in US Dollar terms.
Dividend growth for the full year will be reviewed by the Board when the second interim dividend is determined.
Any dividend growth will come through increasing the second interim dividend in a financial year.
Capital reduction On June 11, 2008 the Jersey Court approved a reduction of the Companys share capital, and on June 12, 2008 the Company accordingly reduced its capital by $3.7 billion creating distributable reserves.

B ACCOUNTING POLICIES Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at historic cost less any provision for impairment.
Dividends paid and received Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognized as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
This occurs in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders, or in the case of an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.
Expenditure Expenditure is recognized in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.

Share-based compensation The Company operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options has been valued using option pricing models.

Deferred tax is recognized in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognized in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognized only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Related-party transactions Under the provisions of FRS 8 Related-party disclosures, as the consolidated financial statements in which the Companys results are included have been made available to the public, the Company is not required to separately disclose details of related-party transactions with other Group undertakings in the financial statements.
Pensions The Company contributes to personal defined contribution pension plans of employees.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Convertible Bonds On issuance of, or substitution from other Shire Group companies, of Convertible Bonds the Company bifurcates these Convertible Bonds into their debt and equity components.
The fair value of the debt component is estimated using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-Convertible Bond.
The amount allocated to the debt component is classified as a liability and subsequently measured on an amortized cost basis until extinguished on conversion or redemption of the Bonds.
The remainder of the proceeds from the issuance, or the fair value on substitution from other Shire Group companies, of Convertible Bonds is allocated to the equity component, which represents the embedded conversion option, and is classified in shareholders equity, net of any income tax effects.
The carrying amount of the equity component is not re-measured in subsequent periods.
C OPERATING LOSS The operating loss is stated after charging: 2008 $M Staff costs Salaries and wages 1.3 Social security costs 0.2 Pension contributions 0.3 Share-based payments to Directors 0.7 Directors fees 0.8 The Company employed an average of two employees during the period.

The Bonds may also be redeemed at the option of the Bond-holder at their principal amount including accrued but unpaid interest on May 9, 2012 the Put Option, or following the occurrence of change of control.
The Bonds are repayable in US dollars, but also contain provisions entitling the Company to settle redemption amounts in Pounds sterling, or in the case of the Final Maturity Date and following exercise of the Put Option, by delivery of the underlying Shire plc Ordinary Shares and a cash top-up amount.
The Bonds are convertible into Shire plc Ordinary Shares during the conversion period, being the period from June 18, 2007 until the earlier of: i the close of business on the date falling 14 days prior to the Final Maturity Date: ii if the Bonds have been called for redemption by the Company, the close of business 14 days before the date fixed for redemption: iii the close of business on the day prior to a Bond-holder giving notice of redemption in accordance with the conditions: and iv the giving of notice by the trustee that the Bonds are accelerated by reason of the occurrence of an event of default.

Capital reduction On June 11, 2008 the Jersey Court approved a reduction of the Companys share capital to take effect on June 12, 2008.
The reduction increased the distributable reserves potentially available to the Company at the time of the reduction to approximately $3.7 billion by re-characterizing amounts standing to the credit of the Companys share premium account as a distributable reserve.
The purpose of the reduction of capital is to create a distributable reserve which would be available to be distributed as dividends, at the discretion of the Directors of the Company, from time to time or for any other lawful purpose to which such a reserve may be applied including share buy-backs.
The reduction of capital was designed to create in the Company a level of distributable reserves similar to that previously available in Old Shire and to enable the Company to continue Shires existing dividend policy in a financially and operationally efficient manner.

The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk: liquidity risk: and market risk including foreign currency exchange risk, price risk and interest rate risk.
The Groups overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to economically hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury conducted within a framework of policies and procedures approved annually by the Board of Directors.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
As a matter of policy, the Group does not undertake speculative transactions that would increase currency or interest rate exposure.
For further details of Shires risk management policies see the Business review in the Shire Annual Report.
Credit risk As at December 31, 2008 the Company had no cash or cash equivalents, trade receivables or derivative contracts and is not exposed to any credit risk.
Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
The Company finances its activities through cash generated from private and public offerings of equity, debt securities and committed bank facilities and borrowings and the repayment of loans from Shire Group companies.
The Company anticipates that its funding sources will be sufficient to meet its anticipated future administrative expenses, debt principal and service costs and dividend obligations as they become due over the next twelve months.
The current financial situation which is affecting the banking system and financial markets, together with the current uncertainty in global economic conditions, have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets and a low level of liquidity in many financial markets.
As a result, the Company may not be able to access new equity or debt finance at the same level or cost as it has done previously.

Price risk As at December 31, 2008 the Company held no investments other than fixed asset investments in subsidiary undertakings which are held at historic cost less any provision for impairment.
The Company is not exposed to any credit risk.
Interest rate risk As at December 31, 2008 the Company held no cash or cash equivalents or any debtors or creditors which were interest bearing.
The Company had a short-term borrowing of $39.4 million from another Shire Group company, which is repayable on demand and is interest bearing at 0.5% above the US Fed Funds Rate.
Interest on this borrowing in the period amounted to less than $0.1 million and the Directors do not perceive that servicing this debt poses any significant risk to the Company given its size in relation to the Companys net assets.
The Company had debt at a carrying value of $983.6 million outstanding in respect of the liability component of the Companys $1,100 million in principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Bonds, due 2014 which were issued in May 2007.
The Company incurs interest at a fixed rate on the Convertible Bonds.
Market risk sensitivity analysis FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires a market risk sensitivity analysis illustrating the fair value of the Companys financial instruments and the impact on the Companys profit and loss account and shareholders equity of reasonably possible changes in selected market risks.
The Company has no financial assets or liabilities that expose it to market risk, other than amounts owed to Group undertakings of $39.4 million.
The Directors do not believe that a 1% movement in interest rates will have a material impact on the Companys profit and loss account or shareholders equity.
Financial instruments The table below sets out the Companys accounting classification of each class of financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values at December 31, 2008.

Capital risk management The capital structure of the Company consists of debt, which includes borrowings disclosed in Note K, issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Note M. The Company manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern and to ensure the Group has sufficient capital available to meet future funding requirements.
The Group had net debt, as determined under US GAAP, of $924.9 million at December 31, 2008 which is low relative to its market capitalization, and positions the Group to take advantage of any opportunities that might arise to develop the business.
Details of funding requirements are explained in the Liquidity and capital resources section of the Financial review in the Shire Annual Report.
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Guarantees The Company has guaranteed the external operating lease commitments of a subsidiary, in the amount of $121.6 million.
Multi-currency Term and Revolving Facilities Agreement In connection with the acquisition of New River, Old Shire entered into a Multi-currency Term and Revolving Facilities Agreement the Facilities Agreement with ABN AMRO Bank N. V. Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets Limited and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc the Arrangers on February 20, 2007.
The Facilities Agreement comprised three credit facilities: i a committed multi-currency five-year term loan facility in an aggregate amount of $1,000 million Term Loan A, ii a committed multi-currency 364 day term with a further 364 day extension option loan facility in an aggregate amount of $300 million Term Loan B and iii a committed five-year revolving loan facility in an aggregate amount of $1,000 million the RCF and, together with Term Loan A and Term Loan B, the Facilities.
Old Shire has agreed to act as guarantor for any of its subsidiaries that borrow under the Facilities Agreement.
On April 18, 2007 the Shire Group fully utilized Term Loan A of $1,000 million and Term Loan B of $300 million to partially fund the acquisition of New River.
In May 2007 Shire issued $1,100 million principal amount of the Bonds.
The proceeds of the issue were used to repay and cancel $800 million of Term Loan A and all of Term Loan B in accordance with the terms of the Facilities Agreement.
The remaining $200 million drawn down under Term Loan A was repaid on June 29, 2007.
On July 19, 2007, Old Shire entered into a syndication and amendment agreement in relation to the Facilities Agreement the Amended Facilities Agreement, which increased the RCF to an aggregate amount of $1,200 million, amended the covenant relating to the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA and syndicated the RCF between the following banks which have the following commitment: ABN Amro Bank N. V. $200 million : Barclays Capital, $200 million : Citigroup Global Markets Limited, $200 million : The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, $200 million : Lloyds TSB Bank plc, $200 million : Bank of America N. A.
$100 million : and Morgan Stanley Bank, $100 million.
The RCF, which includes a $250 million swingline facility, may be used for general corporate purposes and matures on February 20, 2012.
The availability of loans under the RCF is subject to customary conditions, including the absence of any defaults thereunder and the accuracy in all material respects of Shires representations and warranties contained therein.
The interest rate on each loan drawn under the RCF for each interest period, as determined by Shire, is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable margin ranging from 0.40 to 0.80% per annum, depending on the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA in the latest compliance certificate and LIBOR for the applicable currency and interest period.
Shire also pays a commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 35% per annum of the applicable margin.
The Amended Facilities Agreement includes requirements that i Shires ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA as defined in the Amended Facilities Agreement does not exceed 3.5 to 1 for either the twelve month period ending December 31 or June 30 unless Shire has exercised its option which is subject to certain conditions to increase it to 4.0 to 1 for two consecutive testing dates: and ii that the ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest as defined in the Facilities Agreement must not be less than 4.0 to 1, for either the twelve month period ending December 31 or June 30, and iii additional limitations on the creation of liens, disposal of assets, incurrence of indebtedness, making of loans, giving of guarantees and granting security over assets.
Upon a change of control of Shire or upon the occurrence of an event of default and the expiration of any applicable cure period, the total commitments under the Facilities may be canceled and or all or part of the loans, together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued or outstanding may become immediately due and payable.
Events of default under the Amended Facilities Agreement include: i non-payment of any amounts due under the Facilities: ii failure to satisfy any financial covenants: iii material misrepresentation in any of the finance documents: iv failure to pay, or certain other defaults under other financial indebtedness: v certain insolvency events or proceedings: vi material adverse changes in the business, operations, assets or financial condition of the group: vii certain US Employee Retirement Income Security Act breaches which would have a material adverse effect: viii if it becomes illegal for Shire or any of its subsidiaries that are parties to the Amended Facility Agreement to perform their obligations or ix if Shire or any subsidiary of Shire which is party to the Amended Facility Agreement repudiates the Amended Facility Agreement or any Finance Document as defined in the Amended Facility Agreement.
In connection with the Scheme of Arrangement, with effect from May 23, 2008, Old Shire entered into an accession and amendment deed dated April 15, 2008 between Shire plc, Old Shire, certain subsidiaries of Shire plc and Barclays Bank plc as Facility Agent the Accession and Amendment Deed relating to the Amended Facilities Agreement.
The following is a description of the material amendments to the Amended Facilities Agreement, affected pursuant to the Accession and Amendment Deed, which took effect on May 23, 2008, immediately prior to the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective.
Shire plc acceded to the Facility Agreement as a borrower and guarantor, and Shire Holdings UK Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Old Shire, acceded to the Facility Agreement as a borrower.
Old Shire ceased to be a party to the Facility Agreement as a guarantor although it remains a party to the Facility Agreement as a borrower.
The Amended Facilities Agreement was amended and re-stated in order to take account of the fact that Shire plc is incorporated in Jersey and tax resident in the Republic of Ireland, to exclude the Scheme of Arrangement between Shire plc and its shareholders from the mandatory prepayment provisions contained in the Amended Facilities Agreement, and amend the financial covenants contained in the Amended Facilities Agreement in order to ensure that if any amount of interest awarded in the TKT appraisal rights litigation differs from that provided for in Shires accounts, any excess or shortfall would be treated as if it had been provided for on a pro-rata basis in accounting periods up to the time of judgment.
This amendment was made to avoid a technical breach of the Amended Facilities Agreement in the accounting period in which the any judgment occurs.
Fees for the arrangement of the Facilities and ongoing commitment fees are borne by another Group company.
On November 7, 2008 Shire utilized $190.0 million of the facility.
The loan was repaid in full prior to December 31, 2008.
