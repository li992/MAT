This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
If authorised, it will be paid on 1 July 2009 to shareholders who are on the register of members as at 29 May 2009.
The total dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2008 will therefore be 4.955 pence per share 2007: 4.50 pence.
The total amount paid in respect of 2008 will be 56.5m 2007: 51.1m.

Defined benefit pension schemes The Company operates and participates in the Cobham Pension Plan CPP and the Cobham Executive Pension Plan CEPP.

The Directors of the companies involved in the Group schemes will continue to monitor the pension deficits and take advice from independent actuaries as appropriate.
The schemes have been accounted for as if they were defined contribution schemes and the charge to the profit and loss account therefore reflects payments for the year.
Contributions to the Group schemes for 2008 amounted to 0.3m 2007: 0.6m of normal funding and a special contribution of 6.3m 2007: 5.3m.
No contributions were outstanding at the end of 2008 or 2007.

The share option reserve relates to provisions made in accordance with FRS 20 for shares allocated to the Companys employees under the Groups share option schemes.
Where share options which gave rise to charges under FRS 20 have been exercised, the appropriate proportion of the share option reserve is transferred to the profit and loss reserve.
Contingent liabilities The Company has contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business entered into, for, or on behalf of, certain Group undertakings.
As the conditions of the above guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no contingent liability provision has been made at the year end.
Cobham plc has also committed, in connection with the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project, to invest 6.0m in the equity share capital of three companies and to provide additional funding of 18.1m in the form of redeemable loan notes by March 2013 at the latest.
