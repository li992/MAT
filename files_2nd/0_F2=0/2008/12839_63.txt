Financial instruments and risk management The company is not exposed to significant levels of financial risk.
The company does not enter into derivative financial instruments.
Financial instruments utilised by the company during the years ended 31st May 2008 and 31st May 2007, together with information regarding the methods and assumptions used to calculate fair values, can be summarised as follows: Current asset investments In accordance with FRS 25 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, unlisted investments are held in the companys balance sheet at cost because their fair value cannot be measured reliably due to the lack of quoted market prices.
Current assets and liabilities Financial instruments included within current assets and liabilities excluding cash and borrowings are generally short-term in nature and accordingly their fair values approximate to their book values.
Borrowings The carrying values of cash and short-term borrowings and current asset investments approximate to their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The financial instruments held by the company do not, either individually or as a class, create a potentially significant exposure to market, credit, liquidity or cash flow interest rate risk.
