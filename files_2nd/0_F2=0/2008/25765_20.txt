JPMorgan American Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 33 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st December 2008 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The disclosures on going concern on page 20 of the Directors Report form part of these financial statements.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off in the capital column of the income statement at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently, the investments are valued at fair value which is bid market price for listed investments.
Unlisted and restricted investments are valued at fair value by the Board.
In making its valuations, the Board takes into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains or losses on disposal are included in the income statement within Losses gains from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Transaction costs incurred on the purchase and sale of investments are also included within this caption.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is taken to capital.
Overseas dividends are included gross of withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital return.
Interest receivable from debt securities together with any premiums or discounts on purchase are allocated to revenue on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate of those securities.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
Stock lending income is taken to revenue on a receipts basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue with the following exceptions: performance fees are allocated 100% to capital.
management fees are allocated 20% to revenue and 80% to capital in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
expenses incidental to the purchase and sale of an investment are charged to capital.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise broker commission.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 11 on page 38. e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated 20% to revenue and 80% to capital in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
f Financial instruments Cash at bank and in hand may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Accounting policies continued f Financial instruments continued Other receivables and payables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The debenture in issue, bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative instruments are valued at fair value in the balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss as they arise.
g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included in the income statement as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
h Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to capital on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is allocated to capital.
i Dividends In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, final dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are approved by shareholders.
j VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
The basis on which it has been calculated is the partial exemption method using the proportion of taxable supplies to non taxable supplies.
Further information regarding VAT on management fees is given in note 5 on page 35.

This asset may be utilised in future years where there is an excess of taxable income over deductible expenses.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on page 17.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments are as follows: investments in US equity shares and a $ liquidity fund, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: a debenture issued by the Company, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations: and a forward foreign currency contract, the purpose of which is to manage the currency risk arising from the Companys investment activities.
a Market price risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market price risk is given in parts i to iii to this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
The Company has purchased sterling against the $ for settlement on 5th October 2011, matching the principal amount but not the maturity date of its 50 million debenture.
The counterparty to this transaction is The Royal Bank of Scotland.
The Company only hedges its currency risk in respect of the geared portion of the portfolio.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31st December are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
JPMorgan American Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 43 2008 2007 $ $ 000 000 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are monetary items 14,369 21,926 Debtors amounts due from brokers and income receivable 576 2,373 Cash at bank 2,877 23,380 Creditors 1,658 44 Forward currency contracts 52,319 38,137 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 36,155 9,498 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 331,144 312,297 Total net foreign currency exposure 294,989 321,795 The above year end amounts are broadly representative of the exposure to currency risk during the current and comparative years.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of profit after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and takes account of forward currency contracts which offset the effect of changes in currency exchange.
It assumes a 10% 2007: 5% appreciation or depreciation of Sterling against the $ which is a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened by 10% 2007: 5% against the $ this would have had the following effect: 2008 2007 000 000 Income statement profit after taxation: Revenue return 785 355 Capital return 3,616 475 Total profit after taxation for the year 2,831 830 Net assets 2,831 830 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses are broadly representative of the whole of the current and comparative years.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities and the level of income receivable on cash deposits.
The Company held no fixed interest securities at the year end and investment in fixed interest securities has not been material at any time during the year.
The Companys exposure to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when the interest rate is due to be re-set, is as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash at bank 2,899 23,748 JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund 14,369 21,926 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR and interest payable on overdrafts is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2007: same.
The target interest earned on the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund is the 7 day $ London Interbank Bid Rate 2007: same.
The 50m debenture, which the Company has in issue, carries a fixed interest rate of 6.875% until the repayment date in June 2018. iii Other price risk Other price risks include changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to other changes in market prices at 31st December comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Equity investments at fair value through profit or loss 331,144 312,297 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the current and comparative years.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk A list of the Companys investments is given on pages 14 and 15.
This shows that all of the investments value is in the USA.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However, it should be noted that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% in equity investments.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and includes the impact on the management fee but assumes all other variables are held constant.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2008 2007 Three Three months More than months More than or less one year Total or less one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year Debenture stock 50,000 50,000 50,000 50,000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Amounts due to brokers 1,658 1,658 44 44 Other creditors 822 838 1,660 1,018 1,018 Derivative instrument forward foreign currency contract 2,319 2,319 2,480 53,157 55,637 1,062 50,000 51,062 c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a transaction fails to discharge its obligations under that transaction which could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk The Company will only deal with brokers which have been approved by JPMAM and banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Limits have been set as to the maximum exposure to any one counterparty at any time.

Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and seeks to maximise income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate level of gearing.
The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 95% to 120%.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as investments, excluding liquidity fund holdings, expressed as a percentage of total net assets.
2008 2007 000 000 Investments excluding liquidity fund holdings 331,144 312,297 Net assets 293,678 321,470 Gearing 112.8% 97.1% Composition of the Companys capital 000 000 Debt: 50 million 6.875% debenture stock June 2018 50,000 50,000 Equity: Equity share capital 10,682 10,682 Reserves 282,996 310,788 343,678 371,470 The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This includes a review of: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: the need for issues of new shares, including issues from Treasury: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
