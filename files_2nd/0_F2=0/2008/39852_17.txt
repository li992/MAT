Debenture and bank borrowings are secured by fixed charges over certain wholly owned investment properties and by floating charges over the assets of the Company and certain subsidiary companies.
The Companys bank loan agreements allow for part of the facility commitments to be provided by way of overdrafts to the Company and certain subsidiaries, which are available throughout the term of those facilities.
At 30 September 2008, Group and Company bank loans included overdrafts of 2,233,000 2007: 2,087,000 which have been classified according to the maturity dates of the facilities under which they are made available.
Similarly, LIBOR loan tranches, all of which have been drawn for periods of less than one year, have been classified according to the maturity date of the facility under which they are drawn.
The additional facilities of 75 million are repayable between 5 and 10 years from the balance sheet date.
The availability of the Groups bank facilities is subject to granting security over properties of sufficient value to meet the loan to value ratios required under the facility agreements and certain other financial covenants as described in the Business Review on page 29.

The fair values of the Groups cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, interest bearing borrowings and trade and other payables are not materially different from the values at which they are carried in the financial statements.
Management of financial risk Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the creditworthiness of potential tenants prior to entering into contractual arrangements.
Where appropriate, tenants are required to provide cash rental deposits to mitigate the potential loss in the event of default.
Deposits held are referred to in note 15.
The Group has a large and diverse tenant base so that tenant credit risk is widely spread.
Provision is made in full where recovery of financial assets is, in the opinion of the Directors, uncertain.
The carrying amount of financial assets, net of provisions for impairment, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group holds minimal cash balances, utilising overdraft and loan facilities for its day-to-day cash requirements.
Where cash deposits are held, they are placed with one of the Groups existing facility providers.
Liquidity risk The Board keeps under review the Groups funding requirements to ensure it has sufficient bank facilities available to meet its commitments and extend its portfolio through investment and acquisition of additional properties.
The Groups policies regarding finance and its current financial position are set out in the Business Review on pages 28 to 29.
The availability and maturity of the Groups borrowings is set out in note 18.
The Groups bankers are listed on page 37.
Financial instruments continued Market risk Interest rate risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing financial instruments, and is the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates.
The Groups policy is to minimise interest rate risk through long term, fixed rate debt and the use of long term interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on a large portion of its floating rate bank debt.
As described in the Business Review on pages 28 to 29 the Board keeps under review the Groups interest rate risk in light of market expectations of future interest rate movements.
At the year end, in addition to its fixed rate debenture debt, the Group had in place fixed rate hedging in respect of 360 million of floating rate bank debt, at a weighted average fixed rate of 5.06% excluding margin.
