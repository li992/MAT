56 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 25 VAT on management fees In 2004 the Association of Investment Companies the AIC, together with JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust plc, launched a case against HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to challenge whether Value Added Tax VAT should have been charged on fees paid for management services provided to investment trust companies.
On 28 June 2007 the European Court of Justice delivered its judgement on the case in favour of the AIC.
Since then HMRC has accepted that the provision of investment management services to investment trust companies is VAT exempt and has acknowledged its liability to pay claims in respect of VAT borne by such companies from 1 October 2000.
The Manager Henderson Global Investors Limited has been in discussions with HMRC regarding the reclaiming of VAT borne by the Company on investment management fees that has not already been recovered by the Company from 1 October 2000 to 30 June 2007.
VAT has not been applied to investment management fees charged for periods since June 2007.
On the basis of the Boards best estimate at the time, the Company recognised 978,000 of VAT recoverable relating to the period 1 October 2000 to 30 June 2007 in the financial statements for the year ended 31 October 2007.
A provisional agreement has however recently been reached with HMRC, via the Manager, and in the light of this the Board now estimates the VAT recoverable for this period inclusive of interest receivable thereon will amount to approximately 1,500,000.
Hence an additional amount of 525,000 has been written back in these financial statements.
The Company is also, via the Manager, reclaiming unrecovered VAT charged on management fees for the period 1 January 1990 to 4 December 1996, following the judgement of the House of Lords in a case concerning the time limits applicable to VAT claims.
The precise basis, and therefore the amount, that may be recovered from HMRC is not yet clear but the Board estimates the VAT recoverable for this period including interest could amount to approximately 800,000.
Discussions between HMRC and the Manager with respect to this period are at a relatively early stage and in view of this, no write-back has been recognised in these financial statements.
As regards unrecovered VAT charged on management fees in respect of the period 5 December 1996 to 30 September 2000, there may be some possibility, albeit remote, of recovering such VAT plus interest.
