Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 11.
The group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The group has one reportable business segment and all goodwill is associated with that segment.
The recoverable amounts of the CGU is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
A discount rate of 10% has been used which is consistent with the rate used for determining the value of purchased intangibles.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on recent history and expectations of future changes in the market.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget approved by management and extrapolates cashflows for the coming ten years based on estimated growth rates.
For the purposes of this calculation management have used a revenue growth rate of 18% for year 1, 15% for years 2 to 5 and then 5% thereafter.
Fixed expenses have been assumed to grow at 1% for year 1 and then 5% thereafter.
Variable expenses directly linked to sales have been assumed to remain a constant percentage of sales throughout the forecast period.
The rates used above reflect historical rates achieved and expected levels for 2009 but then are prudently adjusted for subsequent years.
Having performed impairment testing, no impairment has been identified, and therefore no impairment loss has been recognised in either year.
The group has prepared a sensitivity showing zero growth throughout the ten year period and increasing the discount rate to 20%.
Even at this level no impairment is required to be recorded.
