They are considered to have an indefinite life as they can be renewed at minimal costs and therefore no amortisation has been charged.
Non-amortisation is supported by an annual impairment review.
During the year various trademarks and domain names pertaining to the Fopp brand were purchased for 0.1m.
These are considered to have a useful life of 10 years and amortisation is being charged over this period.
Goodwill of 71.0m arising on the purchase of Ottakars plc on 3 July 2006 has been capitalised.
The carrying value of the goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review so as to ensure that the carrying amount is not greater than the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is determined from a value in use calculation with regard to the portfolio of stores acquired.
The value in use incorporates cash flow projections based on budgets approved by senior management over a five year period.
The calculation of value in use is sensitive to assumptions made with respect to sales forecasts, gross margin and discount rates.
Cash flows beyond the five years have been extrapolated using a 1% growth rate 2007: 1%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant market.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10% 2007: 10%.
On the basis of the impairment review undertaken, no impairment of the capitalised goodwill was required.
The Company had no intangible assets.
