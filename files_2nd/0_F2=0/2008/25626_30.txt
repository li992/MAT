Employee information continued The Group's equity-settled share-based payments comprise the Restricted Share Scheme, Executive Share Option Scheme and the Sharesave Scheme.
"""Restricted Share Scheme"" for the purposes of this note includes awards made under the JLT Restricted Share Scheme, JLT Performance Share Plan 2004 and the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004."
IFRS 2 applies to grants made after 7th November 2002, the issue date of the original exposure draft.
LTIPs awarded to executives of operating subsidiaries have performance conditions relating to the growth in trading profit and profit before tax over a three year period from the date of the award.
In general terms the annual average growth must exceed the regional RPI by a margin of at least 2%.
"LTIPs awarded to Executive Directors of the Group in 2003 have performance conditions based on the Company's earnings per share ""EPS""."
For 50% of each award, EPS growth is measured over three years.
Full vesting occurs if average annual EPS growth exceeds inflation by at least 10% and vesting only starts if average annual EPS growth exceeds inflation by 2%, with pro rata vesting between 2% and 10%.
If the minimum EPS growth hurdle has not been achieved over the 3 years there is discretion to extend the measurement periods for a further year.

Under the Black-Scholes model if the dividend yield is assumed to be zero then the fair value will equal the share price at date of grant.
The volatility has been calculated based on the historical share price of the Company, using either a 3 or 5 year term.
All options granted under the share option schemes are conditional upon the employees remaining in the Group's employment during the vesting period of the option, the actual period varies according to the scheme in which the employee participates.
In calculating the cost of options granted, a factor is included to take account of anticipated lapse rates.
