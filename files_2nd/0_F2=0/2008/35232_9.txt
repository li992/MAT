Group and company equity-settled option scheme No options were granted during 2008 or 2007.
Group cash-settled option scheme All options relating to the cash-settled option scheme arose as a result of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc see note 21.
A binomial lattice pricing model was used to value the cash-settled options.
The closing share price at 31st December 2008 of 7.25 2007: 14.14 and a dividend yield of 3% 2007: 3% were used together with risk free interest rates of between 1.7% and 2.6% 2007: between 4.4% and 4.8% depending on the term of the options.
Due to the small number of individuals who have been granted these options, an assumption of zero employee turnover has been made.
27% p. a. and 25% p. a. have been used for options with lives of one year, three years and five years and over respectively.
In general, the value of an option is affected by how quickly employees are assumed to exercise their awards after vesting.
In this case, however, given the other assumptions, the share price at the 31st December 2008, and the fact that the expected lives of the options are relatively short, the fair values are not sensitive to this assumption.
It has been assumed that employees try to maximise their returns and therefore do not exercise their options immediately, but tend to exercise their options later at the financially optimal date.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the financial statements 39 15 Pension costs The group operates a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme.
The latter was acquired as part of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc and is closed to new members.
All new employees will join the defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the pension schemes are held separately from those of the group companies.
Defined contribution plan The group and company operate a defined contribution pension plan.
The total expense relating to this plan in the current year was 0.7m 2007: 0.7m.
Defined benefit plan The defined benefit plan was transferred to the company from another group subsidiary at 1st January 2008 and therefore the 2007 information below relates only to the group and not the company.
The defined benefit scheme, which is contributory for members, provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and contributions are invested in a Managed Fund Policy with Phoenix Life Limited and F&C Investments plus annuity policies held in the name of the Trustees.
The pension charge for the defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
The most important assumptions made in connection with the establishment of this charge were that the return on the fund will be 6.75% p. a.
2007: 7.3% p. a. and that salaries with be increased at 4.4% p. a.
The market value of assets of the scheme at 31st December 2008 was 8.7m 2007: 11.6m and the actuarial value of those assets on an ongoing basis represented 113% 2007: 132% of the benefit of 7.7m 2007: 8.8m that had accrued to members allowing for expected future increases in earnings.

The overall expected return on plan assets is derived as the weighted average of the long-term expected returns from each of the main asset classes.
The long-term expected rate of return on cash is determined by reference to gilt rates at the balance sheet dates.
The long-term expected return on bonds is determined by reference to corporate bond yields at the balance sheet date.
The long-term expected rates of return on equities and property are based on the rate of return on bonds with allowance for outperformance.

A review for impairment of the investment in subsidiaries was carried out in accordance with IAS 36 on both value in use and fair value less costs to sell bases.
The companys accounting policy is to carry investments in subsidiary undertakings at the lower of cost and net asset value and recognise any impairment in the income statement.
In the opinion of the directors, the most appropriate estimate of the recoverable amount is the net asset value of the subsidiaries.
In view of the fall in the value of the investment properties, there has been a related reduction in the net asset value of the subsidiaries which has been reflected as an impairment in the company income statement of 336.3m 2007: 200.3m.

entire excess amount of consideration above the net assets acquired of 353.3m was allocated to goodwill.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the financial statements 48 21 Acquisition of subsidiaries continued The impairment tests carried out at an individual property cash generating unit level indicated that the carrying values of the properties were not impaired on an individual basis.
However, because the fair value of the group no longer supported the capitalised goodwill, the full amount of 353.3m was considered to be impaired and this amount was charged to the group income statement.
Details of the movement in goodwill and related impairments are set out below: m Cost At 1st January 2007 Arising on acquisition of LMS 353.3 At 31st December 2007 353.3 At 1st January 2008 and 31st December 2008 353.3 Impairment At 1st January 2007 Arising in year 353.3 At 31st December 2007 353.3 At 1st January 2008 and 31st December 2008 353.3 Net book value At 31st December 2007 At 31st December 2008 If the date for this acquisition had been 1st January 2007, then the group property income in 2007 would have increased by 4.6m.
As the fair value adjustments and adjustments arising from the application of Derwent Londons accounting policies made above have not been made to the results of LMS for 31st December 2006 it is impractical to assess the impact on the profit for the year arising from a 1st January 2007 acquisition date.
The profit for the year ended 31st December 2007 of 100.9m, which is after recognising the 353.3m of goodwill impairment, included post acquisition profits of 203.0m for LMS.
A number of investment properties and assets under construction, included within property, plant and equipment, were disposed of as they were not consistent with the groups objectives and a disposal programme was implemented.
Details and explanation of the profits arising on these disposals is set out in note 8.

Therefore, at 31st December 2008, these properties have been recognised as non-current assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale.
At 31st December 2007, the directors considered that the disposal of the groups holding in Euro Mall Sterboholy a. s. see note 20 in the first half of 2008 was highly probable and, therefore, was not accounted for by the equity method, in accordance with IFRS 5.
This sale did not proceed and at 31st December 2008, there is no expectation of a sale in the next 12 months and, therefore the asset has been transferred back to investments.
The classification of the asset has no impact on its value and its results.

The eventual liability to national insurance is dependent on: the market price of the companys shares at the date of exercise: the number of equity instruments that will be exercised: and the prevailing rate of national insurance at the date of exercise.
A provision is made for the potential liability for cash-settled share options based on the valuation carried out at each balance sheet date see note 14.

Secured Bonds 2026 On acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc on 1st February 2007 see note 21, the Secured Bonds 2026 were included at fair value less acquisition costs.
This difference from its principal value is being amortised through the income statement.
The fair value shown in note 29 was determined by the mid-price of 89.36 per 100.00 as at 31st December 2008 2007: 108.58 per 100.00.
Hedged debt The hedged debt consists of interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps represents the net present value of the difference between the contracted fixed rates and the fixed rates payable if the swaps were to be replaced on 31st December 2008 for the period to the contracted expiry dates.
The fair value of the interest rate cap represents the net cost of replacement on identical terms at prices prevailing on 31st December 2008.
