For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted for the impact of dilutive share options.
During the year the Company paid a special dividend of 74.4m and at the same time carried out a consolidation of its share capital.
These transactions were conditional on each other.
They were specifically designed to achieve the same overall effect on the Companys capital structure as a buy back of shares in a way in which all shareholders could participate.
Accordingly, earnings per share is presented on the basis that in substance a share buy back has occurred.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

For all other intangible assets an impairment test is performed whenever an indicator of impairment exists.
In the year ended 29 March 2008, no impairment charges were recognised.
The estimates of recoverable amount were based on value-in-use calculations using a post-tax discount rate of 10 per cent.
These calculations use cash flow projections covering a five year period based on the financial budget for 2008 2009.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated assuming a growth rate of 3 per cent.
The growth rate used does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the manufacturing business in which the CGU operates.
The discount rates used are post-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.

15 Financial Instruments Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board has established the Risk Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Groups risk management policies.
The Committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group Treasury Department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
The Group Treasury Department provides written principles for overall risk management as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
72 fide La Rue Annual Report 2008 Notes to the Accounts continued 15 Financial Instruments continued The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the result of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
Geographically, there is no concentration of credit risk and the value of the Groups revenue attributable to sales transactions with any one customer is not significant.
The Group has established a credit policy that ensures that wholesale sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group has a policy to procure mobilisation payments during order negotiation which further reduces credit risk.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit-quality financial institutions and the Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar, Euro, Swedish Kroner and the UK pound.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each foreign exchange contracts transacting with financial institutions.
The Groups risk management policy aims to hedge firm commitments and between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of forecast exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months.
Forecast transactions must be highly probable for hedge accounting purposes.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings denomination in the relevant foreign currencies and through foreign currency swaps.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of Directors monitors earnings per share, which the Group defines as the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The Board also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Groups strong cash generative characteristics and ungeared balance sheet have given the Board scope to regularly return to shareholders surplus cash flow through a combination of progressive dividends, share buy backs and special dividends.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year and the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

75 fide La Rue Annual Report 2008 15 Financial Instruments continued Cash Management Swaps In addition to currency swaps for net investments, the Group also uses currency swaps to manage the level of borrowings in foreign currencies.
The fair value of cash management currency swaps at 29 March 2008 was 0.7m 2007 : 0.1 m. The principal amounts outstanding under cash management currency swaps are US Dollars 10.6m, Euro 14.7m, Swedish Krona 605m, Canadian Dollar 3.4m, Singapore Dollar 0.9 m, Hong Kong Dollar 0.55 m and South African Rand 11.0m.
Embedded derivatives Embedded derivatives relate to revenue and purchase contracts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the customer supplier, or a currency that is not deemed to be a commonly used currency of the country in which the customer supplier is based.
The fair value of embedded derivatives at 29 March 2008 was 7.0m 2007 : 1.3 m. Currency risk Exposure to currency risk The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts: Some of the Groups net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Groups policy is to limit the translation exposure and resulting impact on equity by borrowing and or using forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the translation exposure in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets.
At 29 March 2008 there were no material currency exposures after accounting for the effect of the hedging transactions.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the respective functional currencies of the Groups operations and so transaction exposures are limited.
However, where they do occur the Groups policy is to hedge firm commitments as soon as they are committed using forward foreign exchange contracts and these are designated as a cash flow hedge.
In addition it is the Groups policy to hedge between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of forecast exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months.
For the year ended 29 March 2008 all foreign exchange cash flow hedges were effective with a 1.6m gain recognised in equity.

77 fide La Rue Annual Report 2008 15 Financial Instruments continued Derivatives The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by using valuation techniques.
In estimating fair values, the Group makes assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Non-derivative financial liabilities Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on LIBOR in the relevant currencies and were as follows: 2008 2007 Leases 5.70% 5.70% 16 Cash and Cash Equivalents 2008 2007 m m Cash at bank and in hand 49.9 40.3 Short term bank deposits 70.4 108.8 120.3 149.1 The effective interest rate on short-term bank deposits was 5.1% 2007 : 5.1% and the deposits had an average maturity period of 13 days.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise deferred income tax assets of 7.1m 2007 : 6.7m in respect of losses amounting to 26.9m 2007 : 17.9m that can be carried forward against future taxable income.
Deferred income tax liabilities of 103.8m 2007 : 99.4m have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries.
Such amounts are permanently reinvested.
Unremitted earnings totalled 435.2m at 29 March 2008 2007 : 360.1m.
UK capital losses of 382m are carried forward at 29 March 2008.
On 12 March 2008, the Government announced the intention to phase out Industrial buildings allowances with effect from 1 April 2008.
This change has not been reflected in these financial statements at 29 March 2008 because it is not substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
An estimate of the financial effect of this change, based on 29 Mach 2008 balances, is that it would reduce the deferred tax asset by 1.0m to 24.3m.

Options are granted at a price equal to the average market price of a share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant with a performance condition based on the achievement of an earnings per share growth target.
The performance condition relates to the achievement over three years of a minimum of three per cent per annum earnings per share growth over the rate of increase in the retail price index.
If this condition is not met at the end of the performance period the options will lapse.
For grants of options before April 2004 retesting of the performance target will be allowed twice, on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date.

Under the plan, employees have an option to purchase fide La Rue plc shares at the end of each 12 month savings period at a price which is the lower of the value of a fide La Rue plc share either at the beginning or the end of the offering period, less a 15 per cent discount.
It is estimated that 50,460 shares will be required to satisfy the Companys 2008 2009 obligations in respect of employees savings under the plan as at 29 March 2008.
Market Share Purchase of Shares by Trustees fide La Rue Employee Share Ownership Trust The fide La Rue Employee Share Ownership Trust was established to administer shares granted under the various fide La Rue Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS and the fide La Rue Executive Share Option Plan ESOP or any other share option plan established by the Company to executive Directors and senior employees.
Bachmann Trust Company Limited is the Trustee.
The Trustee at 26 March 2005 held 4.1 million ordinary shares due for release to participants of the ESOS and ESOP and this was reduced to 3,690,000 following the share consolidation in August 2005.
The balance of the trust at 31 March 2007 was 1,744,151 ordinary shares and this was reduced following the transfer to option holders of 1,116,986 and a further share consolidation in July 2007, which reduced the remaining balance by 56,279 giving a closing balance at 29 March 2008 of 570,886 ordinary shares.
