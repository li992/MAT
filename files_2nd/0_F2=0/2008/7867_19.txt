Significant accounting policies IMI plc the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and applicable law IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 108 to 113.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 4 March 2009.
The following standards and interpretations were adopted by the Group during 2008: IFRS8 Operating Segments The impact of adopting IFRS8 is given in note 3.
The following relevant standards and interpretations were issued but are not effective for the year ended 31 December 2008: Revised IAS23 Borrowing Costs removes the option to expense borrowing costs and requires that an entity capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset.
The revised IAS23 will become mandatory for the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements and will constitute a change in accounting policy for the Group.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Group will apply the revised IAS23 to qualifying assets for which capitalisation of borrowing costs commences on or after the effective date.
Therefore there will be no impact on prior periods in the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes addresses the accounting by entities that operate, or otherwise participate in, customer loyalty programmes under which the customer can redeem credits for awards such as free or discounted goods or services.
IFRIC13, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements, is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction clarifies when refunds or reductions in future contributions in relation to defined benefit assets should be regarded as available and provides guidance on the impact of minimum funding requirements MFR on such assets.
It also addresses when a MFR might give rise to a liability.
IFRIC14 will become mandatory for the Groups 2009 financial statements, with retrospective application required.
The effect of adopting IFRIC14 is not anticipated to be material.
Revised IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements 2007 introduces the term total comprehensive income, which represents changes in equity during a period other than those changes resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as owners.
Total comprehensive income may be presented in either a single statement of comprehensive income effectively combining both the income statement and all non-owner changes in equity in a single statement, or in an income statement and a separate statement of comprehensive income.
Revised IAS1, becomes mandatory for the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements.
Revised IFRS3 Business Combinations 2008 incorporates the following changes that are likely to be relevant to the Groups operations: - The definition of a business has been broadened, which may result in more acquisitions being treated as business combinations.
- Contingent consideration will be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes therein recognised in profit or loss.
- Transaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred.
- Any pre-existing interest in the acquiree will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
- Any non-controlling minority interest will be measured at either fair value, or at its proportionate interest in the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree, on a  basis.
Revised IFRS3, which becomes mandatory, if endorsed, for the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements, will be applied prospectively and therefore there will be no impact on prior periods in the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements.
Amended IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 2008 requires accounting for changes in ownership interests by the Group in a subsidiary, while maintaining control, to be recognised as an equity transaction.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, any interest retained in the former subsidiary will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
The amendments to IAS27, which become mandatory for the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements, are not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
66 IMI plc Annual Report 2008 64165 p61-p120 23 3 09 18:43 Page 67 Amendment to IFRS2 Share-based Payments Vesting Conditions and Cancellations clarifies the definition of vesting conditions, introduces the concept of non-vesting conditions, requires non-vesting conditions to be reflected in grant-date fair value and provides the accounting treatment for non-vesting conditions and cancellations.
The amendments to IFRS2 will become mandatory for the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements, with retrospective application.
The Group has not yet determined the potential effect of the amendment.
The annual improvements project to IFRSs provides a vehicle for making non-urgent but necessary amendments to IFRSs.
The 2008 annual improvements project makes amendments to a number of standards, these amendments were issued but not effective for the year ended 31 December 2008.
These amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group financial statements.
a Basis of accounting The financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the Companys functional currency, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except revenues which are rounded to the nearest whole million.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments: available-for-sale financial assets: and financial assets and liabilities identified as hedged items.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale, where applicable, are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the Group for the purposes of these consolidated financial statements.
b Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The nature of the markets in which the Group operates leads, from time to time, to a variety of possible legal and other claims from customers.
Whenever such matters are notified to the Group, they are investigated and any liability which results is recognised in the accounts as soon as a reliable estimate can be made.
Where it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of any future liability, a contingent liability is disclosed.
The Company has disposed of a number of its previous businesses.
The sale agreements contained various warranties and indemnities.
In some cases, the agreements also include the potential for adjustment to the purchase price, sometimes contingent on future events.
At the time of disposal, the accounts reflect the best estimate of the likely future impact of these agreements.
Estimates are updated at each reporting date to reflect the latest information available.
Information about other areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in the notes which follow, on Intangible assets: Deferred tax assets and liabilities: Financial risk management: Employee benefits: Share-based payments: Provisions for liabilities and charges: Contingencies: and Revenue.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities which the Company has the power to control.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
IMI plc Annual Report 2008 67 64165 p61-p120 23 3 09 18:43 Page 68 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant accounting policies continued d Foreign currencies i Foreign currency transactions Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translating transactions at the exchange rate ruling on the transaction date are reflected in profit before taxation in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated into Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
ii Foreign operations The income statements of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the appropriate average rate of exchange for the year and the adjustment to year end rates is taken directly to reserves.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly as a separate component of equity.
Since 1 January 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRSs, such differences have been recognised in the translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss.
e Financial instruments and fair value hedging Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, which follows the categories in IAS39: Fixed deposits, comprising principally funds held with banks and other financial institutions are classified as available for sale assets under IAS39, and held at fair value.
Short term borrowings and overdrafts are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost.
Derivatives, comprising interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and options, metals futures contracts and any embedded derivatives, are classified as fair value through profit or loss under IAS39, unless designated as hedges.
Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognised initially at fair value: attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition changes in fair value of such derivatives and gains or losses on their settlement are recognised in net financial income or expense.
Long term loans and other interest bearing borrowings are generally held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Where the long term loan is hedged, generally by an interest rate swap, and the hedge is regarded as effective, the carrying value of the long term loan is adjusted for changes in fair value of the risk being hedged.
Trade receivables are stated at their amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables are stated at amortised cost.
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet only when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Available for sale assets are carried at fair value with gains and losses being recognised in reserves, except for impairment losses.
f Other hedging i Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities, financial commitments or forecast transactions Where a derivative financial instrument is used to economically hedge the foreign exchange or metals commodity price exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, a financial commitment or a forecast transaction, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss resulting from changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in net financial income or expense.
68 IMI plc Annual Report 2008 64165 p61-p120 23 3 09 18:43 Page 69 For segmental reporting purposes, changes in the fair value of economic hedges that are not designated hedges, which relate to current year trading, together with the gains and losses on their settlement, are allocated to the segmental revenues and operating profit of the relevant business segment.
ii Hedge of net investment in foreign operation Where a foreign currency liability or derivative financial instrument is a formally designated hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign currency liability or changes in the fair value of the financial instrument are recognised directly in equity to the extent the hedge is effective.
The Company assesses the effectiveness of its net investment hedges based on fair value changes of its net assets, including relevant goodwill designated as foreign currency assets, and the fair value changes of both the debt designated as a hedge and the relevant financial instrument.
g Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions from 1 January 2004 is recognised as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
The asset recognised is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired entity and associated costs.
On an ongoing basis the goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Fair value adjustments are calculated at the earliest opportunity within 12 months of acquisition.
Unless stated otherwise fair value adjustments are provisional at the first balance sheet date after acquisition whilst the adjustments are finalised.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit acquired, or in the case of an acquisition of multiple cash generating units, goodwill is apportioned to each cash generating unit in proportion to the earnings multiple used for the business valuation at the time of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998 was deducted from reserves in the year of acquisition.
In accordance with IFRS1 First time adoption of IFRS such goodwill continues as a deduction from reserves and is not recognised in the income statement in the event of disposal of the cash generating unit to which it relates.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 January 1998 was previously capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over a maximum 20 years.
The unamortised goodwill under UK GAAP at 31 December 2003 became the opening goodwill under the Groups transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a minority interest in a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of the additional investment over the carrying amount of the net assets acquired at the date of acquisition.
ii Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised provided benefits are probable, cost can be reliably measured and if, and only if, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources and intention to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and directly attributable overheads.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy on Impairment.
Cost reflects managements judgement of the fair value at the date of acquisition of the individual intangible asset calculated by reference to the net present value of future benefits accruing to the Group from utilisation of the asset, discounted at an appropriate discount rate.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.

Significant accounting policies continued g Intangible assets continued iv Amortisation of intangible assets other than goodwill Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis unless such a basis is not aligned with the anticipated benefit over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets.
Amortisation commences from the date the intangible asset becomes available for use.
The estimated maximum useful lives are as follows: Capitalised development costs 5 years Customer relationships Life of the intangible asset up to 10 years Order book Period of the outstanding order book Other intangible assets Life of the intangible asset up to 10 years h Property, plant and equipment Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Costs in respect of tooling owned by the Group for clearly identifiable new products are capitalised net of any contribution received from customers.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis unless such a basis is not aligned with the anticipated benefit so as to write down the cost of assets to residual values over the period of their estimated useful lives within the following ranges: Freehold buildings 25 to 50 years Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years Tooling Life of related product maximum 10 years i Leased assets Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation see above and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
The majority of leasing transactions entered into by the Group are operating leases.
j Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all direct costs of production and the appropriate proportion of production overheads.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
l Impairment The carrying values of the Groups non-financial assets other than inventories see accounting policy Inventories and deferred tax assets see accounting policy Income tax, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
70 IMI plc Annual Report 2008 64165 p61-p120 23 3 09 18:43 Page 71 If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or all assets within its cash generating unit is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is evaluated at each balance sheet date.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the Groups receivables other than financial assets held at fair value is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate inherent in the asset.
Receivables with a short duration of less than one year are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows generated based upon the latest Group three year plan and extrapolated using an appropriate long-term growth rate in perpetuity consistent with long term GDP growth are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Management believe that this approach, including the use of the indefinite cash flow projection, is appropriate based upon historical experience and as this is one of the bases management utilise to evaluate the fair value of investment opportunities.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairment As required by IAS36 Impairment of Assets, any impairment of goodwill or available for sale financial assets is non-reversible.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if at the balance sheet date there are indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists following a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
m Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders or by the subsidiary shareholders in respect of dividends to minorities.
n Employee benefits i Defined contribution pension plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit pension plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds of the appropriate currency that have durations approximating those of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the net total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan and restricted by any relevant asset ceiling.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in profit or loss in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in equity and disclosed in the statement of recognised income and expense.
IMI plc Annual Report 2008 71 64165 p61-p120 Q6:Layout 1 24 3 09 15:55 Page 72 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant accounting policies continued n Employee benefits continued iii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on high quality bonds of the appropriate currency that have durations approximating those of the Groups obligations.
iv Equity and equity-related compensation benefits The Group operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, a SAYE Share Option Scheme, an All Employee Share Ownership Plan and a Performance Share Plan.
For options granted on or after 7 November 2002, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense each year.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
The fair value of the options is determined based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
o Provisions Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are valued at managements best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
p Revenue i Sale of products Revenue from the sale of products is recognised in the income statement net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and reliable measurement is possible.
No revenue is recognised where recovery of the consideration is not probable or there are significant uncertainties regarding associated costs, or the possible return of goods.
Transfers of risks and rewards vary depending on the nature of the products sold and the individual terms of the contract of sale.
Sales made under internationally accepted trade terms, Incoterms 2000, are recognised as revenue when the Group has completed the primary duties required to transfer risks as defined by the International Chamber of Commerce Official Rules for the Interpretation of Trade Terms.
Sales made outside of Incoterms 2000 are generally recognised on delivery to the customer.
ii Services Revenue from services rendered is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the service at the balance sheet date.
Installation fees are recognised as revenue by reference to the stage of completion on the installation unless they are incidental to the sale of the goods, in which case they are recognised when the goods are sold.
iii Construction contracts Revenue from significant machinery or valve contracts is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract by reference to the specific contract terms unless the contract contains discrete components separately transferring risks and rewards to the customer.
Where separate components are present revenue is recognised on each component in accordance with the policy on the sale of products.
72 IMI plc Annual Report 2008 64165 p61-p120 23 3 09 18:43 Page 73 q Financial income and expense Financial income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, assumed returns on employee benefit plan assets, income from investments and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the asset.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date that the dividend is declared.
Financial expense comprises interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, assumed interest on employee benefit plan liabilities and losses on financial instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
r Income tax Current tax represents the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into account any adjustments in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the timing of the reversal of the differences can be controlled and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on the tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
s Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Where applicable, on initial classification as held for sale, non-current disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on the initial classification of assets as held for sale are included in profit or loss, even for assets measured at fair value, as are gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business that has been disposed of, is held for sale or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale or if directly related to the disposal of a discontinued operation in a prior period.
Restatement The directors present adjusted profit before tax excluding restructuring, investigation costs and fines, acquired intangible amortisation and impairment, other income and financial instruments excluding economic hedge contract gains and losses to give a more meaningful indication of the Group's underlying performance because either the quantum, the one-off nature, or volatility of the excluded items would otherwise distort underlying performance.
In prior years the amortisation of internal development costs had also been excluded in the calculation of adjusted profit before tax.
Due to the importance of development to the Group, and in line with developing practice, development cost amortisation is no longer excluded from adjusted profit before tax.
Reported adjusted profit before tax is 3.2m lower in the year 2007: 3.0m for this item.
Additionally, due to the volatility of movement in financial instruments, as these instruments are held to provide stability of future trading cash flows and do not therefore reflect the underlying trading performance of the Group, gains and losses on financial instruments excluding economic hedge contracts have also been excluded from adjusted profit before tax.
Reported adjusted profit before tax is 19.6m higher in the year 2007: 1.6m lower adjusted for this item.
The statement of recognised income and expense shows items gross of tax, with tax on these items disclosed separately.
2007 comparatives have been restated accordingly.
IMI plc Annual Report 2008 73 64165 p61-p120 Q6:Layout 1 24 3 09 15:55 Page 74 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. Business and geographical segments The Group has adopted IFRS8 Operating Segments in these accounts.
Segmental information is presented in the consolidated financial statements for each of the Group's continuing primary operating segments.
The operating segment reporting format reflects the Group's management and internal reporting structures.
Comparative segmental information is presented on a consistent basis with the exception that information on economic hedge contract costs is not available for 2007 and the cost to develop it would be excessive.
Due to the relative stability of currencies in 2007 any impact is not considered to be material.
The Group includes the following five operating segments and activities: Fluid Controls Severe Service Design, manufacture, supply and service of high performance critical control valves and associated equipment for power generation plants, oil & gas producers and other process industries.
Fluid Power Design, manufacture and supply of motion and fluid control systems, principally pneumatic devices, for original equipment manufacturers in commercial vehicle, life science, print, rail, packaging and other industries.
Indoor Climate Design, manufacture and supply of indoor climate control systems, principally balancing valves for large commercial buildings and thermostatic radiator valves for residential buildings.
Retail Dispense Beverage Dispense Design, manufacture and supply of still and carbonated beverage dispense systems and associated merchandising equipment for brand owners and retailers.
Merchandising Design, manufacture and supply of point of purchase display systems for brand owners and retailers.
Information regarding the operations of each reporting segment is included below.
Performance is measured based on segmental operating profit before restructuring, Severe Service investigation costs and fines, acquired intangible amortisation and impairment and other income.
Segmental operating profit is also reported as if economic currency and metals hedges were effective for financial reporting purposes.
This measure gives a more meaningful indication of the underlying performance of the segments because either the quantum, the one-off nature, or volatility of these items would otherwise distort underlying trading performance.
Business segments enter into forward currency and metal contracts to provide economic hedges against the impact on profitability of swings in rates and values in accordance with the Group's policy to minimise the risk of volatility in revenues, costs and margins.
Business segmental operating profits are therefore charged credited with the impact of these settled contracts.
In accordance with IAS39, these contracts do not meet the technical provisions required for hedge accounting and gains and losses are recorded in net financial income and expense.

Acquisitions There were no acquisitions during the year.
The 2007 acquisitions of Pneumatex AG Pneumatex and Kloehn Company Limited Kloehn contributed 37m of additional revenue and 4.1m of additional operating profit in the year 2007: 15m and 1.8m respectively.
In 2007 the business of Kloehn, a leading US provider of specialist pumping and fluid handling systems for the life science sector was acquired on 29 June 2007 which is reported within Fluid Power, and a 70% share in Pneumatex, a specialist provider of water conditioning equipment for building heating, cooling and related systems was acquired on 28 September 2007, reported within Indoor Climate.

The goodwill recognised on the acquisition principally relates to skills present within the assembled workforce, customer service capability and the geographical and sector presence of these businesses.
The fair value adjustments principally relate to harmonisation with Group IFRSs compliant accounting policies, recognition of intangible assets which principally comprise the value of non-contractual customer relationships and the order book at acquisition and the reflection of adjustments to move the carrying value of the identifiable net assets from cost to fair value.

Tax rates in several overseas jurisdictions also decreased in 2008.
The effective tax rate on profit before tax is 34.1% after taking account of the provision for potential Severe Service investigation fines and related costs totalling 26.3m.
The effective tax rate before this based on profit of 202.3m and tax of 62.8m is 31%.
The reconciliation of effective tax rate has been restated to reconcile the Group effective rate to the UK tax rate as this is considered to be more appropriate for the Group.
Prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Earnings per ordinary share The weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, net of shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares or to satisfy share option vesting, was 319.3m, 321.6m diluted for the effect of outstanding share options 2007: 330.7m, 331.8m diluted.
Basic and diluted earnings per share have been calculated on earnings of 112.9m 2007: 117.0m and the equivalent ratios apply for continuing operations 2007: 115.1m before gain, net of tax, from discontinued operations.
The directors consider that adjusted earnings per share figures, using earnings as calculated below, give a more meaningful indication of the underlying performance because either the quantum, the one off nature, or volatility of these items would otherwise distort the underlying performance.

Management believe that the key assumptions on which the carrying value of goodwill is based are appropriate and any reasonable change in these assumptions would not lead to a materially different conclusion.
Forecast year 3 cash flows were extrapolated into perpetuity at a 2.25% growth rate which is considered to be consistent with the long term average growth rate for the industry.
Pre-tax discount rates of between 10% and 15% are applied in determining the recoverable amounts of cash generating units.
The discount rates are estimated based on the Group's cost of capital, which is calculated after consideration of market information, and risk adjusted for individual units circumstances.
No single cash generating unit represents a significant proportion of the total goodwill.
During the year, trading performance and order intake levels at Commtech part of the Indoor Climate business caused the Group to assess the recoverable amount of that business.
The recoverable amount, being its value in use, was estimated by discounting the business forecast cash flows at 15%.
Based upon this assessment the carrying value of the business was determined to be 6m higher than its recoverable amount and an impairment loss against the acquired goodwill of that business was recognised.
There were no impairments recognised in 2007.
The Group's estimates of impairments are most sensitive to increases in the discount rate used and the value of the third year's forecast cash flows which are extrapolated into perpetuity.
Neither a 1% increase in the discount rate nor a 50 basis point decrease in forecast cash flows would indicate any further impairment.
Depreciation for the year on these assets was 0.3m 2007: 0.3m.

Financial risk management Overview The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
As described in the Corporate Governance Report on page 44, this responsibility has been assigned to the Executive Committee with support and feedback from the Audit Committee and the IMI Group Assurance Department as described below.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The IMI Group Assurance Department undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Groups funding and liquidity as well as its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange and base metal price movements are managed centrally by IMIs treasury function.
Treasury uses a combination of derivatives and conventional financial instruments to manage the underlying risks.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers, cash and cash equivalents held by the Groups banks and other financial assets.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
Approximately 4% 2007: 4% of the Groups revenue is attributable to sales transactions with our largest single customer.
Geographically there is no unusual concentration of credit risk.
The Groups contract approval procedure ensures that large contracts are signed off at executive director level at which time the potential credit risks are reviewed.
Credit risk is minimised through cash flow management and the use of documentary credits where appropriate.
88 IMI plc Annual Report 2008 64165 p61-p120 23 3 09 18:43 Page 89 Counterparty risk A group of relationship banks provides the bulk of the banking services with pre-approved credit limits set for each institution.
Financial derivatives are entered into with these core banks and the underlying credit exposure to these instruments is included when considering the credit exposure to the counterparties.
At the end of 2008 surplus cash was deposited with the Groups banks with no single institution creating an exposure greater than 20m.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have adequate resources, to meet its liabilities when due, with sufficient headroom to cope with abnormal market conditions.
This position is formally reviewed on a quarterly basis.
Funding for the Group is co-ordinated centrally by the treasury function and comprises committed bilateral facilities with a core group of banks, and a series of US Loan Note issues.
The level of facilities is maintained such that facilities and term loans with a maturity in excess of 12 months exceed the forecast peak net debt of the Group by a preapproved level taking into account market conditions and corporate activity.
At the end of 2008 the Group had undrawn committed facilities totalling 154m 2007: 60m and was holding cash and cash equivalents of 123.9m 2007: 106.5m.
As described in the Financial Review on page 25, the Group was successful during 2008 in extending and increasing its funding arrangements.
Since the end of 2008 a further 25m of committed facilities has been agreed.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Under the management of the central treasury function, the Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Executive Committee.
Currency risk The Group publishes consolidated accounts in Sterling but conducts much of its global business in other currencies.
As a result it is subject to the risks associated with foreign exchange movements affecting transaction costs transactions, translation of foreign profits profit translation and translation of the underlying net assets of foreign operations asset translation.
Transactions The Groups wide geographic spread both in terms of cost base and customer locations helps to reduce the impact on profitability of movements in exchange rates as well as creating opportunities for central netting of exposures.
It is the Groups policy to minimise risk to exchange rate movements affecting sales and purchases by economically hedging or netting currency exposures at the time of commitment or when there is a high probability of future commitment using currency instruments primarily forward exchange contracts.
A proportion of forecast exposures are hedged depending on the level of confidence and hedging is topped up following regular reviews.
On this basis up to 50% of the Groups annual exposures are likely to be hedged at any point in time.
The Groups net transactional exposure varies from time to time, but at the end of 2008 its forecast exposure for 2009, net of existing hedging derivative instruments, was broadly neutral to continental European currencies, a net payer of Mexican Pesos and Chinese Yuan, but a net recipient of other non Sterling currencies including the US Dollar.
Profit translation The Group is exposed to the translation of profits denominated in foreign currencies into the Sterling based income statement.
The interest cost related to the currency liabilities hedging the asset base provides a partial hedge to this exposure.
Short term currency option contracts may be used to provide limited protection against Sterling strength on an opportunistic basis.
The translation of US Dollar and Euro based profits remain the primary risk to the Group.
Asset translation The Group hedges its net investments in its major overseas operations by way of external currency loans and currency forward contracts.
The intention is to manage the Group's exposure to gains and losses in Group equity resulting from retranslation of currency net assets at balance sheet dates.
To the extent that an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation is determined to be an effective hedge, the gain or loss arising is recognised directly in reserves.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Detail of the quantum of this exposure is provided in note 19.1.
IMI plc Annual Report 2008 89 64165 p61-p120 23 3 09 18:43 Page 90 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 19.
Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk As a result of the Groups asset translation policy, it is exposed to a number of global interest rates the most important of which are US, Eurozone and UK rates.
The analysis of this exposure is shown in note 19.2 of these financial statements.
The Group adopts a policy of maintaining a portion of its liabilities at fixed interest rate and reviewing the balance of the floating rate exposure to ensure that if interest rates rise globally the effect on the Groups income statement is manageable.
The Group has raised US Dollar debt through the issuance of medium to long term fixed rate Loan Notes.
In order to manage its exposure to interest rates, US$45m of this fixed rate exposure was hedged back to floating through the use of interest rate swaps in 1999 covering loan notes with maturities between 2009 and 2014.
The interest component of the fair value of this portion of the Loan Notes has been designated as a hedged item and has been revalued accordingly in the accounts.
The fair value of these interest rate swaps is included in the balance sheet at 5.9m 2007: 3.5m.
The hedged item is included in the value of the debt as an increase in liability of 6.0m 2007: increase 3.6m.
Exposure to other interest rate volatility is managed through a combination of fixed rate debt and derivative instruments where appropriate.
Commodity risk The Groups operating companies purchase metal and metal components with an annual base metal material value of approximately 30m 2007: 40m.
It manages this exposure through a centralised process hedging copper, zinc, aluminium and nickel designed to protect short term margins.
The exposure is managed using a combination of financial contracts and local supply agreements in order to minimise the short term impact of metal price volatility.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the future development of the business.
The Board monitors the demographic spread of its shareholders and employees are encouraged to hold shares in the Company.
The Board also monitors economic profit created and seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages of security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Board considers that a ratio of Debt:EBITDA of 2:1 represents a suitable leverage target and expects to reach this level over the next few years.
A total of 15m was spent on the share buy back programme in 2008 2007: 93m.
The primary financial covenants in the Groups banking arrangements relate to Net Debt to EBITDA and Net Interest to EBITDA ratios.
The Group comfortably complied with these covenants during 2008.

The Group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
For short term cash and cash equivalents and floating rate borrowings, the fair values are the same as carrying value.
For fixed rate borrowings, forward currency contracts, interest rate instruments and commodity contracts fair values have been calculated by discounting the cash flows at prevailing appropriate market rates.
Other assets reflect management's estimate of value on an appropriate basis.
Investments are carried at their fair value which is usually open market value.

19.7 Market risk sensitivity analysis The Group has estimated the impact of the change to the fair values of its financial instruments and the translation of currency profits and assets, on the income statement and on equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% 100 basis points in market interest rates, a 10% strengthening or weakening in Sterling against all other currencies or a 10% increase or decrease in the cost of base metals from the rates applicable at 31 December 2008.
All other variables are assumed to remain constant.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations and taxation.
The analysis is for illustrative purposes only as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
The sensitivity analysis includes the following assumptions: Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income and expense of variable interest financial instruments: Changes in market interest rates only affect the interest income and expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest if these are recognised at their fair value: Changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments and all interest rate hedges are expected to be highly effective: Changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets are estimated by discounting future cash flows at appropriate market rates prevailing at year end: and All net investment hedges are expected to be highly effective.
The outputs from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that the specified changes occur net of any hedging in place at the year end.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to commercial actions taken to mitigate any potential losses from such rate movements, to the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring and to further developments in global financial markets.
As such this table should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses.

The mortality assumptions used for the Fund reflect its experience, together with an allowance for improvements over time.
The experience was reviewed as part of the formal triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 31 March 2008, and the assumptions used as at 31 December 2008 reflect the results of this review.
The table below shows the implied life expectancy from age 65 for the Fund's current and future pensioners based on the assumptions adopted.
The allowance for future improvements in mortality rates from 2008 is in line with the published medium cohort rates, with a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1% 2007: medium cohort rates only.
The sensitivity of the balance sheet liability in respect of the IMI Pension Fund to changes in the key assumptions is shown in note 20 j.

As set out in 20 a above the IMI Pension Fund constitutes around 80% of the total liabilities and 87% of the total assets for the Group's long-term employee benefit arrangements as at 31 December 2008.
It is therefore appropriate to consider the sensitivities to changes in key assumptions in respect of the Fund and these are illustrated below.

Full actuarial valuations of the Fund are carried out triennially, and the figures in this note are based on the calculations carried out in connection with the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2008, and adjusted to the IAS19 basis at 31 December 2008.
This was the first valuation undertaken in accordance with the scheme specific funding provisions of the Pensions Act 2004.
Under this legislation, the Fund's Trustee is required to agree with the Company a suitable, prudent, ongoing funding basis for the Fund.
As at 31 December 2008 this basis was more prudent than the IAS19 standard basis.
In addition, where a deficit exists, there is a requirement to agree an appropriate recovery plan for removing it.
The statement of funding principles agreed with the Trustee resulted in a deficit of 118m being disclosed.
A special contribution of 16.8m was made in December 2008.
Further payments of 16.8m have been agreed for July 2009, July 2010 and July 2011 as part of the recovery plan to close the deficit by 2016.
The level of additional contributions will be subject to review during the next actuarial valuation.
Share-based payments The Group operates the following share-based payment schemes: SAYE savings-related share option scheme This scheme is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20% below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in the business.
SAYE options are exercisable within 6 months of the exercise date and otherwise expire.
Executive Share Option Scheme Executive share options were last awarded to executive directors in 2004 and to certain other employees in 2005 under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme which expired in May 2005.
All outstanding options granted under this scheme were granted subject to stretching tiered performance conditions related to growth in earnings per share above inflation over a fixed period of three financial years.
Executive share options expire if not exercised or lapsed within the periods shown below.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP awards were made in 2005 as part of the transition to new long term incentive arrangements introduced in 2005.
The LTIP allows cash awards to executive directors and selected senior managers within the Group subject to certain performance conditions.
At the end of the performance period, the net of tax value of any LTIP payments can or in the case of executive directors, must normally be invested in market purchases of the Company's ordinary shares pursuant to a deferred share plan.
Such share purchases are to be made through an employee trust and held for a further three year period.
After that period, matching shares are awarded of one additional share for every four with no further performance conditions.
Performance Share Plan PSP These are open to the executive directors and selected senior managers within the Group.
50% of these PSP shares vest subject to EPS growth, based on internal financial performance conditions.
Hence, for purposes of IFRS2, the fair value of the shares does not include any performance related discount.
The plan uses TSR total shareholder return as a performance condition for the other 50% of shares granted.
As TSR is a market based performance condition, the accounting treatment differs from that for shares subject to internal performance conditions.
This means that the TSR performance condition must be incorporated into the calculation of the fair value, that is, there is a TSR-related discount in calculating the fair value.
Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Under the DBP, for executive directors and selected senior managers a proportion of earned annual bonus will be mandatorily deferred for three years and delivered in shares in the Company.
Qualifying employees may also elect to voluntarily defer all or part of the remainder of their annual bonus.
Additional shares, in the form of a matching award, may be earned to a maximum of 100% or 125% for the Chief Executive of the deferred bonus at the entry share price level if stretching performance conditions are met by the Company over the three year deferral period.
Changes to the PSP and DBP have been proposed for 2009.
Details of these proposed changes are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 60.

102 IMI plc Annual Report 2008 64165 p61-p120 Q6:Layout 1 24 3 09 16:20 Page 103 The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The assumptions used for grants in 2008 included a dividend yield of 5.1% 2007: 3.7%, expected share price volatility of 30% 2007: 34%, a weighted average expected life of 3.7 years 2007: 4.4 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.5% 2007: 5.7%.
The expected volatility is wholly based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The total expenses recognised for the year arising from share-based payments are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Equity settled share-based payment expense in employee cost in the income statement including 2.0m 2007: 1.4m in respect of directors 3.9 3.1 22.

An investigation has also been completed into possible incidental breaches of US trade law by CCI.
Legal costs of 4.8m were incurred during the year and an additional provision of 21.5m has been made for the expected fines and certain related legal costs, bringing the total expense for the year for these matters to 26.3m.
Whilst we believe the estimate of these fines and costs to be reliable, the final determination of the fines will be subject to the agreement of the relevant authorities.
It is anticipated that the provided fines and costs will be paid within one year.
The restructuring provision is expected to be fully utilised within one year.
The provision balance reflects residual amounts committed but not spent in relation to a number of specific projects to relocate or reorganise operations and facilities and upgrade talent.
Trade warranties are given in the normal course of business and cover a range of periods, typically of 1-6 years.
Other provisions are mainly environmental provisions, recognising the Group's obligation to remediate contaminated land at a number of current and former sites.
Because of the long term nature of the liability, the timescales are uncertain and the provision represents management's best estimates of these costs.

Commitments Group contracts in respect of future capital expenditure which had been placed at the balance sheet date amounted to 9.2m 2007: 9.2m.
Contingencies Following completion of the European Commission investigations into allegations of anti-competitive behaviour in the EU among certain manufacturers of copper tube and copper fittings, the Company has paid fines of 31.3m in February 2005 and 32.8m in January 2007.
Both of these fines are the subject of ongoing appeals.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors have not anticipated the outcome of either appeal due to the inherent uncertainty of such processes.
The copper tube appeal was heard in 2008 and a judgement is expected in the first half of 2009, the copper fittings appeal has yet to be heard.
We expect to reach final agreement in the near future on a settlement with the US Department of Justice in respect of certain irregular payments by our US subsidiary Control Components Inc CCI that violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
At 31 December 2008 there is a provision for these expected fines and certain related legal costs of 21.5m.
The Korean authorities have recently announced an investigation into the improper payments made to Korean entities.
Subject to the foregoing paragraph, at this date, it is not possible to assess the level of any fines, defence or other costs arising from these or any other actions which may be taken in connection with the Severe Service investigation or the timing of any such actions and accordingly no provision has been made for them in these financial statements.
Group contingent liabilities relating to guarantees in the normal course of business and other items amounted to 80m 2007: 56m.
Related party transactions Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
Certain short term quasi loan arrangements arose from time to time during the year in connection with transactions involving Martin Lamb, the aggregate amount of which did not at any time exceed 1,250, being less than the relevant statutory limits for small transactions of this nature as provided in Section 332 1 of the Companies Act 1985 and, from 1 October 2007, Section 207 1 of the Companies Act 2006.
Detailed information concerning directors emoluments, shareholding, options and retirement benefits are shown in the Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 60.
Directors are considered to be the key management personnel.
Post balance sheet events On 1 January 2009 the 19.1% minority interest in Display Technologies LLC, part of the Merchandising group, was acquired by the Group under the terms of the original purchase agreement.
Based on the contracted pricing mechanism the cash consideration is expected to be around 20m.
