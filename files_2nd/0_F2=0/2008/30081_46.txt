These comprise mainly stamp duty and commission.
v Substantial share interests The Group held interests in 3% or more of any class of capital in seven investee companies.
None of these investments is considered significant in the context of these financial statements.
See note 22 on page 81 for further details of subsidiary investments.
11 Financial Instruments Risk management policies and procedures The Group invests in equities and other investments for the long term in pursuit of the Investment Objectives set out for each share class on pages 2-4.
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction or an increase in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
The principal risks the Group faces in its portfolio management activities are: Market risk comprising price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk Liquidity risk Credit risk The Investment Managers policies and processes for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
11.1 Market Price Risk By the very nature of its activities, the Groups investments are exposed to market price fluctuations.
Management of the risk The Manager runs diversified portfolios for each share class and reports to the Board on the portfolio activity and performance at each board meeting.
The Board monitors the investment activity and strategy to ensure it is compatible with the stated objectives for each share class.
70 TR Property Investment Trust THE GROUP COMPANY Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11.1 Market Price Risk continued The Groups exposure to changes in market prices on its quoted equity investments and investment property portfolio, was as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Investments held at fair value 697,750 1,082,398 Concentration of exposure to price risks As set out in the Investment Policies for each share class on pages 2 to 4, there are limitations on the amount of exposure to a single company, geographical regions or direct property.
These limitations ensure an appropriate spread of exposure to individual or sector price risks.
As an investment company dedicated to investment in the property sector, the Group is exposed to price movements across the property asset class as a whole.
Price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the value of shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair values of the Groups equity and direct property investments.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions and historic trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups equities and direct property exposure at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

11.2 Currency Risk A proportion of the Groups portfolio is invested in overseas securities and their Sterling value can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
Management of the risk The Board receives a report at each board meeting on the proportion of the investment portfolio held in Sterling, Euros or other currencies.
The Group sometimes hedges foreign currency movements outside the Eurozone by funding investments in overseas securities with unsecured loans denominated in the same currency.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into Sterling upon receipt.
Cash deposits are held in Sterling and or Euro denominated accounts.

It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: Sterling Euro - 15% 2007: 15% Sterling Swedish Krone - 15% 2007: 15% These percentages have been determined by taking the highest rate of change seen in each of the last five financial years.

TR Property Investment Trust 73 THE GROUP COMPANY Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11.3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of any investments in fixed interest securities the fair value of the debenture loans the level of income receivable from cash at bank and on deposit the level of interest expense on any variable rate bank loans the prices of the underlying securities held in the portfolios Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
Property companies usually have borrowings themselves and the level of gearing and structure of its debt portfolio is a key factor when assessing the investment in a property company.
The Group has fixed and variable rate borrowings.
The interest rates on the debenture loans are fixed, details are set out in note 14.
In addition to the debentures the Group has an unsecured, multi-currency revolving loan facility which carries a variable rate of interest based on the currency drawn, plus a margin.
The Manager considers both the level of debt on the balance sheet of the Group i. e. the debentures and any bank loans drawn and the see-through gearing, taking into account the assets and liabilities of the underlying investments, when considering the investment portfolio.
These gearing levels are reported regularly to the Board.
The Group did not hold any fixed interest securities throughout the year.
At the year end the Group was holding significant cash balances: part of these cash balances were held to offset the long term borrowings it has in place.
Interest rate risk exposure The exposure at 31 March of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set fixed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due to be repaid.
The Groups exposure to floating interest rates on assets is 51,881,000 2007: 535,000.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on liabilities is 39,994,000 2007: 39,978,000.
Interest receivable, and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2007: same Interest paid on borrowings under the multi-currency loan facility is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent for the type of loan The finance charge on the debenture stocks is at a weighted average interest rate of 9.625% 2007: same.
The year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between floating and fixed interest rate changes.
The minimum and maximum amounts subject to interest rate exposures are shown below.

This level of change is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes throughout the period.
This assessment does not take into account the impact of interest rate changes on the market value of the investments the Group holds.
11.4 Liquidity risk Unquoted investments in the portfolio are subject to liquidity risk.
The Group did not hold any unquoted investments throughout the financial year.
In certain market conditions, the liquidity of direct property investments may be reduced.
Management of the risk The Manager sets limits for the maximum exposure of the portfolio to unquoted and direct property investments.
These are set out in the Investment Policies on pages 2 to 4.
All unquoted investments and direct property investments with a value over 1 million must be approved by the Board for purchase.
11.5 Credit risk The failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Group suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is not considered to be significant.
Investment transactions are carried out with a number of brokers, whose credit standing is reviewed periodically by the investment managers, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
Cash at bank is only held with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
