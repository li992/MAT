5. recoverable vat 2008 2007 000s 000s Recoverable in respect of management fees 2,000 The Association of Investment Companies and JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust lodged a joint appeal in 2004 for the payment of management and performance fees fees by investment trusts to be treated as exempt from VAT.
In June 2007 the European Court of Justice ECJ found in favour of the appellants, declaring that investment trusts should be treated as special investment funds and thus exempted from VAT on fees.
A separate decision by the House of Lords on the Cond Nast Case in January 2008 ruled that the imposition of a three year capping by HM Revenue & Customs HMRC, relating to claims submitted prior to January 1997, was invalid.
HMRC has announced that it would not appeal against either decision, enabling the Manager to reclaim a proportion of VAT paid on behalf of the Company to HMRC in respect of periods between April 1990 and December 1996 and further periods since April 2001.
