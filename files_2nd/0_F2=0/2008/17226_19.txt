The closure of these negotiations has resulted in the Group being able to release prior period corporation tax and deferred tax provisions of 124m.
7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding those held by the Company as treasury shares note 24, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has two 2007: three classes of financial instruments that are potentially dilutive: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period and contingently issuable shares under the Groups long term incentive plan.
In the prior year, the other class of potentially dilutive ordinary shares was the convertible preference shares.

There is an amount of delegated authority to the Treasury Committee, but all activities are summarised in half yearly treasury reports which are presented to the Audit Committee.
The Groups principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans and overdrafts, borrowings, finance leases and trade and other creditors.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various financial assets such as trade debtors and cash and short term and long term bank deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, primarily forward currency contracts and cross-currency swaps.
The purpose of these derivative instruments is to manage the currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It remains the Groups policy not to engage in speculative trading of financial instruments.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks, which remain unchanged from the prior year are stated below: i Foreign currency risk The Group incurs currency exposure in respect of overseas trade purchases made in currencies other than Sterling, primarily being Euro and US dollar.
The Group objective is to reduce risk to short term profits from exchange rate fluctuations.
It is Group policy that any transactional currency exposures recognised to have a material impact on short term profits will be hedged through the use of derivative financial instruments.
As at the balance sheet date, the Group had entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposure up to 50% of its forecasted purchases within next six months.
Exposure on debt denominated in a foreign currency is hedged using cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The sensitivity to a reasonably possible change 5% in the US dollar Euro exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities and the Groups equity due to changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts and cross-currency interest swaps has been determined as being immaterial.
ii Liquidity risk The Group policy is to maintain a balance of funding with a range of maturities and a sufficient level of undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
Short term cash balances, together with undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
The Group finances its operations with a combination of bank credit facilities and bonds.
The Treasury Committee monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve on a quarterly basis, which comprises committed and uncommitted borrowing facilities on the basis of expected cash flow.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups primary non-current financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments, which includes interest payments.
Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.
As the amounts included in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, these amounts do not agree to the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet for borrowings.

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks, as well as credit exposures to customers.
The Group maintains deposits with banks and financial institutions with an acceptable credit rating for a period not exceeding six months.
Further, the Group has specified limits that can be deposited with any one bank or financial institution at any point.
The maximum exposure on cash and cash equivalents and deposits is equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 14.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
iv Other risk Cash flow interest rate risk: The Groups long term policy is to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates by maintaining up to 60% of its consolidated total net debt in fixed rate borrowings over a four year horizon.
As at the balance sheet date all of Groups borrowings are at fixed rate, thereby substantially reducing the Groups exposure to adverse movements in interest rate.
Cash and cash equivalents is a significant interest-bearing asset held by the Group.
At year end, a 1% movement in the interest rate would have had a 5m 2007: 2m impact on the Groups finance income.
There are no other significant interest-bearing assets held by the Group.
b Capital management A key objective of the Groups capital management is to maintain compliance with the covenants set out in the revolving credit facility.
The Groups policy is to maintain both a gearing ratio and interest cover, which represents headroom of at least 10% over and above the requirements laid down in the revolving credit facility.
Throughout the year, the Group has comfortably complied with this policy.
There have been no changes in the objectives, policies or processes with regards to capital management during the years ended 3 February 2008 and 4 February 2007. c Fair values All financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost.
The Euro bonds are retranslated at balance sheet date spot rates.
The fair value of the Sterling and Euro Bonds are measured using closing market prices.
These compare to carrying values as follows: 2008 2007 Amortised Fair Amortised Fair cost value cost value m m m m Bonds current 251 250 Bonds non-current 758 693 748 711 Total Sterling and Euro bonds 758 693 999 961 The fair value of other items within current and non-current borrowing equals their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not significant.

These derivative financial instruments are used to minimise risk from potential movements in foreign exchange rates inherent in cash flow of certain liabilities.
The hedged forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates over the next two years.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity note 24 on cross-currency swaps as at 3 February 2008 are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is generally once every year over the course of the next three 2007: four years.
ii Forward contracts The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
The hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars.
The cash flows hedged will occur within one year of the balance sheet date.
At 3 February 2008, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group has committed was 45m 2007: nil.
The fair value of these outstanding forward exchange contracts at the balance sheet date was 0.2m.

The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds: no part of the schemes is wholly unfunded.
The latest full provisional actuarial valuations, which were carried out at 6 April 2007 and 1 April 2007 for the Morrison and Safeway schemes respectively, were updated for IAS 19 purposes for the periods to 3 February 2008, 4 February 2007 and 29 January 2006 by a qualified independent actuary.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Pension Scheme gives the trustees power to set the level of contributions.
In the Safeway Scheme this power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 4 February 2008 is 138m, including a special contribution of 100m.
b Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligation were as follows: i Financial 2008 2007 2006 Rate of increases in salaries 5.00-6.00% 4.45-5.45% 4.25-5.25% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.75% 3.20% 3.00% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.75% 5.00% 4.75% Inflation assumption 3.75% 3.20% 3.00% ii Longevity The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Male 23.5 19.9 19.9 Female 25.8 22.8 22.8 The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Male 22.2 19.9 19.9 Female 24.7 22.8 22.8 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics.
The longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement.
Amongst the UK population there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption.
This means that a 45 year old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65 year old today.
This particular adjustment, described in the mortality tables below, is known as Long Cohort and is in line with the latest advice from the Pension Regulator.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities the actuary selects the appropriate mortality table that reflects the longevity assumption.
The most up to date tables are used in each period.
The current mortality table used is PNX00 YOB LC 2007 and 2006: PA92 C2020.
As disclosed in the Critical accounting assumptions on page 55, the results of the experience study conducted for the Safeway scheme have been used to adjust the longevity assumption for both schemes, no such adjustment was made for the comparative periods.
iii Expected return on assets The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets, were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Long term rate of return on: Equities 7.00% 7.00% 7.00% Corporate bonds 6.00% 5.00% 4.25% Gilts 4.25-4.50% Property related funds 6.00% 6.00% 7.00% Active currency management assets 5.25% 4.50% Cash 5.50% 5.25% 4.50% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.

The allocation of assets between category is governed by the Investment Principles of each scheme and is the responsibility of the trustees of each respective scheme.
The trustees should take due consideration of the Groups views and a representative of the Group attends Trustee Investment Committees.
The fair values of the schemes assets, which may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, are as follows: 2008 2007 2006 m m m Equities 1,040 1,208 1,190 Corporate bonds 237 221 211 Gilts 531 Property and property related funds 104 260 54 Active currency management assets 66 22 Cash 27 19 59 Total fair value of schemes assets 1,939 1,774 1,536 Present value of defined benefit funded obligation 2,007 1,972 1,952 Net pension liability recognised in the balance sheet 68 198 416 Related deferred tax asset note 20 19 59 125 Net deficit 49 139 291 The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets over the year was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 m m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 1,774 1,536 1,217 Expected return on scheme assets 116 102 83 Actuarial losses gains 113 78 165 Employer contributions 193 94 92 Employee contributions 10 11 13 Benefits paid 41 47 34 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 1,939 1,774 1,536 The above pension scheme assets do not include any investments in the Parent Companys own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

In June 2001 the Company established a stakeholder pension scheme, open to all employees, to which the Company makes matching contributions of a maximum of 5% of eligible earnings.
Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows: 2008 2007 2006 m m m Stakeholder pension scheme 3 1 1 Life assurance scheme 1 1 1 Total costs 4 2 2 Property 22 Provisions Restructuring provisions Total m m m At 4 February 2007 50 95 145 Charged to the income statement 17 17 Unused amounts reversed during the period 8 8 Utilised in period 13 8 21 Unwinding of discount 66 At 3 February 2008 29 110 139 a Restructuring The change of the corporate logo and associated freshening of sections of the stores is well under way and progress is discussed in the CEOs Review.
The provision covers the cost of conclusion on the work already started, and other direct expenditure not associated with the ongoing activities of the Group.
The ongoing restructuring programme in the distribution centres is also included in this balance.
This provision is expected to be utilised within the next financial year.
b Property provisions Property provisions comprise onerous leases provision, petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and provisions for dilapidations on leased buildings.
Onerous leases relate to sublet and vacant properties.
Where the rent receivable on the properties is less than the rent payable, a provision based on present value of the net cost is made to cover the expected shortfall.
The lease commitments range from 1 to 65 years.
Market conditions have a significant impact and hence the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision made where necessary.
As noted in the financial review, adjustments have been made to reflect the change in market conditions and the legislative changes in respect of rates charges for empty properties.
Others comprise petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and dilapidations cost.
Provision is made for decommissioning when the petrol filling station tanks have reached the end of their useful life or when they become redundant and is based on the present value of costs to be incurred to decommission the petrol tanks.
Dilapidation costs are incurred to bring a leased building back to the condition it was originally leased.
Provision is made for these costs, which are incurred on termination of the lease.

In line with IFRS 2 Share-based payment, the Group has fair valued all grants of equity instruments issued after 7 November 2002 which were unvested as of 1 January 2005 and all shadow equity instruments which were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The total charge for the period relating to employee share-based payment plans was 9m 2007: 20m, all of which 2007: 3m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
After corporation and deferred tax, the total charge in the income statement was 7m 2007: 15m.
Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2008 77 27 Share-based payments continued a Share option schemes i Executive share option scheme In May 1995, the Group adopted the 1995 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme which was made available to Directors and other senior employees.
The scheme was terminated on 25 May 2005.
The scheme offered options at the market price two weeks prior to the date of the grant which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The maximum exercise value of the ordinary shares subject to options held by an individual must not exceed the greater of four times earnings and 100,000.
The exercise of options under the scheme is subject to performance criteria broadly requiring an increase in Group operating profits of at least 20% between the year prior to the date of the grant and its third or any succeeding anniversary.
Those options which have been granted after 7 November 2002 have been fair valued using the Binomial stochastic option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions were as follows: Grant date 12 Nov 2004 2 Apr 2003 Share price at grant date 2.33 1.81 Fair value of options granted 1.4m 1.9m Exercise price 2.22 1.75 Dividend yield 1.43% 1.49% Annual risk free interest rate 4.61% 4.12% Expected volatility 29.4% 29.4% The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the last six years.
The fair value calculations do not incorporate the effects of non-market vesting conditions, but the charge is adjusted to reflect an estimate of the number of options which vest.

The scheme allows participants to save up to a maximum of 250 each month for a fixed period of three to five years.
Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing after the end of the fixed period of the contract.
The exercise of options under this scheme is not subject to any performance conditions and is equity-settled.

The awards are free share-based awards, with non-market vesting conditions attached, that accrue the value of dividends over the vesting period.
The maximum total market value of shares over which awards may be granted to any employee during any financial year of the Company is 300% of salary.
Awards normally vest three years after the original grant date providing the relevant performance criteria have been met.
Employees have six months from the vesting date to exercise their options after which they lapse.
The fair value at the date of grant, which is being charged to the income statement over the three-year vesting period, has been calculated based on the following assumptions: Grant date 24 Oct 2007 6 Jun 2007 24 May 2007 Share price at grant date 2.88 3.13 3.23 Assumed leavers 5% 5% 5% Performance criteria achieved 90% 90% 90% Exercise price nil nil nil Fair value of options granted 0.4m 0.1m 10.5m 2008 Weighted average exercise price in Options per share thousands Movement in outstanding share awards Outstanding at start of period Granted 4,470 Expired Outstanding at end of period 4,470 Exercisable at end of period 2008 Share awards outstanding at the end of the period Weighted average remaining contractual file 2.4 years 28 Operating lease arrangements a Lessee arrangements The Group has outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2008 2007 Vehicles, Vehicles, plant and plant and Property equipment Property equipment m m m m Within one year 34 10 27 12 More than one year and less than five years 127 26 110 15 After five years 427 448 3 588 36 585 30 The Group leases various offices, stores and warehouses under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.

30 Contingent liabilities In September 2007 the Office of Fair Trading issued a Statement of Objections to a number of grocery retailers and milk producers, alleging collusion in the setting of prices for certain dairy products in 2002 and 2003.
Morrisons was accused in relation to one infringement in 2002, and has vigorously denied this.
Based on the evidence put forward, the Board does not consider it probable that the Group will ultimately incur a fine, and accordingly have made no provision for any such liability.
31 Post-balance sheet events The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ending 3 February 2008 of 4.125p per share which will absorb an estimated 111m of Shareholders funds.
Subject to approval at the AGM, it will be paid on 6 June 2008 to Shareholders who are on the register of members on 2 May 2008.
As described in the Chief Executive strategy review, the Group intends to return 500m to shareholders through a share buyback programme in the financial year ended February 2009.
