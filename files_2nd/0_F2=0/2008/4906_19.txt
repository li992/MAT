Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 49 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2008 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies General information Domino Printing Sciences plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on page 94.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 3 and in the Report of the Directors on pages 25 to 29.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The Company has elected to also prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except in respect of revalued properties as permitted by IFRS 1 and certain financial instruments of the Group, and has been prepared on a basis consistent with the IFRS accounting policies set out below.
In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the Groups financial instruments and management of capital see note 30.
Four interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the current period.
These are IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies: IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2: IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives: and IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment.
The adoption of these interpretations has not led to any changes in the Groups accounting policies.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 1 amended IAS 27 amended Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate IFRS 1 revised First Time Adoption of IFRS IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations IFRS 8 Operating Segments IAS 23 revised Borrowing Costs IAS 27 revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 32 amended IAS 1 amended Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation IAS 39 amended Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items IAS 39 amended Reclassification of Financial Assets: Effective Date and Transition IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners Improvements to IFRSs The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group other than the requirements for additional segment disclosures within IFRS 8 and the amended requirements relating to business combinations in IFRS 3.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the entities controlled by the Group.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of the Groups subsidiaries.
The cost of acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange plus costs directly attributable to the transaction.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially measured at the fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets is recorded as goodwill.
Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 Financial Statements 50 Notes to the Accounts continued for the year ended 31 October 2008 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued The Companys investments in its subsidiaries are carried at cost less provision for any impairments.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Subsidiaries accounting policies are amended where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Associates Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not control, generally with a shareholding of 20 per cent to 50 per cent of the voting rights.
The Group has a 23.75 per cent holding in Mectec Coding Benelux B. V. a company incorporated in the Netherlands, which has been accounted for as an associate.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
The results and assets and liabilities of the Groups associate are wholly immaterial to the Groups results and balance sheet and therefore disclosure of the information required by IAS 28 Investments in Associates has not been made.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the costs of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually, with goodwill allocated to relevant cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On the disposal of a subsidiary or cash generating unit, any attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Acquired intangible assets business combinations Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination, and that can be separately and reliably measured at fair value, are separately recognised on acquisition.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement over their expected useful lives.
The periods over which the assets are being amortised are: Technology 512 years Customer relationships 510 years Proprietary rights Proprietary rights are measured at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
Software Software that is not integral to an item of hardware is classified as an intangible asset.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the licence term and three years.
Research and development expenditure IAS 38 Intangible assets, requires development spend to be capitalised when certain criteria are met and written off to the Income Statement over a suitable period.
It is the opinion of the directors that all these criteria are only met once the new product being developed has successfully completed the validation stage of the Groups formal Product Creation Process.
Development expenditure after this point in the process is minimal and therefore both research and development expenditure will continue to be charged to the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 51 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation with the exception of certain properties at the Groups Head Office in Cambridge which are stated at deemed cost following transition to IFRS, being valuation less accumulated depreciation at 1 November 2004.
Depreciation of fixed assets is provided on a straight-line basis so as to write off their cost over their expected useful working lives.
The annual rates applied are: Freehold land nil Buildings 2.5% Motor vehicles owned 20% Motor vehicles leased Lease term Plant and machinery 5%20% Computer equipment 20%33% Fixtures and fittings 15%20% Leasehold improvements Lease term Leased assets Property, plant and equipment leased under finance leases is capitalised and depreciated over its expected useful life.
The finance charges are allocated over the primary period of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
The costs of operating leases are charged to the Income Statement as they accrue.
Equipment leased to customers Equipment leased to customers under operating leases is capitalised and depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful working life.
Costs capitalised comprise materials, direct labour and attributable overheads.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets Financial assets are classified as either available for sale financial assets or loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Available for sale financial assets Unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available for sale financial assets, in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and are stated at fair value.
These assets are included in non-current assets, as management do not intend to dispose of the investments within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
The Group owns 10 per cent of the equity capital of Domino Inkjet A S, a company incorporated in Denmark, 19.35 per cent of Graph-Tech AG, a company incorporated in Switzerland, and 3.5 per cent of epc Solutions Inc. a company incorporated in the USA.
In assessing the fair value of each investment, the directors have considered factors such as the recent performance of the company but also the relatively small percentage shareholding, the shareholder structure and the unquoted status of each of the companies shares and concluded that it is appropriate to continue to record the investments at their original cost at 31 October 2008, with the exception of the investment in epc Solutions Inc. which has been fully impaired.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 Financial Statements 52 Notes to the Accounts continued for the year ended 31 October 2008 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, balances on bank accounts, cash in transit and cash floats held in the business.
Bank overdrafts and interest bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received, net of issue costs.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the Income Statement when payable.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after initial recognition, the estimated future cash flows of the investments have been impacted.
Objective evidence of impairment could include significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty: or default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: or it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
The carrying amounts of financial assets are reduced by the amount of the impairment loss directly, except for trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities include borrowings and trade and other payables and are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses forward contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
The fair value of the Groups forward contracts is shown as a financial asset and or liability at the balance sheet date.
The Groups use of forward contracts qualifies for hedge accounting under IAS 39 and accordingly the movement in fair value between the two balance sheet dates is taken directly to equity.
In the Companys books, these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 and accordingly the movement in fair value between the two balance sheet dates is taken through the Companys Income Statement.
In the event of an ineffective hedge, the gain or loss of the ineffective portion would be recognised in profit or loss.
Inventories Inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cost represents materials, direct labour and overheads attributable to the stage of production.
Cost is calculated using a weighted average method.
Contingent consideration Contingent consideration is payable to the former shareholders of current Group subsidiaries at amounts based on the future performance of those subsidiaries as agreed at the time of acquisition.
These liabilities have been measured at their fair value based on management estimates of the expected consideration payable and after discounting the amounts payable to their present value.
Investment in own shares The cost of the Companys shares held by various trusts to satisfy equity-settled compensation schemes is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders in the Company and Group balance sheets.
Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 53 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Revenue Revenue comprises sales to customers after discounts and excludes sales taxes.
Sales of products are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the sales price agreed and the receipt of payment is reasonably certain.
Sales of services are recognised when the service has been performed and the receipt of payment is reasonably certain.
Revenue on longer term service contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the service, generally on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract.
Operating lease income is accounted for on a straight-line basis with any rental increases recognised during the period to which they relate.
Segment reporting The Groups primary reporting segment, as defined by IAS 14 Segment reporting, is geographic by location of subsidiary, which reflects how the Group manages its operations worldwide.
The Groups secondary reporting segment is business segment.
The Group operates in one business segment: the development, manufacture and sale of industrial printing equipment and related products.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
There are both non-market and market based performance conditions attached to the vesting and exercising of equity instruments.
Where plans have market based performance criteria, fair value is measured by the use of a Monte Carlo model, and by Black-Scholes models in all other cases.
The expected life used in the models is based on managements best estimate of behavioural consideration based on historic exercise patterns.
No changes to the fair value are made when the expected or actual level of awards vesting differs from the original estimate due to the non-attainment of market based conditions.
Charges made to the Income Statement in respect of share-based payments are credited back to Retained Earnings.
Foreign currency translation The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the year.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The trading results and cash flows from operations of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences arising in the consolidated accounts on the retranslation at the closing rate of the Groups opening net investments in foreign subsidiaries, together with any differences arising between the average rate and the closing rate in the Income Statement, are shown within a separate reserve in equity the Exchange Reserve.
Domino Printing Sciences plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 Financial Statements 54 Notes to the Accounts continued for the year ended 31 October 2008 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued Under IFRS, goodwill and intangible assets arising on acquisition of overseas subsidiaries must be considered to be denominated in the functional currency of the acquired company.
As such, foreign exchange differences arise due to the movement in exchange rates between balance sheet dates.
The differences arising are shown within the Exchange Reserve.
Pension scheme arrangements The Group operates a money purchase pension scheme for its UK employees and has similar schemes in other countries.
The pension cost charge represents contributions payable in respect of the period.
Taxation Current taxation is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the tax rates and laws in the relevant territory that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
The tax charged for the period reflects the expected tax payable for the period along with adjustments for tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the period when the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Groups deferred tax provision is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Dividends Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders, in the case of the final dividend, or by the Board of Directors, in the case of the interim dividend.
Dividends are shown as a component of the movement in shareholders equity.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
a Critical accounting judgements The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations which are dealt with separately below, that the directors have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Intangible assets acquired through the purchase of subsidiary undertakings In accordance with IFRS 3 Business combinations, the Group is required to recognise, on the acquisition of a subsidiary, internally generated intangible assets which the acquired company may hold but are not reflected in the balance sheet of the subsidiary.
Examples of such assets would be trademarks, customer lists and network, intellectual property rights and technology portfolios.
These assets are recognised separately from acquired goodwill.
Valuing such assets is dependent on numerous factors, including company forecasts and market benchmark data.
Because of the complexity and subjectivity of this work, the Group engages independent, third party valuation experts to advise on the value of such assets to be recognised on acquisition and the period over which the assets should be charged to the Income Statement.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty continued b Key sources of estimation and uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation and uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value.
The carrying value of goodwill at 31 October 2008 was 71,817,000.
Goodwill is initially measured as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Contingent consideration The Group initially estimates the amounts payable under earn-out plans to the former shareholders of acquired companies based on the business model produced at the time of acquisition.
Earn-out clauses within acquisition agreements typically contain provisions for amounts payable to the former shareholders based on future financial performance.
In order to calculate the expected future payments, the acquisition business model contains estimates of the future financial performance for the acquired business.
The post-acquisition performance and expected future performance of acquired companies is reviewed throughout the year.
Any adjustments required to contingent consideration arising from a significant departure of financial performance from the original acquisition plan are made as required.
Provisions The Group assesses the carrying value of both debtor and inventory balances based on past losses, current trading patterns and anticipated future events.
Provisions for expected future cash outflows are made based upon past experience and managements assessment of likely outflow, after taking the appropriate professional advice when necessary.
Segmental information The Group manages its business on a geographical basis, based in three main regions: Europe, the Americas and Asia.

Goodwill continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated upon acquisition to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Single CGUs Domino Coding Limited PR 480 480 Domino Printing Solutions Inc. 1,498 1,498 Domino Printech India Private Limited 332 332 Pri-Ma-Tech Verwaltungs GmbH 645 573 Citronix LP 9,915 7,596 Domino Deutschland GmbH Commercial Printing business 455 455 Belgian coding and marking business 1,292 Comprising several CGUs Laser product range 14,158 11,457 Outer Case Coding product range 3,249 3,249 Wiedenbach product range 6,112 6,112 Purex product range 4,994 3,708 Integrated Solutions 1,458 5,601 Print and Apply product range 5,056 5,112 Thermal Transfer Overprinting product range 5,561 5,995 Thermal Ink Jet product range 16,612 71,817 52,168 The Group tests annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts within the CGUs.
Likewise, changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on recent history and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and, where applicable, relevant acquisition business plans.
Cash flow projections for the next five years are prepared based on these sources and estimated growth rates.
Cash flows beyond five years are then calculated into perpetuity using a growth rate equal to long term inflation, on the basis that these businesses are held for the long term benefit of the Group.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for each CGU is 10 per cent.
At 31 October 2008, before impairment testing, goodwill of 5,601,000 was allocated to the Integrated Solutions CGU.
The value to Domino of the business of Control Information Technology GmbH, the supplier of Track and Trace and line control software to the pharmaceutical and other industries, has been reviewed in light of changes in the economic environment.
Legislation covering item level serialisation and authentication of pharmaceutical products expected to take full effect in 2009 has now been delayed, in some key territories by up to six years.
Therefore, the Group has revised its cash flow forecasts for this CGU.
As a result, goodwill allocated to the Integrated Solutions CGU has been reduced to its recoverable amount through the release of 2,245,000 contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of Control and recognition of an impairment loss against goodwill of 1,831,000.

The carrying amounts of the Groups monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in these currencies at the reporting date are as follows: Group Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 Assets Euro 22,992 18,325 1,745 2,074 US dollar 18,011 9,962 1,426 924 RMB 8,922 7,913 49,925 36,200 3,171 2,998 Liabilities Euro 27,600 10,740 US dollar 10,569 7,625 RMB 5,519 4,624 43,688 22,989 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10 per cent increase and decrease in sterling against the relevant foreign currencies.
Ten per cent represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a 10 per cent change in foreign currency rates on: i Foreign currency monetary assets and monetary liabilities outstanding at the balance sheet date.
ii The value to the Group of its investments in foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro, the US dollar or the Chinese renminbi.
Financial Instruments continued The movement in profit for the year is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to exchange movements in US dollar, euro and renminbi denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
The movement in equity is mainly as a result of the Groups exposure to its investments in subsidiaries in Europe, the USA and China, in addition to US dollar and euro denominated long term intercompany loans made by the parent company.
In managements opinion, the sensitivity analysis above is not fully representative of the inherent foreign exchange risk to which the Group is exposed as it does not take account of the impact on the income statement of translation of the annual profits and losses made by overseas subsidiaries.
Forward foreign exchange contracts It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover anticipated receipts and purchases in selected foreign currencies within 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the net exposure generated.
Contracts denominated in euros and US dollars are placed on a rolling 12 month basis.
Smaller contracts are also placed, typically over no more than three months, in a variety of other currencies in which the Group trades.
All of the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as effective cash flow hedges under IAS 39 for the purposes of hedge accounting.
The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flows associated with forward foreign exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges are expected to occur: Carrying Expected Less than 3 36 612 amount cashflows months months months Group and Company 000 000 000 000 000 2008 Forward foreign exchange contracts 1,637 18,637 5,260 5,553 7,824 2007 Forward foreign exchange contracts 26 18,378 4,374 4,607 9,397 Interest rate risk management and sensitivity The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow and deposit funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate cash deposits and borrowings.
The sensitivity analysis below assumes that for floating rate cash deposits and liabilities, the quantum as at the balance sheet date was in place for the whole year.
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 October 2008 would increase decrease by 110,000.
The Companys profit for the year ended 31 October 2008 would increase decrease by 56,000. Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a cautious approach to credit risk management, only entering into transactions with counterparties with recognised credit ratings: either through independent third party appraisal or through the Groups own trading records and other publicly available financial information.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits.
Disclosures related to the credit risk associated with trade receivables are presented in note 20.

Financial Instruments continued Liquidity risk management The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The following tables detail the Groups and the Companys remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
The contractual maturity of derivative financial instruments is considered in note 27.

Fair value of financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows: i The fair value of a non-derivative financial asset and financial liability is the carrying amount, as this approximates their fair value.
ii The fair value of a derivative is estimated by calculating the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price at the balance sheet date for the residual maturity of the contract.
The carrying amounts of all financial assets and liabilities in the financial statements approximate their fair values.
