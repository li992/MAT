preparation Group and Company The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the EU, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have also been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to include the fair value of certain financial instruments in accordance with IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent company, ICAP plc.
The Group maintains a columnar format for the presentation of its consolidated income statement.
This enables the Group to continue its practice of improving the understanding of its results by presenting profit for the year before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
This is the profit measure used to calculate adjusted EPS and is considered to be the most appropriate as it better reflects the Groups underlying cash earnings.
Profit before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items is reconciled to profit before tax on the face of the income statement.
Items which are of a non-recurring nature and material, when considering both size and nature, have been disclosed separately to give a clearer presentation of the Groups results.
These items are shown as exceptional items on the face of the income statement.
The Group has reanalysed its prior year exceptional items to show income and expense items separately where they are unrelated.
There is no overall effect on the results or net assets of the Group.
The Company has taken advantage of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its own income statement.
Group Intangible assets arising on consolidation represent goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets on business combinations since 1 April 2004.
The amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets and any impairment of goodwill is included in the income statement within the column amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation.
b Basis of consolidation Group The Groups consolidated financial statements include the results and net assets of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Groups share of joint ventures and associates.
An entity is regarded as a subsidiary if the Group has control over its strategic, operating and financial policies and intends to hold the investment on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
The results of companies acquired during the year are included in the Groups results from the effective date of acquisition.
The results of companies disposed of during the year are included up to the effective date of disposal.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, exercises joint control over its operating and financial policies.
An interest exists where an investment is held on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
Joint ventures are proportionately consolidated, whereby the Groups income statement and balance sheet include the Groups share of the income and assets on a line-by-line basis.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, can exercise significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
Significant influence generally exists where the Group holds more than 20% and less than 50% of the shareholders voting rights.
Associates are accounted for under the equity method whereby the Groups income statement includes its share of their profits and losses and the Groups balance sheet includes its share of their net assets.
c Segmental analysis Primary segment geographic The Group regards its primary reporting segment as geographic as this is substantially the basis on which it manages its operations.
The three geographic business segments are Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific.
Secondary segment business The Groups secondary segmentation is by business type voice, electronic and information divisions.
The voice division represents trades concluded directly by the Groups staff for interest rates, credit, FX, commodities and emerging market products.
The electronic division represents trades concluded via electronic trading platforms and post-trade services.
The information division represents the sale of market data and research services.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 62 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Basis of preparation continued d Recent accounting developments IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the complementary amendment to IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures have been adopted with effect from 1 April 2007.
IFRS7 introduces new disclosure requirements for financial instruments, but has not affected the valuation or classification of the Groups financial instruments.
The comparative disclosures have been restated to comply with the requirements of IFRS7.
IFRIC11 IFRS2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions which clarified the application of IFRS2 Share-Based Payment to certain share-based transactions has been adopted with effect from 1 April 2007.
There has been no impact on the consolidated results or net assets of the Group as a result of this adoption.
As at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective.
The Group has not applied these Standards and Interpretations in the preparation of these financial statements: IFRS8 Operating Segments applies to accounting periods beginning after 1 January 2009.
This standard replaces IAS14 Segment Reporting and will not affect the results of the Group but will require a change in the disclosure of segmental information.
IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes applies to accounting periods beginning after 1 July 2008 and is not expected to have any impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC14 IAS19 Minimum Funding Requirements applies to accounting periods beginning after 1 January 2008 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
Amendments to IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements, IAS23 Borrowing Costs, IAS32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IFRS3 Business Combinations, IFRS2 Share-Based Payment, and IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements all apply to accounting periods beginning after 1 January 2009 and have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The impact on the Groups financial statements of the future adoption of the Standards and Interpretations is still under review, but the Group does not expect any of these changes to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the Group.
2 Principal accounting policies Group a Revenue Revenue comprises commission from the Groups agency businesses, brokerage from matched principal transactions and fees received from the sale of financial information to third parties.
Matched principal business Certain Group companies are involved as principal in the purchase and simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
Revenue is generated from the difference between the purchase and sale proceeds and is recognised in full at the time of the simultaneous commitment by the counterparties to sell and purchase the financial instrument.
Agency business The Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers of financial instruments and raises invoices monthly for the service provided.
The Group does not act as principal and only receives and transmits orders between counterparties.
Revenue is stated net of rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes and is recognised in full on the date of the trade.
Amounts receivable at the year end are reported as other trade debtors within trade and other receivables note 18.
The Group also acts as a broker of exchange listed products, where the Group executes client orders as principal and then novates the trade to the underlying clients respective clearing broker for settlement.
Brokerage is collected by either price difference between purchase and sale proceeds or invoice, depending on the product, market and agreements in place with the clients.
For the shipbroking business, the Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers of services and recognises revenue when the Group has a contractual entitlement to commission, normally the point at which there is a completion of contractual terms between the principals of a transaction.
Information services The Group receives fees from the sale of financial information to third parties.
This is stated net of value added tax and other sales taxes and is recognised in revenue on an accruals basis to match the provision of the service.
63 ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 ICAP in ten Business review Governance Financial statements 2 Principal accounting policies continued b Government grants Revenue grants received are credited to the income statement on an accruals basis over the period the related expenditure is charged and are shown separately within other income.
c Intangible assets arising on consolidation Intangible assets arising on consolidation include all goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets identified at the time of acquisition of an entity.
Amortisation or impairment of these assets is disclosed on the face of the income statement.
i Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and represents the cost of the acquisition in excess of the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Fair values are determined based on an assessment of the value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired, including reference to market prices and by discounting expected future cash flows to present value.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill was written off directly to reserves.
The transitional arrangements of IFRS3 Business Combinations allow this goodwill to remain eliminated.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 1998, goodwill was capitalised and, until 31 March 2004, was amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over its useful life.
Since transition to IFRS on 1 April 2004 goodwill is no longer amortised, but is subject to an annual impairment review.
For acquisitions on or after 1 April 2004, any residual goodwill, after separately identifiable intangible assets have been recognised, is capitalised on the balance sheet and is subject to an annual impairment review.
Any impairment of goodwill is recognised in the income statement.
Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements of IFRS3, goodwill previously recognised under UK GAAP has been included in the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet as at 1 April 2004 at net book value as an equivalent to fair value.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures is shown within intangible fixed assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is included within their carrying value.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal, except for goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998, which remains eliminated.
ii Separately identifiable intangible assets For acquisitions since 1 April 2004, the Group has applied the provisions of IFRS3 and has separately identified intangible assets where appropriate.
These generally include customer contracts and customer relationships.
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are initially stated at fair value and subsequently adjusted for amortisation and any impairment.
Impairment charges are recognised in the income statement.
Where an impairment has taken place, the asset is reviewed annually for any reversal of the impairment.
Any reversal of impairments are credited to the income statement.
Amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships 210 years Customer contracts Period of contract Other intangible assets Period of contract d Intangible assets arising from development expenditure Development expenditure on software for electronic trading platforms is recognised as an intangible asset in accordance with the provisions of IAS38 Intangible Assets.
Amortisation of these assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the asset of three to five years.
Amortisation of intangible assets arising from development expenditure is charged within operating expenses in profit before amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
Amortisation is charged against assets from the date at which the asset becomes available for use.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 64 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Principal accounting policies continued e Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is initially recognised at fair value less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment in its value.
It is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life as follows: Short leasehold property Period of lease Furniture, fixtures and equipment 35 years Motor vehicles 34 years The Group reviews its depreciation rates regularly to take account of any changes in circumstances.
These rates are determined on consideration of factors such as the expected rate of technological development and anticipated usage levels.
When a leasehold property becomes surplus to the Groups foreseeable business requirements, provision is made on a discounted basis for the expected future net cost of the property.
f Leased assets Assets financed by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group finance leases are capitalised on the balance sheet at fair value.
Lease repayments comprise both a capital element and a finance element.
The capital element of the leasing commitment is shown as an obligation to the lessor in the balance sheet and the finance element is charged to the income statement on a constant periodic rate of change basis.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
g Financial assets Financial assets are classified as available-for-sale, loans and receivables or financial assets at fair value through the income statement on initial recognition.
Available-for-sale: available-for-sale financial assets are debt and equity non-derivative financial assets and are initially recognised at fair value.
Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
When an investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
For equity financial assets, where the fair value cannot be reliably measured, the assets are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
These assets are generally expected to be held for the long term and are included in non-current assets.
Assets such as shares or seats in exchanges, cash related instruments and long-term equity investments that do not qualify as associates or joint ventures are classified as available-for-sale.
Fair value through the income statement: fair value through the income statement assets are designated as such where they meet the conditions of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and are initially recognised at fair value and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in the income statement.
These assets are usually held for short-term gain, or are financial instruments not designated as hedges.
The accounting policy for fair value hedges is included in note 2 j.
These assets are included in trade and other receivables note 18.
Loans and receivables: loans and receivable are non-derivative financial instruments which have a fixed or easily determinable value.
They are recognised at cost, less any provisions for impairment in their value.
Financial assets not held at fair value are impaired where there is objective evidence that the value may be impaired.
The amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of any expected future cash flows, with any impairment being recognised in the income statement.
h Matched principal business Certain Group companies are involved as principal in the purchase and simultaneous commitment to sell securities and other financial instruments, between third parties.
Such trades are complete only when both sides of the transaction are settled and therefore the Group is exposed to the risk in the event that one side of the transaction remains unsettled.
Substantially all the transactions settle within a short period of time and on a  basis and, as such, the settlement risk is considered to be low.
All amounts due to and payable by counterparties in respect of matched principal business are shown gross as matched principal trade debtors and matched principal trade creditors notes 18 and 19, except where a netting agreement which is legally enforceable at all times exists and the asset and liability are either settled net or simultaneously.
65 ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 ICAP in ten Business review Governance Financial statements 2 Principal accounting policies continued i Matched stock lending business Certain Group companies are involved in collateralised stock lending transactions as an intermediary between counterparties.
Such trades are complete only when both the collateral and stock for each side of the transaction is returned.
The gross amounts of collateral due and receivable are disclosed in the balance sheet as deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned notes 18 and 19. j Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses various financial instruments as hedges to reduce exposure to foreign exchange movements.
These can include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options and cross currency swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value adjusted for transaction costs.
The fair values of financial instrument derivatives are determined by reference to quoted prices in an active market.
Where no such active market exists, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques from observable data, including discounted cash flow analysis and the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of the derivative depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the exposure being hedged.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the terms of the hedge must be clearly documented at inception and there must be an expectation that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk.
Hedge effectiveness is tested throughout the life of the hedge and if at any point it is concluded that the relationship can no longer be expected to remain highly effective in achieving its objective, the hedge relationship is terminated.
Gains and losses on financial instrument derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting are recognised according to the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Hedges are either classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Fair value hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
The hedging instrument and hedged item are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in fair value being taken through the income statement.
Cash flow hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to a particular asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Gains or losses on designated cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity, to the extent that they are determined to be effective.
Any remaining portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
On recognition of the hedged asset or liability, any gains or losses that had previously been recognised directly in equity are included in the initial measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss in equity remains there and is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Net investment hedges: changes in the value of foreign denominated investments due to currency movements are recognised directly in equity.
The accounting treatment for a net investment hedge is generally consistent with the treatment for a cash flow hedge.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement on the ultimate disposal of the foreign denominated investment.
Where financial instrument derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair market value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
k Client money The Group holds money on behalf of clients in accordance with the client money rules of the FSA.
Since the Group is not beneficially entitled to these amounts, they are excluded from the Group balance sheet along with the corresponding liabilities to clients.
The amounts held on behalf of clients at the balance sheet date are included in note 33. l Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are subject to insignificant risk of change in fair value and are readily convertible into a known amount of cash.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 66 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Principal accounting policies continued m Long-term borrowings Long-term borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
At subsequent reporting dates long-term borrowings are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with changes in value recognised through the income statement.
Transaction costs are recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings.
n Pension costs The Group mainly operates defined contribution schemes.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they fall due.
Any difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short-term asset or liability.
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the US that is closed to new entrants.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest arising on the pension schemes liabilities is recognised in the income statement within finance income and finance costs.
The pension scheme deficit recognised in the balance sheet represents the difference between the fair value of the assets of the plan and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense, net of the deferred tax impact.
The expected return on schemes assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long-term yields that will arise from the specific assets held within the pension scheme.
o Employee share-based payments and share ownership trusts The Group awards share options and other share-based payments as part of employee incentive schemes.
The Group has applied IFRS2 Share-Based Payment for all such awards granted since 7 November 2002.
The fair value of services acquired is measured by the fair value of the shares or share options awarded at the time of granting and is charged to staff costs over the period the service is received on a straight-line basis.
A reserve of an equivalent amount is held on the balance sheet as part of the retained earnings.
The fair value of share options awarded is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and takes into account various parameters, including the exercise price, current share price, risk free rate of return and the volatility of ICAPs share price.
The expected lives used in the fair value calculations are adjusted for the estimated effect of non-transferability and exercise restrictions.
Investments in own shares held in connection with the Groups employee share schemes are held in trust and are deducted from shareholders equity.
Purchases, sales and transfers of own shares are disclosed as changes in shareholders equity.
p Tax Tax on the profit for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior years.
Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also included within equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the amounts charged or credited for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rate of tax expected to apply when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group is able to control the timing of dividends from its overseas entities and therefore does not expect to remit overseas earnings in the foreseeable future in a way which would result in a tax charge.
As a consequence deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has been entered into by the subsidiary.
No provision is made in respect of any further tax liability that would arise on the distribution of retained earnings of overseas joint ventures and associates.
67 ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 ICAP in ten Business review Governance Financial statements 2 Principal accounting policies continued q Foreign currencies In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of that entity at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences are recognised in the income statement, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in value are recognised directly in equity.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
On consolidation, the results of overseas businesses are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange rates for the period where these approximate to the rate at the date of transaction.
Assets and liabilities of overseas businesses are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are recognised within equity.
Cumulative translation differences arising after the transition to IFRS are taken to the income statement on disposal of the net investment.
In accordance with IAS29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures that report in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are restated in terms of the measuring unit at the balance sheet date before they are translated into the reporting currency of the Group.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Where applicable the Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising before the date of transition to IFRS as denominated in the presentational currency of the Group.
In the cash flow statement, cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange rate for the year or at the rate prevailing at the time of the transaction where more appropriate.
r Treasury Shares Treasury Shares are recognised in equity and are measured at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Company In addition to the above accounting policies, the following relate specifically to the Company.
Investment in subsidiaries An entity is regarded as a subsidiary if the Company has control over its strategic, operating and financial policies and intends to hold the investment on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
The Company recognises investments in subsidiaries initially at fair value, and subsequent changes in value as a result of impairment are recognised in the income statement.
Dividends The Company recognises dividends payable only when they have been approved by the shareholders of the Company in a general meeting, or the amount due has been paid.
Dividends receivable are recognised when they are received.
Share awards to employees The cost of share awards to employees of subsidiaries are not recharged by the Company.
Functional and presentational currency The Company considers its functional currency to be UK sterling as that is the currency of the economic environment in which it operates.
Accordingly the results of the Company and the Group are also presented in UK sterling.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 68 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Principal accounting policies continued Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates.
Estimates, judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The accounting policies deemed critical to the Groups results and financial position, based upon materiality and significant judgements and estimates, are discussed below.
i Goodwill and intangible assets The Group reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually at the balance sheet date or when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that impairment may have taken place.
Intangible assets remaining useful lives are reviewed annually and they are also reviewed for impairment when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that impairment may have taken place.
The impairment review is performed by projecting future cash flows, excluding finance and tax, based upon budgets and forecasts and making appropriate assumptions about rates of growth.
These are discounted using a rate that takes into account prevailing market interest rates.
If the present value of the projected cash flows is less than the carrying value of the underlying net assets and related goodwill or intangible asset, an impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
This calculation requires the exercise of significant judgement by management: if the estimates made prove to be incorrect or performance does not meet expectations which affect the amount and timing of future cash flows, goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods.
For goodwill, impairment charges are not reversed and impaired intangible assets are reviewed annually for reversal of previous impairment.
ii Trade receivables The Group provides for impairment of trade receivables to estimate existing bad debts and amendments to sales invoices.
The provision is estimated based on historic trends.
An increase or decrease in these trends of 1% would not have a material effect on the net assets of the Group.
iii Share-based payments The Group measures the cost of equity settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.
Determining the value of a grant of equity instruments requires selecting an appropriate valuation model and estimating the required inputs to that model, including the expected life of the option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.
The assumptions and model used are disclosed in note 26. iv Tax Significant judgement is required in determining the Groups income tax liabilities.
In arriving at the current and deferred tax liability the Group has taken account of tax issues that are subject to ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities.
Calculations of these liabilities have been based on managements assessment of legal and professional advice, case law and other relevant guidance.
Where the expected tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax amounts in the period in which such determination is made.

There is no effect on the overall results or net assets of the Group.
The EBS related exceptional item relates to the final reorganisation and rationalisation costs following the acquisition of EBS in June 2006.
A sub-custodian made a post-trade settlement adjustment debiting a Group companys account for a total of 22.5m without notice or the Groups consent.
As a result of the need to resort to litigation to recover the debt, the Group has fully provided against this debt 12.7m after offsetting cost recoveries.
During the year ended 31 March 2007 the Group closed a number of its futures operations.
The gain that arises in the current year is as a result of the disposal of shares and memberships included within available-for-sale assets whose disposal was restricted in the prior year.
This is offset by rationalisation and other costs related to the closure of these businesses.
Other exceptional gains arise from the disposal of exchange shares and seats together with litigation settlements in Australia and Hong Kong.

ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 78 Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Earnings per ordinary share The Group is required only to disclose the basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement.
The Group continues to calculate an adjusted EPS measurement ratio, disclosed below, as it believes that it is the most appropriate measurement since it better reflects the businesss underlying cash earnings.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the parent of 155.7m 2007 121.3m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 635.4m shares 2007 629.9m.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue excludes the weighted average number of shares held as Treasury Shares of 2.2m 2007 0.6m and by trusts relating to employee share schemes on which dividends have been waived, being 11.5m shares 2007 9.9m.
Diluted earnings per share takes into account the dilutive effect of share options outstanding under the Companys employee share schemes.

79 ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 ICAP in ten Business review Governance Financial statements 13 Acquisitions a Subsidiaries current year Traiana Inc and subsidiaries Traiana On 3 December 2007 the Group acquired Traiana, a provider of post-trade services to financial institutions.
Traiana is incorporated in the US, with subsidiary operations in the UK and Israel.
The total consideration of 120.3m $247.4m, including acquisition costs, was funded by cash of 116.4m $239.3m and options over ICAP ordinary 10p shares with a fair value of 3.9m $8.1m.
These options will vest over the next four years.
Fair value adjustments include intangible assets arising on consolidation of 65.9m $135.4m that have been recognised in respect of customer relationships.
This has been valued using the net present value of expected future cash flows and is being amortised over ten years.
The Group considers the fair value of the goodwill of 45.4m is reasonable and relates to the future growth potential of the business that is not separately identifiable.
In the period from acquisition to 31 March 2008, Traiana contributed 2.5m to revenue and a pre-tax loss before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items of 1.0m.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year the estimated contribution to revenue would have been 7.6m, with a pre-tax loss before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items of 0.3m.
ICAP Hyde Holdings Limited formerly Hyde Holdings Limited and related companies Hyde On 1 May 2007 the Group completed the acquisition of Hyde which consisted of 75% of ICAP Hyde & Company Limited formerly J. E. Hyde & Co. Limited, a provider of a wide range of shipbroking and related services, and a 75% controlling interest in the freight derivatives joint venture that was created with ICAP in 2005.
The consideration of 15.4m includes 2.5m of estimated deferred consideration, the final amount of which is dependent upon certain future revenue of Hyde.
The maximum consideration payable is 17.7m.
The fair value adjustments include the recognition of intangible assets arising on consolidation of 6.0m, the majority of which is in respect of customer relationships that are being amortised over six years.
The Group considers that the fair value of 10.0m for the goodwill is reasonable and relates to the future growth potential of the business that is not separately identifiable.
In the period from acquisition to 31 March 2008, Hyde contributed 23.6m to revenue and 5.5m to pre-tax profit before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, the estimated revenue would have been 25.0m with pre-tax profit before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items of 5.9m.
Earnout arrangements exist that give the minority shareholders the option to sell the 25% owned by them to the Group in three equal instalments after three years.
The Group has an option to buy the minority holding after six years.
The fair value of these options is considered to be negligible, as the amounts paid will be at the fair value of the business.
Capital Shipbrokers Limited and related companies Capital In January 2008, the Group acquired Capital through its investment in Hyde.
Capital is incorporated in the UK and is involved in similar business activities to Hyde.
Initial cash consideration was 21.7m with further deferred consideration estimated to be 6.2m in respect of a payment for the net assets and an earnout based on the profit for the three years post acquisition.
Fair value adjustments including intangible assets arising on consolidation of 4.2m, representing customer relationships, have been recognised on acquisition.
These assets will be amortised over five years.
Goodwill of 21.6m was recognised on the acquisition, and the Group considers this to be the fair value of the future growth potential and synergies of Capital which are not separately identifiable.
In the period from acquisition to 31 March 2008, Capital contributed 0.5m to revenue and 0.1m to pre-tax profit before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, the estimated revenue would have been 8.3m with pre-tax profit before amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation and exceptional items of 3.3m.
Other acquisitions The Group has also invested 2.3m in new companies in Argentina, Brazil and Chile and a further 0.2m in Colombia.
An additional 0.1m has been recognised as goodwill on acquisition.
The Group acquired the remaining 49.9% minority of Altex-ATS Limited for a nominal sum.
The goodwill of 1.5m previously recognised on this acquisition has been reversed.

It is anticipated that intangible assets arising on the acquisition of voice broking businesses have a finite life.
The Group reviews the performance of the businesses and reassesses the likely period over which the acquired intangible asset is likely to continue to add value to the business each year.
As a result some businesses will have no impairment in a particular year while others will.

Matched principal transactions are those where the Group acts as principal in the simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
Such trades have no contractual settlement date and are complete only when both sides of the transaction are settled, and therefore an aged analysis of matched principal trade debtors is not appropriate.
Substantially all matched principal debtors settle within a short period of time, usually within three days of trade date.
Deposits paid for securities borrowed represents the cash paid as collateral in a stock lending transaction.
The Group acts as an intermediary between counterparties for collateralised stock lending transactions.
Such trades are only complete when both the collateral and stock for each side of the transaction are returned.
The gross amounts of collateral due and receivable are disclosed on the balance sheet notes 19 and 23.
Other trade debtors represents amounts receivable in respect of the agency business and information services.
As at 31 March the following other trade debtors were past their normal settlement date but had not been impaired.
This provision is based upon historical data for the trade debtors of the Group, and represents the expected reduction in the amount receivable as a result of invoicing errors and other disputes.

93 ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 ICAP in ten Business review Governance Financial statements 23 Financial risk management Group The Group operates internationally and is exposed to a variety of financial risks including liquidity, interest rate, currency, credit and price risk.
The Groups funding and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk are managed by the Groups treasury function in accordance with a policy framework approved by the finance committee.
The framework lays out the Groups appetite for risk and the steps to be taken to manage these risks.
The finance committee receives bimonthly reports on the activities of the treasury function and is also responsible for approving significant transactions such as new financing arrangements or changes to the Groups hedging strategy.
The group risk committee sets and monitors treasurys counterparty limits.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance by using derivative instruments to lower funding costs, alter interest rate exposures arising as a result of mismatches between assets and liabilities or to achieve greater certainty of future costs.
The use of derivatives forms part of the Groups overall risk management framework as determined by the board through the group risk and group finance committees.
a Financial assets and liabilities The carrying value less impairment of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values due to their short-term nature.

ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 96 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial risk management continued b Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties in respect of its agency, matched principal and corporate treasury operations.
The risk in respect of the agency business is limited to the collection of agency commission and is controlled by the establishment and monitoring of credit limits for individual clients.
The exposure to credit loss is limited to the carrying value of the receivable.
Concentration is limited since the customer base is both large and unrelated.
No significant concentrations of risk existed at any time during the year.
The matched principal business involves the Group acting as a counterparty on trades which may involve one or more financial instruments and or counterparties.
The Group manages its credit risk in respect of these transactions by having policies and procedures in place to ensure that the risks inherent in all trades are matched and that appropriate credit limits have been set and are monitored at entity, parent and country level to restrict the exposure to potential loss.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited by the Groups policy of requiring its corporate treasury transactions to be undertaken with financial institutions which have been approved by the group risk committee and which are investment grade rated or better by one or more recognised credit rating agencies.
There were no significant concentrations of risk at the year end.
Trade receivables matched principal trade debtors, deposits paid for securities borrowed and other trade debtors consist of a large number of customers.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.
The Groups counterparty risk did not exceed 15% of the Groups capital at any time.
At least 90% of the Groups counterparty risk is with institutions which have an external credit rating of investment grade or better BBB.
The remaining counterparties are closely monitored and have strict trading limits.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for the Group is represented by the total fair value of the financial assets plus other off-balance sheet items as disclosed below: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2008 2007 m m Financial assets of the Group 38,396.9 84,121.1 Guarantees given to counterparties 73.2 567.3 38,470.1 84,688.4 The Group holds cash deposits from a few counterparties to guarantee their trading lines with the Group.
Collateral pledged and received as a result of the stock lending business is disclosed in trade and other receivables and trade and other payables notes 18 and 19. c Liquidity risk management The Group seeks to ensure that it has constant access, even in periods of market turmoil, to an appropriate level of cash, other forms of marketable securities and committed funding lines to enable it to finance its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost effective and attractive terms.
The Group is currently financed from a mix of bank facilities and subordinated loan notes.
Over time, the Group plans to diversify its sources of finance into the public and private debt markets.
As described in note 21 the Group refinanced its core bank facilities into a new three-year, 520m committed revolving credit facility.
At 31 March 2008 committed headroom under the facility stood at 192.1m 2007 204.6m.
The Groups policy is to maintain minimum committed headroom under its core credit facilities of 75m to enable it to react to unexpected events.
Although the Group does not undertake proprietary trading, it is subject to the margin requirements of the clearing houses or exchanges used to settle certain client trades.
The most significant margin requirements arise in the Groups US business where the average cash requirement placed by the FICC has increased to $88.5m in the first quarter of 2008.
The FICC margin requirements are met from a combination of internal cash resources and the $94m facility note 21.
The Group has no other material margin requirements on a routine basis.
97 ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 ICAP in ten Business review Governance Financial statements 23 Financial risk management continued c Liquidity risk management continued The cash and cash equivalents balance as at 31 March 2008 of 384.4m includes approximately 260m of cash which is held in the Groups trading subsidiaries to meet regulatory, settlement, margining and other commercial requirements.
The Group invests its cash balances with the objective of optimising the return, while having regard to security, liquidity and counterparty risk.
With the exception of small, local cash management balances, surplus cash is invested with strong investment grade institutions which have an equivalent credit rating of A or better.
The Group invests cash balances in a range of instruments including money market deposits, AAA liquidity funds, government bonds and more structured instruments with the primary aim being capital protection.
Counterparty limits applied are reviewed by the group finance and group risk committees and during the recent financial market turmoil a number of changes have been made to reduce the Groups exposure to institutions perceived as higher risk.
The table below shows the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on the contractual amount payable on the date of repayment: Maturity of financial liabilities as at 31 March 2008 Less than Three months One to Greater than three months to one year five years five years Total m m m m m Matched principal trade creditors 36,906.2 36,906.2 Deposits received for securities loaned 771.4 771.4 Other trade creditors 7.8 7.8 Derivative financial instruments 2.8 15.6 3.0 21.4 Amounts owed by associates 3.4 3.4 Other payables 71.8 71.8 Accruals 267.6 18.0 285.6 Borrowings and overdrafts 347.3 97.1 444.4 Provisions 1.2 3.5 0.6 5.3 38,307.7 90.9 21.6 97.1 38,517.3 Maturity of financial liabilities as at 31 March 2007 Less than Three months One to Greater than three months to one year five years five years Total m m m m m Matched principal trade creditors 82,734.3 82,734.3 Deposits received for securities loaned 778.4 778.4 Other trade creditors 4.1 4.1 Derivative financial instruments 1.1 1.1 Amounts owed by associates 1.4 1.4 Other payables 75.8 11.8 87.6 Accruals 185.6 1.0 17.8 204.4 Borrowings and overdrafts 22.9 183.3 97.8 304.0 Provisions 1.0 2.9 1.4 5.3 Obligations under finance leases 0.1 0.1 83,728.8 79.8 214.3 97.8 84,120.7 The total financial liabilities payable is higher than the amount recognised in trade and other payables as the gross amounts payable have been disclosed, rather than the net present value used in determining trade and other payables.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 98 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial risk management continued d Currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in a number of other currencies principally the dollar and euro.
Consequently the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the Groups transactional revenues and the translation of the earnings and net assets of its overseas operations.
i Transactional exposures The Groups policy is for subsidiaries with sterling functional currency to hedge their two main transactional exposures, which are the dollar and the euro, through a combination of forward FX contracts and options for up to two years forward.
A maximum of 100% of the forecast exposure is hedged for the first 12 months, 75% for the following six months and 25% thereafter.
The Groups other transactional exposures are continually monitored and, where deemed appropriate, hedged for a period of 12 months forward.
The Group aims to achieve hedge accounting wherever possible with any gain or loss on the hedge recognised in equity to the extent it is highly effective and recycled to the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement in accordance with IAS39.
Where hedge accounting is not achieved all fair value gains or losses are immediately recognised in the income statement.
As at 31 March 2008, the Group has contracts in place, designated as cash flow hedges under IAS39 where appropriate, covering approximately 50% of its forecast dollar transactional exposure for the year to 31 March 2009 at $1.99 and 1% of its forecast exposure for the year ending 31 March 2010 at $1.94.
Approximately 75% of the Groups euro exposure has been hedged for the year to 31 March 2009 at 1.40 and 25% of its exposure to 31 March 2010 at 1.32.
In addition, the Group has a number of other contracts in place which allow the Group to participate in any strengthening of the dollar and euro and, when this is the case, the gain or loss is separately recognised in the income statement.
An analysis of the Groups hedging instruments is given in note 23 f. ii Balance sheet translational exposures The Group is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures at the local entity level where the local balance sheet may contain monetary assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency.
It is the Groups policy to hedge up to 100% of these exposures in individual entities using a mix of foreign currency swaps and forward FX contracts and these are designated as fair value hedges under IAS39 where appropriate.
Balance sheet translational exposures also arise on consolidation on the retranslation of the balance sheet of foreign operations into sterling, the Groups reporting currency.
The only significant exposure is to the dollar.
These exposures are viewed as short term in nature and hedging could expose the Group to significant net cash flows and therefore the Groups policy is not to actively hedge these exposures.
However, in order to mitigate this exposure the Group has designated the subordinated loan notes as a hedging instrument against the underlying exposure.
Any gains or losses on revaluation are recognised directly in equity to offset the revaluation of the net investment.
As at 31 March 2008 this exposure was $1.3bn 2007 $1.3bn including intangible assets arising on consolidation, but before $0.3bn of hedging 2007 $0.2bn.
During the year ended 31 March 2008, with respect to sterling, the dollar depreciated by 1% and the euro appreciated by 15%.
In accordance with IAS21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, the resulting translational exchange difference is included within the 2.0m exchange gain taken directly to reserves, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
iii Earnings translation exposures The Group does not hedge the translation of those profits or losses earned by its overseas operations.
The table below shows the anticipated impact on the Groups 2009 results of a 10 cent movement in the dollar and euro in terms of transactional and translational exposure before any hedging activity.

The Groups objective is to minimise interest cost and the impact of interest volatility on the Groups income statement.
The Groups income is exposed to interest rate movements, but estimates that the impact of a 100 basis-points movement in interest rates will not have a material effect on the profit after tax or equity of the Group.

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices on the balance sheet date.
101 ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 ICAP in ten Business review Governance Financial statements 23 Financial risk management continued g Price risk The Groups exposure to price risk arises mainly through counterparties to a matched principal transaction failing to fulfil their obligations or through trade mismatches and other errors and the Groups equity investments.
The Group is also exposed to price risk in respect of its available-for-sale investments.
In matched principal transactions, the Group acts as an intermediary by serving as counterparty for identified buyers and sellers in matching, in whole or in part, reciprocal back-to-back trades.
In order to facilitate customer transactions and provide liquidity, however, the Group may participate in certain marketplaces by posting quotations.
On occasion, the act of posting quotations in pursuit of customer orders can result in the Group becoming principal to unmatched trades.
The risk the Group faces in these situations is restricted to short-term price movements in the underlying instrument temporarily held by the Group and movements in FX rates.
Any such price risk arising is identified, monitored and reported to senior management on a daily basis and to the group risk committee.
Policies and procedures are in place to reduce the likelihood of such trade mismatches and, in the event that they arise, the Groups policy is to liquidate or hedge and liqudate these principal positions as soon as reasonably practicable.
The Group has limited exposure to price risk on its available-for-sale financial assets as the majority of the Groups equity investments are not listed.
The Group estimates that its sensitivity to movements in market price is immaterial.
Company The Companys approach to risk is governed by the overall Group policies on risk, and the limited activities of the Company limit the exposure to risk.
a Financial assets and liabilities All of the Companys financial assets are classified as loans and receivables and the financial liabilities as held at amortised cost.
The fair value of these assets and liabilities is not materially different from their book values.
b Credit risk The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
This risk is considered minimal as all counterparties are Group companies, and the risk of non-payment is remote.
c Liquidity risk management The Company seeks to ensure that it has constant access to an appropriate level of cash and funding to enable it to fund its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost effective and attractive terms.
Cash balances are invested with the objective of optimising return, while having regard to security, liquidity and counterparty risk.
Where the Company has surplus cash it is usually loaned intra-group for further investment.
All of the Companys financial liabilities are payable within one month.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 102 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial risk management continued d Currency risk i Transactional exposures The Company has an immaterial exposure to transactional exposure.
ii Balance sheet translational exposures The Company is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures where the balance sheet contains assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than sterling.
While it is the Groups policy to hedge up to 100% of these exposures at Group level, at company level these exposures can affect the Companys profit after tax.
The table below shows the Companys net financial liabilities denominated in foreign currency and hence the Companys exposure to currency risk: As at 31 March 2008 Dollar Euro Other Total m m m m Net financial liabilities 40.7 40.7 As at 31 March 2007 Dollar Euro Other Total m m m m Net financial liabilities 15.8 15.8 The Company estimates that a 10 cent movement in the dollar exchange rate would result in a translational impact of 2m on the profit after tax of the Company.
e Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate movements as a result of the cash and debt held by the Company.
It is estimated that the impact of a 100 basis-points movement in interest rates would have an effect of 2m on the profit after tax of the Company.

24 Capital management The Group acts as an interdealer broker in international markets and is subject to consolidated supervision by the FSA under the terms of the CRD.
In March 2007, the Group obtained a waiver from the consolidated capital adequacy tests which otherwise would have had the effect of removing intangible assets arising on consolidation from the computation of capital resources.
The Group aims to manage its capital to ensure that entities in the Group meet their local regulatory requirements, while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt which includes borrowings note 21, cash and cash equivalents note 32 and equity note 27.
The Groups finance commitee reviews the capital structure on a regular basis.
As part of this review, the committee considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Based on the recommendations of the committee, the Group balances its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and share buybacks, as well as taking on new debt or refinancing existing debt.
A number of the Groups trading companies are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which they operate, principally by the FSA in the UK and SEC FINRA in the US.
All such companies complied with their regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.

113 ICAP plc Annual Report 2008 ICAP in ten Business review Governance Financial statements 29 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the US and Germany.
In the case of the schemes operating in Germany, any future obligations that the Group may incur in respect of benefits accrued to members for past service are insured with local insurance companies.
The scheme in Germany is not significant in the context of the Group.
The US scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 July 1996 and no benefits have accrued to the members of the scheme in respect of their service after that date.
The scheme provides for pension benefits but does not provide for post-employment medical benefits.
For the purposes of determining the Groups pension cost, the scheme is valued on an annual basis by qualified independent actuaries.
The most recent valuation was as at 1 January 2007 with an update as at 31 March 2008 and used the projected unit method.
The Group expects to contribute 0.6m to its defined benefit pension scheme in the year ending 31 March 2009.
Details of the scheme are provided below.
The actuarial assessment was based on the following principal assumptions: 2008 2007 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries nil nil Rate of increase in pensions in payment nil nil Discount rate 5.8 5.8 Inflation assumption 4.0 3.0 The average life expectancy in years of an individual retiring at the age of 65 at the balance sheet date is as follows: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2008 2007 Years Years Male 17.9 17.9 Female 21.3 21.3 Assumptions regarding mortality rates are calculated based on life expectancy tables which reflect US statutory requirements.
The mortality rates also assume that the average life expectancy of an individual retiring 20 years after the balance sheet date at the age of 65 at the balance sheet date is in accordance with the above table.
The market value of the pension assets and liabilities of the scheme and the expected rate of return are as follows: Long-term Long-term rate of return rate of return expected Value as at expected Value as at 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2008 2008 2007 2007 % m % m Equities 8.5 1.5 8.5 1.6 Bonds 6.0 3.7 6.0 3.6 Cash and other assets 3.8 1.1 3.8 0.7 Total market value of assets 6.3 5.9 Present value of scheme liabilities 7.3 7.3 Deficit in the scheme 1.0 1.4 The expected return on the scheme assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
Expected returns on equities are based on long-term rates previously experienced while yields on bonds are based on gross redemption yields at the balance sheet date.
No sensitivity analysis has been included for any changes to the assumptions used in calculating the scheme liabilities, as such changes would not have a material impact.

30 Contingent liabilities Group a On 27 January 2004 National Australia Bank NAB announced that it incurred FX option trading losses of A$360m 156m.
ICAP plc has received correspondence from NAB alleging that revaluation data, supplied by an individual within one of ICAPs Singapore subsidiaries a member of the TFS-ICAP joint venture, helped NAB traders mask these losses.
The last correspondence to ICAP from NAB on this subject was received on 27 October 2006.
The ICAP Group does not accept any responsibility for NABs trading losses and intends to vigorously contest any claim which may be made against it in relation to this matter.
No provision has been made in the financial statements.
b From time to time the Group is engaged in litigation on employee related and other matters.
The highly regulated nature of the Groups business means that from time to time the Group is subject to regulatory enquiries and investigations, particularly in the US.
The Group is currently involved in a number of these.
Some of these regulatory enquiries and investigations are broad and tend to be interdealer industry wide in nature.
In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has issued a formal order of investigation to ICAP Securities USA LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, and other interdealer brokers in government and other fixed income securities.
ICAP Securities USA LLC is co-operating with the enquiry.
Although ICAP Securities USA LLC has not received notice of an intention by the SEC to bring any charges against ICAP Securities USA LLC or its executives, the potential range of penalties generally available to the SEC include, among other things, financial penalties, disgorgement of profits, fines, actions against individuals, and injunctive and other remedial relief.
Such matters are inherently subject to many uncertainties and the Group cannot predict their outcomes.
However, there are no issues which are currently expected to have a material adverse financial impact on the Groups results or net assets.
c In the normal course of business, certain Group companies enter into guarantees to cover trading arrangements.
Company The Company has provided a subordinated guarantee to a subsidiary company in respect of the $193m subordinated loan notes repayable in 2015 which has a fair value of nil as at 31 March 2008 2007 nil.
