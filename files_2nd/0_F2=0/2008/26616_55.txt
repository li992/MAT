The disposal in the year was in relation to the restructuring of the Groups investment in BlueCrest, which resulted in the Groups holding reducing from 25% to 23%.
The investment in BlueCrest includes goodwill of $194 million 2007: $198 million.
The decrease in the year relates to currency movements.
This is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill with the asset's recoverable amount on an annual basis at the balance sheet date.
A value in use basis is used to calculate the recoverable amount by estimating the future cash flows for net management fee income and net performance fee income and discounting them at an appropriate risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate.
The discount rate applied is 10% and net management fee income is assumed to grow at 5% per annum and net performance fee income is assumed to remain constant no growth.
As a result of these calculations, no impairment was identified.
