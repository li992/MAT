These adjustments have increased goodwill by 1,196,000 and reduced negative goodwill by 1,066,000 and have been reected in the groups results by restating the amounts reported in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet at 31 March 2007.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Education Division Findel Education several CGUs 33,507 33,507 GLS single CGU 11,164 11,164 11 Healthcare Division Nottingham Rehab single CGU 2,278 3,756 11 Home Shopping Division Home Shopping several CGUs 17,482 17,452 11 64,431 65,879 11 The group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and expected changes to revenues and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks in relation to the CGUs.
Changes in revenues and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.
The group prepares cash ow forecasts for the next two to five years derived from the most recent budget information.
Cash ows are extrapolated thereafter based on an estimated growth rate of 3%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash ows is 12%.
The impairment of goodwill of 3m recorded in the year relates to the Nottingham Rehab CGU and arose due to the decision not to renew certain historic contracts.
