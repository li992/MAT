Group overview Directors report: Business review Directors report: Corporate governance Financial statements Note 18.
Assets held for sale On 31 January 2008 and 5 November 2007, the Group entered into sale agreements to dispose of Tullow Congo Ltd and its 40% interest in the Ngosso Permit in Cameroon respectively.
The latter was successfully completed in July 2008.
However, the proposed divestment of Tullow Congo Ltd was not concluded as government approvals for the transfer of the asset were not received within a reasonable timeframe.
The 2007 balance sheet has consequently been restated as the asset is no longer classified as an asset held for sale.
In addition, in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the carrying value of the asset has been adjusted for any depletion or amortisation that would have been recognised had the asset not been originally classified as held for sale.
The impact of the restatement on 2007 net assets is nil and the impact on the income statement is nil.
