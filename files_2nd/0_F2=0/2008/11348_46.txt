Sensitivity to key assumptions IAS 1 requires disclosure of the sensitivity of the results to the methods and assumptions used.
The costs of a pension arrangement require estimates regarding future experience.
The financial assumptions used for IAS 19 reporting are the responsibility of the directors of the Company.
These assumptions reflect market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Changes in market conditions which result in changes in the net discount rate essentially the difference between the discount rate and the assumed rates of increases of salaries, deferred pension revaluation or pensions in payment, can have a significant effect on the value of the liabilities reported.
A reduction in the net discount rate will increase the assessed value of liabilities, as a higher value is placed on benefits paid in the future.
A rise in the net discount rate will have an opposite effect of similar magnitude.
The overall effect of a change in the net discount rate of 0.1% would change the liabilities by around 11.0 million.
There is also uncertainty around life expectancy for the UK population.
The value of current and future pension benefits will depend on how long they are assumed to be in payment.
The disclosures have been prepared using the proposed mortality assumptions basis for the 2007 formal valuation namely the PA00 tables, applying a medium cohort adjustment with a 115% loading to mortality rates based on the year of birth of the membership.
These assumptions imply an assumed life expectancy for a member aged 60 at 31 March 2008 of 25.2 years 2007: 24.6 years for males and 28.0 years 2007: 27.6 years for females.
The effect of increasing the assumed life expectancies by one year would be to increase the value of liabilities by around 2.5%.
Share incentive plans Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP, executive directors and senior managers may receive, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, annual conditional awards of shares in the Company.

The significant inputs to the model were as follows: 31.3.
2007 Dividend yield 3.5% 4.0% Expected share price volatility 24% 22% Share price at award 334.00p 302.75p Expected FTSE 250 index volatility 13% 12% Risk free interest rate 4.6% 5.01% Expected life of option years 3 3 The expected life of these options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
