80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 49 Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies General information Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC the company is a company incorporated in the UK.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the group and equity-account the groups interest in associates and jointly controlled entities.
The parent company financial statements present information about the entity and not about its group.
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year, are discussed in note 2.
In the current year, the group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1 2007.
The impact of IFRS 7 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the groups financial instruments.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new accounting standards, or amendments and interpretations to existing standards have not been applied as they are not yet effective: Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2009 : IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2008 : Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1 2009 : IFRS 8 Operating Segments effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2009 : Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1 2009 and amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1 2009.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group except for additional disclosures.
In addition, certain other standards and interpretations were issued during the period which either do not apply to the group or are not expected to have any material effect.
Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements except for the presentation of segmental information.
The segmental information has been re-analysed to better reflect the system of internal financial reporting to key management and to more accurately reflect the underlying businesses results that are used to assess risk and reward decisions.
As a result the comparative segmental information has been restated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
A joint venture is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise joint control over the financial and operating policies of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Where the group owns a non-controlling interest in the equity share capital of a non-quoted company and does not exercise significant influence, it is held as an investment and stated in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The results of subsidiary and associated undertakings acquired during the year are incorporated from the effective date of acquisition.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method, with consideration given and the assets and liabilities acquired being recorded at fair value.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the groups equity therein.
Minority interests consists of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minority interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 49 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 50 Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The functional and presentation currency of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC and its UK subsidiaries is sterling.
The functional currency of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income statements of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the year and their balance sheets are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences arising on consolidation are taken to equity.
In the event of the disposal of an operation, the related cumulative translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period of disposal.
Gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings and derivative instruments, to the extent that they are used to provide a hedge against the groups equity investments in overseas undertakings, are taken to equity together with the exchange difference arising on the net investment in those undertakings.
All other exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line basis over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Freehold land and buildings 2% Long-term leasehold premises over term of lease Short-term leasehold premises over term of lease Office equipment 11% 33% Motor vehicles 20% All property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units that have benefited from the acquisition.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or where there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro rata basis.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and may not subsequently be reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit and loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on foreign subsidiary investments held in the consolidated balance sheet are retranslated into sterling at the applicable period end exchange rates.
Any exchange differences arising are taken directly to equity as part of the retranslation of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts having been tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP before October 1 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets The group makes an assessment of the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisitions.
An intangible asset will be recognised as long as the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is charged so as to write off the costs of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line or reducing balance method.
50 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 51 1 Accounting policies continued All intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The costs of acquiring and developing software that is not integral to the related hardware is capitalised separately as an intangible asset.
These intangibles are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation Amortisation of intangible assets is provided on a reducing balance basis or straight-line basis as appropriate over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Brands 20 30 years Data providers contracts 5 years Customer relationships 3 16 years Licences and software 3 years Subscription contracts 1 year Business combinations achieved in stages Where a business combination is achieved by more than one exchange transaction, goodwill is calculated separately for each transaction with the appropriate share of the acquirees net assets based on the net fair values at the time of each exchange transaction.
Any adjustment to fair values related to previously held interests is a revaluation which is accounted for as an adjustment to equity.
Purchases and sale of shares in a controlled entity Where the groups interest in a controlled entity increases, which does not result in a change of control, the group calculates the goodwill arising as the difference between the cost of the additional interest acquired and the fair value of the groups interest in the subsidiarys net assets at the date of the change in interest.
All of the assets and liabilities are fair valued at the date of acquisition of the additional controlling stake.
Financial assets Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount, less provision for impairment.
A provision is made and charged to the income statement when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities and equity Committed borrowings and bank overdrafts Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Direct issue costs are amortised over the period of the loans and overdrafts to which they relate.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are charged to the income statement as incurred using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying value of the borrowings or overdraft to the extent they are not settled in the period which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Derivatives financial instruments The group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks, including forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps.
All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value.
The recognition of gains or losses on derivative instruments depends on whether the instrument is designated as a hedge and the type of exposure it is designed to hedge.
The effective portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedges are deferred in equity until the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the income statement.
The ineffective portion of such gains and losses is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 51 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 52 Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Gains or losses on the qualifying part of net investment hedges are recognised in equity together with the gains and losses on the underlying net investment.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
The premium or discount on interest rate instruments is recognised as part of net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Liabilities in respect of put option agreements Liabilities for put options over the remaining minority interests in subsidiaries are recorded in the balance sheet at their estimated discounted present value.
These discounts are unwound and charged to the income statement as notional interest over the period up to the date of the potential future payment.
In respect of options over further interests in joint ventures and associates, only movements in their fair value are recognised.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is calculated under the provisions of IAS 12 Income tax and is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
No provision is made for temporary differences on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates where the group has control and the reversal of the temporary difference is not foreseeable.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If it is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Pensions Contributions to pension schemes in respect of current and past service, ex-gratia pensions, and cost of living adjustments to existing pensions are based on the advice of independent actuaries.
Payments to the Euromoney Pension Plan and the Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan, defined contribution pension schemes, are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The company operates the Metal Bulletin Pension Scheme, a defined benefit scheme.
The cost of providing benefits is determined by triennial valuations using the attained age method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
52 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 53 1 Accounting policies continued The company also participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme which is operated by Daily Mail and General Trust plc.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for the plan as a whole to the individual entities, the company recognises an expense equal to its contributions payable in the period and does not recognise any unfunded liability of this pension scheme on its balance sheet.
Share-based payments The group makes share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
At the period end the vesting assumptions are revisited and the charge associated with the fair value of these options updated.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, IFRS 2 Share-based payments has been applied to all grants of options after November 7 2002, that were unvested at October 1 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
For cash settled share based payments a liability equal to the portion of the goods and services received is recognised at the current fair value as determined at each balance sheet date.
Revenue Revenue represents income from advertising, subscriptions, sponsorship and delegate fees, net of value added tax.
Advertising revenues are recognised in the income statement on the date of publication.
Subscription revenues are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the subscription.
Sponsorship and delegate revenues are recognised in the income statement over the period the event is run.
Revenues invoiced but relating to future periods are deferred and treated as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line or other systematic basis as allowed by IAS 17 Leases.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are approved by the companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Own shares held by Employees Share Ownership Trust Transactions of the group-sponsored trust are included in the group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts holdings of shares in the company are debited direct to equity.
Earnings per share The earnings per share and diluted earnings per share calculations follow the provisions of IAS 33 Earnings per share.
The diluted earnings per share figure is calculated by adjusting for the dilution effect of the exercise of all ordinary share options, SAYE options and the Capital Appreciation Plan options granted by the company, but excluding the ordinary shares held by the Euromoney Employees Share Ownership Trust.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are items of income or expense considered by the directors, either individually or if of a similar type in aggregate, as being either material or significant and which require disclosure in order to provide a view of the groups results excluding these items.
2 Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts The group prepares its group financial statements in accordance with IFRS, the application of which often requires judgements to be made by management when formulating the groups financial position and results.
Under IFRS, the directors are required to adopt those accounting policies most appropriate to the groups circumstances for the purpose of presenting fairly the groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is often required in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the reported results or net asset position of the group should it later be determined that a different choice would have been more appropriate.
Management considers the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed below to be its key judgemental areas and, accordingly, provides an explanation of each below.
Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with the groups audit committee.
The discussion below should also be read in conjunction with the groups disclosure of IFRS accounting policies, which is provided in note 1.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 53 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 54 Notes to the Accounts continued 2 Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts continued Acquisitions The groups accounting policy is that on acquisition of a subsidiary or business, the purchase consideration is allocated over the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, with any excess purchase consideration representing goodwill.
Fair value Determining the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired requires managements judgement and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, recoverability of assets, and unprovided liabilities and commitments particularly in relation to tax and VAT.
Intangible assets The group makes an assessment of the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisitions.
The measurement of the fair value of intangible assets acquired requires significant management judgement particularly in relation to the expected future cash flows from the acquired marketing databases which are generally based on managements estimate of marketing response rates, trademarks, brands, repeat and well established events.
At September 30 2008 the net book value of intangible assets was 135.1 million 2007: 131.5 million.
Goodwill Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
Goodwill is impaired where the carrying value of goodwill is higher than the net present value of future cash flows of those cash generating units to which it relates.
Key areas of judgement in calculating the net present value are the forecast cashflows, the long term growth rate of the applicable businesses and the discount rate applied to those cash flows.
During the year the group recognised a goodwill impairment of 3.0 million note 5 and a reduction in goodwill arising from a deferred tax adjustment of 2.8 million note 5.
Goodwill held on the balance sheet at September 30 2008 was 272.1 million 2007: 248.1 million.
Acquisition option commitments The group is party to a number of put and call options over the remaining minority interests in some of its subsidiaries.
IAS 39 requires the discounted present value of these acquisition option commitments to be recognised as a liability on the balance sheet with a corresponding decrease in reserves.
The discounts are unwound as a notional interest charge to the income statement.
Key areas of judgement in calculating the discounted present value of the options are the expected future cash flows and earnings of the business, the period remaining until the option is exercised and the discount rate.
At September 30 2008 the discounted present value of these acquisition option commitments was 29.8 million 2007: 33.3 million.
The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the groups share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives.
These assumptions are set out in note 23.
Management regularly perform a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest, which is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
The Capital Appreciation Plan is explained in detail in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The number of shares available for award is dependent on the future profits of the group up to at least 2009 which, in addition to the key assumptions above, management are required to estimate.
A fall in the estimate of these profits would result in a lower cumulative charge to the income statement.
The charge for share-based payments for the year ended September 30 2008 is 5.4 million 2007: 10.2 million.
Defined benefit pension scheme The surplus or deficit in the defined benefit pension scheme that is recognised through the statement of recognised income and expense is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties.
The calculated liabilities of the scheme are based on assumptions regarding salary increases, inflation rates, discount rates, the long term expected return on the schemes assets and member longevity.
Details of the assumptions used are shown in note 27.
Such assumptions are based on actuarial advice and are benchmarked against similar pension schemes.
54 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 55 2 Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts continued Taxation The groups tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges.
The calculation of the groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
The group is a multi-national group with tax affairs in many geographical locations.
This inherently leads to a higher than usual complexity to the groups tax structure and makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the group and it is often dependent on the efficiency of the legislative processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in which the group operates.
Issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items.
As a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the income statement and tax payments.
The group has certain significant open items in several tax jurisdictions and as a result the amounts recognised in the group financial statements in respect of these items are derived from the groups best estimation and judgement, as described above.
However, the inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of these items means eventual resolution could differ from the accounting estimates and therefore affect the groups results and cash flows.
Recognition of deferred tax assets The recognition of net deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted.
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Historical differences between forecast and actual taxable profits have not resulted in material adjustments to the recognition of deferred tax assets.
At September 30 2008, the group had a deferred tax asset of 16.5 million 2007: 11.5 million.
Treasury Interest rate exposure Interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its floating rate borrowings.
The maturity profile of these derivatives is matched with the expected future debt profile of the group.
The groups policy is to fix the interest rates on approximately 80% of its term debt looking forward over five years.
The expected future debt profile of the group is based on estimates of both timings and size of future, as yet unknown, acquisitions offset by an estimate of the cash generated by the group over a five year period.
If management materially underestimate the groups future debt profile this would lead to too few interest rate instruments being in place and the group more exposed to swings in interest rates.
An overestimate of the groups future debt profile would lead to associated costs in unwinding the excess interest rate instruments.
At September 30 2008, the fair value of the groups interest rate swaps was a liability 2.9 million 2007: 0.6 million.
Forward contracts The group is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the form of transactions in foreign currencies entered into by group companies and by the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries into sterling for reporting purposes.
The group does not hedge the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries, consequently, fluctuations in the value of pounds sterling versus currencies could materially affect the amount of these items in the consolidated financial statements, even if their values have not changed in their original currency.
The group does endeavour to match foreign currency borrowings to investments in order to provide a natural hedge for the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
Approximately 60% of the groups revenues are in US dollars.
Subsidiaries normally do not hedge transactions in foreign currencies into the functional currency of their own operations.
However, at a group level a series of US dollar forward contracts is put in place up to 48 months forward partially to hedge its dollar revenues into sterling.
The timing and value of these forward contracts is based on managements estimate of its future US dollar revenues over a 48 month period.
If management materially underestimated the groups future US dollar revenues this would lead to too few forward contracts being in place and the group being more exposed to swings in US dollar to sterling exchange rates.
An overestimate of the groups US dollar revenue would lead to associated costs in unwinding the excess forward contracts.
At September 30 2008, the fair value of the groups forward contracts was a liability of 10.9 million 2007: asset of 7.3 million.
Details of the financial instruments used are set out in note 18 to the accounts.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 55 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 56 Notes to the Accounts continued 3 Segmental analysis Primary reporting format Segmental information is presented in respect of the groups business divisions and represent the groups management and internal reporting structure.
The group is organised into five business divisions: Financial publishing: Business publishing: Training: Conferences and seminars: and Databases and information services.
This is considered to be the primary reporting format.
Financial publishing and Business publishing consist primarily of advertising and subscription revenue.
The Training division consists primarily of delegate revenue.
Conferences and seminars consists of both sponsorship income and delegate revenue.
Databases and information services consists of subscription revenue.
A breakdown of the groups revenue by type is set out below.
The presentation of the groups primary reporting format has been re-analysed to better reflect the system of internal financial reporting to key management and to more accurately reflect the underlying businesses results that are used to assess risk and reward decisions.
As a result the comparative split of divisional revenues and operating profits has been restated.
The total revenue and operating profit remains unchanged.
The total revenue and operating profit by geographic source remains unchanged.
Secondary reporting format The group divides the operation of its businesses across three main geographical areas: United Kingdom: North America: and Rest of World which primarily includes Asia.
These geographical areas are considered as the secondary reporting format.
Inter segment sales are charged at prevailing market rates and shown in the eliminations columns below.
1 Operating profit before acquired intangible amortisation, share option expense and exceptional items.
2 Intangible amortisation represents amortisation on acquisition related non-goodwill assets such as brands, database content and trademarks.

A credit of 11,966,000 relating to tax on foreign exchange losses 2007: 1,826,000 has been treated as exceptional as it is hedged by 11,966,000 2007: 1,826,000 of foreign exchange losses on tax equalisation contracts included within net finance costs note 7.
The group presents the above underlying effective tax rate to help users of this report better understand its tax charge.
In this year the group has removed all deferred tax effects of its goodwill and intangibles from the calculation of its underlying effective tax rate.
This is because in the directors opinion the resulting underlying effective tax rate is more representative of the groups longterm tax position.

The key assumptions reflecting past experience and external sources of information in the value in use calculations were: Forecasts by business based on pre-tax cash flows derived from approved budgets for 2009.
Management believe these budgets to be reasonably achievable: Subsequent cash flows for between one and three additional years were increased in line with growth expectations of the applicable business: The pre-tax discount rate used was 9.1%, reflecting the companies weighted average cost of capital: and Long term growth rate assumed to be 3%.

The sale does not result in a tax charge.
Discontinued operations In December 2007 the group received a final payment of 220,000 from the sale of Energy Information Centre Limited, following agreement of their completion accounts.
There is no related tax charge.
Energy Information Centre Limited was sold in April 2007 and was treated as a discontinued operation up to that date.
In May 2008 the group received a final payment of 25,000 from the sale of the business and assets of Systematics International Limited, following agreement of their completion accounts.
The business and net assets of Systematics International Limited was sold in May 2007 and was treated as a discontinued operation up to that date.

Trade receivables beyond 60 days over due are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods and services, determined by reference to past default experience.
Credit terms for customers are determined in individual territories.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the groups customer base being large and diverse.
Due to this, management believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
70 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 71 16 Trade and other receivables continued As of September 30 2008, trade receivables of 17,625,000 2007: 22,846,000 were past due for which the group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
The average age of these receivables is 71 days 2007: 85 days.
The group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The ageing of these trade receivables is as follows: 2008 2007 000s 000s Past due less than a month 9,276 8,932 Past due more than a month but less than two months 3,487 4,116 Past due more than two months but less than three months 2,780 3,128 Past due more than three months 2,082 6,670 17,625 22,846 As at September 30 2008, trade receivables of 9,174,000 2007: 4,314,000 were impaired and provided for.
It was assessed that a portion of the receivables is expected to be recovered.
The ageing of these receivables is as follows: 2008 2007 000s 000s Past due less than a month 346 229 Past due more than a month but less than two months 541 45 Past due more than two months but less than three months 663 89 Past due more than three months 7,624 3,951 9,174 4,314 Movements on the group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2008 2007 000s 000s At October 1 4,287 3,849 Impairment losses recognised 3,662 2,525 Impairment losses reversed 758 1,493 Amounts written off as uncollectible 783 741 Fair values at acquisition 315 Balance at disposal of business 22 Exchange differences 185 146 At September 30 6,593 4,287 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The allowance for doubtful debts does not include individually impaired trade receivables which have been placed under liquidation as these trade receivables are written off directly to the income statement.

As a result the comparative split of derivative assets and liabilities have been restated.
Financial risk management objectives Full details of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the group in relation to financial instruments are set out on pages 51 and 52 of the accounting policies and page 55 of the key judgemental areas.
In summary, the groups tax and treasury committee normally meets twice a year and is responsible for recommending policy to the board.
The groups treasury policies are directed to giving greater certainty of future costs and revenues and ensuring that the group has adequate liquidity for working capital and debt capacity for funding acquisitions.
The treasury department does not act as a profit centre, nor does it undertake any speculative trading activity and it operates within policies and procedures approved by the board.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its floating rate borrowings.
Further details are set out in the interest rate risk section on pages 75 and 76.
Forward contracts are used to manage the groups exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements.
Further details are set out in the foreign exchange rate risk section on page 74.
72 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 73 18 Financial instruments continued Capital risk management The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2007.
The capital structure of the group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 22 and 24 respectively.
Net debt to EBITDA ratio The groups tax and treasury committee reviews the capital structure at least twice a year.
As part of the debt commitments under the loan facility provided by Daily Mail and General Trust plc DMGT, the board has to ensure that net debt to EBITDA does not exceed 5 times in 2008 and 4 times thereafter.
The group expects to remain within these limits.
The net debt to EBITDA ratio at September 30 is as follows: 2008 2007 000s 000s Committed loan facility 184,594 213,559 Loan notes 7,579 11,796 Total debt 192,173 225,355 Cash and cash equivalents 20,179 20,776 Net debt 171,994 204,579 EBITDA 79,221 71,794 Net debt to EBITDA ratio 2.17 2.85 EBITDA earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and also before exceptional items but after the share option expense.
Categories of financial instruments The groups financial assets and liabilities at September 30 are as follows: 2008 2007 000s 000s Financial assets Derivative instruments fair value through profit and loss 138 762 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 1,681 8,713 Loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents 239,743 88,446 241,562 97,921 Financial liabilities Derivative instruments fair value through profit and loss 9,410 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 15,528 1,978 Acquisition option commitments 29,848 33,335 Loans and payables including overdrafts 429,612 303,705 484,398 339,018 Market price risk Market price risk is the possibility that changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates or commodity prices will adversely affect the value of the groups financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
The groups primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by the group for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, currency options and forward exchange contracts are set out in this note and represent the replacement costs calculated using the market rates of interest and exchange at September 30 2008.
The group has no other material market price risks.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
There has been no change to the groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risks during the year.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 73 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 74 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued Foreign exchange rate risk The group is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the form of transactions in foreign currencies entered into by group companies and by the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries into sterling for reporting purposes.
The group does not hedge the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries.
Consequently, fluctuations in the value of sterling versus other currencies could materially affect the translation of these results in the consolidated financial statements.
The group endeavours to match foreign currency borrowings to investments in order to provide a natural hedge for the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries with the related foreign currency interest cost arising from these borrowings providing a partial hedge against the translation of foreign currency profits.
The groups principal foreign exchange exposure is to US Dollar.
The carrying amounts of the groups US Dollar denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 2008 2007 2008 2007 000s 000s 000s 000s US Dollar 319,647 251,450 412,386 325,632 Approximately 60% of the groups revenues are in US dollars.
At a group level a series of US dollar forward contracts are put in place up to 48 months forward partially to hedge its dollar revenues into sterling.
The timing and value of these forward contracts are based on managements estimate of its future US dollar revenues over a 48-month period and is regularly reviewed and revised with any changes in estimates resulting in either additional forward contracts being taken out or existing contracts maturity dates being moved forward or back.
The group also has a significant operation in Canada whose revenues are mainly in US dollars.
At a group level a series of US dollar forward contracts is put in place up to 48 months forward to hedge the operations Canadian cost base.
In addition, each subsidiary is encouraged to invoice sales in its local functional currency where possible.
Forward exchange contracts are gross settled at maturity.
The following table details the groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against US Dollar.
A 10% sensitivity has been determined by the board as the sensitivity rate appropriate when reporting an estimated foreign currency risk internally and represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates at the reporting date.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower.
Where sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency a positive number below indicates an increase in profit and equity.
For a 10% weakening of sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.
Impact of 10% strengthening of sterling against US Dollar 2008 2007 000s 000s Change in profit for the year in income statement 1,652 1,217 Change in equity 606 15 The increase in the change in the loss from the sensitivity analysis is due to the increase of US Dollar working capital.
The reduction in the loss in equity from the sensitivity analysis is due to the increase of net investment value in US Dollar companies and derivatives.
In managements opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk as the year-end exposure does not reflect the exposure during the year.
US Dollar denominated sales are seasonal with higher volumes in September than the average for the financial year resulting in increased receivables at year-end.
Forward foreign exchange contracts It is the policy of the group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts.
These are entered into up to 48 months forward.
The group has designated certain forward contracts as a hedge of its net investment in US subsidiaries which have US Dollar as their functional currency.
Rate used for conversion from USD to GBP is 1.7825 2007: 2.0374 As at September 30 2008, the aggregate amount of unrealised losses under forward foreign exchange contracts deferred in the fair value reserve relating to future revenue transactions is 10,078,000 2007: unrealised gains of 7,331,000.
It is anticipated that the transactions will take place over the next 48 months at which stage the amount deferred in equity will be released in the income statement.
As at September 30 2008 there were no ineffective cashflow or net investment hedges recognised in the income statement.
Interest rate risks The groups borrowings are in both sterling and US dollars with the related interest tied to US and UK LIBOR.
This results in the groups interest charge being at risk to fluctuations in interest rates.
It is the groups policy to hedge approximately 80% of its interest exposure, converting its floating rate debt into fixed debt by means of interest rate swaps.
The maturity dates are spread in order to avoid interest rate basis risk and also to negate short-term changes in interest rates.
The predictability of interest costs is deemed to be more important than the possible opportunity cost foregone of achieving lower interest rates and this hedging strategy has the effect of spreading the groups exposure to fluctuations arising from changes in interest rates and hence protects the groups interest charge against sudden increases in rates but also prevents the group from benefitting immediately from falls in rates.
The groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section on page 77.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 75 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 76 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates at the reporting date.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the groups: Profit for the year ended September 30 2008 would decrease or increase by 420,000 2007: 365,000.
This is mainly attributable to the groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings: and Other equity reserves would decrease or increase by 3,617,000 2007: 3,736,000 mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps.
The groups sensitivity to interest rates has not materially changed during the period mainly due to similar levels of fixed rates.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the discount curves at reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Cash flow hedges US Dollar: Receive floating pay fixed Average contracted Notional fixed interest rate principal amount Fair value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % 000s 000s 000s 000s Less than 1 year 4.08 4.33 30,856 24,541 182 72 1 to 2 years 4.81 4.08 30,856 26,995 866 196 2 to 5 years 4.77 4.88 47,686 41,719 1,745 405 over 5 years 5.42 9,816 312 GBP: Receive floating pay fixed Average contracted Notional fixed interest rate principal amount Fair value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % 000s 000s 000s 000s Less than 1 year 5.61 5.94 14,000 14,000 100 6 1 to 2 years 5.73 5.61 15,000 14,000 23 34 2 to 5 years 5.61 5.65 22,000 32,000 240 41 over 5 years 6.20 5,000 146 The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is LIBOR.
The group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in the income statement over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact the income statement.
76 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 77 18 Financial instruments continued Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group.
The group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign currency risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the amounts outstanding, with and the credit quality of, these counterparties.
For the groups cash and cash equivalents these are principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and for derivative financial instruments DMGT who have treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than AAA.
The group also has credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued income.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the groups large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk of non-payment taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the balance sheet.
The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
Concentration of credit risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year.
Liquidity risk The group has significant intercompany borrowings and is an approved borrower under a DMGT, 300 million revolving multi-currency facility.
This facility requires the group to meet certain covenants based on net debt and profits adjusted for certain non-cash items.
Failure to do so would result in the group being in breach of the facility potentially resulting in the facility being withdrawn or impediment of management decision making by the lender.
Management regularly monitor the covenants and prepare detailed debt forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available and that the covenants are not close or potentially close to breach.
The groups strategy is to use excess operating cash to pay down its debt.
The group has a cash conversion rate the percentage by which cash generated by operations covers operating profit of over 100%, due to much of its subscription, conference and training revenue being paid in advance.
This facility is due to expire in August 2009, however the directors have, subsequent to the year end, agreed to sign a new replacement facility of up to 250 million offered by DMGT.
The terms of the new facility are similar to the existing facility.
Under the DMGT facility, at September 30 2008, the group has 115.4 million of undrawn but committed facilities available to draw upon if required.
This is more than sufficient for the group to meet expected and unexpected short-term working capital requirements.
However, given the level of uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets, there is a risk that the undrawn portion of the facility may be unavailable or withdrawn if DMGT experience funding difficulties themselves, for example if one of DMGTs lenders was to be unable to fulfil its lending commitments.
It is, however, unlikely that this would impact the group as DMGT have a wide range of funding sources, other than bank debt, available to them.
In addition, if DMGT were unable to fulfil its commitment to the group the directors are confident that the group is in a position that would enable it to secure adequate facilities outside of DMGT, albeit at an increased cost to the business due to high interest charges imposed given the crisis in the credit markets.
The following table details the groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities, mainly variable borrowings.
This table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual cash flows of the financial liabilities including both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that the interest rates are floating, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at September 30 2008.
The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the group may be required to settle.

The fair values of derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.

Interest is payable on this facility at a variable rate of between 0.4% and 1.6% above LIBOR dependant on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
The facility expires in August 2009 and the directors have, subsequent to the year end, agreed to sign a new replacement facility of up to 250 million offered by DMGT.
The terms of the new facility are similar to the existing facility with interest payable at a variable rate of between 1.25% and 3.0% above LIBOR dependant on the groups net debt to EBITDA covenant.
As at September 30 2008 there were 115,406,000 2007: 86,441,000 of other uncommitted undrawn facilities directly available to the group.

At September 30 2008 a deferred tax asset of 3,728,000 2007: 1,317,000 has been recognised.
The US losses can be carried forward for a period of 20 years from the date they arose.
The losses have expiry dates up to January 2026.
At the balance sheet date, a net deferred tax asset of 12,731,000 2007: 10,190,000 has been recognised in respect of US tax deductible goodwill amortisation and other overseas short-term timing differences.
The directors are of the opinion that based on recent and forecast trading, it is probable that the level of profits in the future years are sufficient to enable the asset to be recovered.
A deferred tax asset of 1,842,000 has not been recognised in respect of overseas capital losses arising on the sale of the groups 15% interest in LAMP Technologies LLC.
2007: 5,404,000 as the directors do not believe there is sufficient evidence that it is probable they will be recovered.
The unrecognised deferred tax asset in 2007 has been recognised in full in 2008.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 121,912,000 2007: 86,062,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Options granted relate to those that are likely to be issued under the second tranche of the CAP which vest on February 14 2009, three months following the announcement of the companys results.
The number of options granted is provisional and will primarily require a true-up to reflect adjustments of the individual businesses profits during the period to December 31 2008 as required by the remuneration committee.
As such the actual number of options granted could vary from that disclosed.
Capital Appreciation Plan CAP The CAP executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on February 1 2005.
Each of the CAP awards comprises an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company for an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share.
The awards become exercisable on satisfaction of certain performance conditions and lapse to the extent unexercised on September 30 2014.
The initial performance condition increased during 2007 to reflect the acquisition of Metal Bulletin was achieved in the financial year 2007 and the option pool a maximum of 7.5 million shares was allocated between the holders of outstanding awards.
One third of the awards vested on February 14 2008.
The primary performance target was achieved again in 2008 and the second tranche of options will vest in February 2009 subject to the businesses also achieving the secondary performance criteria page 32.
The final tranche will vest in 2010, but only if the primary and secondary performance conditions are again met, otherwise vesting is deferred until both the profit target of 57 million achieved in 2007 is achieved again, and the profits of the individual participants businesses are at least 75% of that achieved in 2007 but no later than by reference to the year ending September 30 2012.
Share Option Schemes The company has 12 share option schemes for which an IFRS2 Share based payments charge has been recognised.
Details of these schemes are set out in the Directors Remuneration report on pages 32 to 33.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are shown below: The executive and Save as You Earn Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the groups share price over a period of 13 years.
The executive options fair values have been discounted at a rate of 10% to reflect their performance conditions.
The expected term of the option used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The expense recognised in the year in respect of these options was 281,000 2007: 202,000.

84 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 85 25 Acquisition option commitments The group is party to a number of put options over the remaining minority interests in some of its subsidiaries.
IAS 39 Financial Instruments requires the recognition of acquisition liabilities.
The group regularly performs a review of the underlying businesses with option commitments and in 2008 the review resulted in a net increase in the fair value of the groups option commitments of 1,730,000 2007: decrease of 3,885,000.
This increase is reported as finance expense in the income statement.
New option commitments of 500,000 have been recognised relating to subsidiaries acquired in the year and existing options have been exercised totalling 6,919,000.
As at September 30 2008, the discounted present value of the remaining put option commitments is 29,848,000 2007: 33,335,000.
These discounts are unwound as a notional interest charge to the income statement.
26 Commitments At September 30 the group has committed to make the following payments in respect of operating leases on land and buildings: 2008 2007 000s 000s Within 1 year 5,623 4,764 Between 2 and 5 years 18,519 16,213 After 5 years 15,619 19,385 39,761 40,362 The groups operating leases do not include any significant leasing terms or conditions.

It also participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, a defined benefit scheme which is operated by Daily Mail and General Trust plc DMGT but is accounted for in Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC as a defined contribution scheme.
The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes for the year ended September 30 comprised: 2008 2007 000s 000s Euromoney Pension Plan 575 460 Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan 39 63 Private schemes 801 596 Harmsworth Pension Scheme 203 184 1,618 1,303 Euromoney PensionSaver and Euromoney Pension Plan Euromoney PensionSaver was launched on October 1 2008 to replace the Euromoney Pension Plan as the principal pension arrangement offered to employees of the group.
Under both plans, contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
However, Euromoney PensionSaver is a group personal pension arrangement rather than the trust-based arrangement used by the Euromoney Pension Plan.
The Euromoney Pension Plan is a part of the DMGT Pension Trust, an umbrella trust under which DMGT UK trust-based defined contribution plans are held.
Insured death benefits previously held under this trust have been transferred to a new trust-based arrangement specifically for life assurance purposes.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 85 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 86 Notes to the Accounts continued 27 Retirement benefit schemes continued Active members of the Euromoney Pension Plan have been given the opportunity to join and transfer their assets to Euromoney PensionSaver.
Following these transfers, all assets remaining in the Euromoney Pension Plan will be transferred out before the Plan is wound up.
Assets of both plans are invested in funds selected by members and held independently from the companys finances.
The investment and administration of both plans is undertaken by Fidelity Pension Management.
Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan The Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan is a defined contribution arrangement under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
The scheme is closed to new members.
The plan is contracted-in to the State Second Pension and its assets are invested under trust in funds selected by members and held independently from the companys finances.
The investment and administration of the plan is undertaken by Skandia Life Group.
Private schemes Institutional Investor, Inc. contributes to a 401 k savings and investment plan for its employees which is administered by an independent investment provider.
Employees are able to contribute up to 15% of salary with the company matching up to 50% of the employee contributions, up to 5% of salary.
Stakeholder pensions The company provides access to a stakeholder pension plan for relevant employees who are not eligible for other pension schemes operated by the group.
Harmsworth Pension Scheme The Harmsworth Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme operated by DMGT providing service-related benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held independently from the companys finances and are administered by a trustee company.
The scheme is no longer offered to new employees of the company.
The contributions payable to the scheme are determined by the trustee company after taking advice from an independent qualified actuary, and following agreement with the company.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme, upon which the current contributions are based, was carried out as at March 31 2007 using the projected unit credit method.
On November 30 2007 the members, assets and liabilities of the Mail Newspapers Pension Scheme MNPS were merged into the Harmsworth Pension Scheme.
As a condition of the merger, DMGT, as the principal employer, has provided letters of credit for 40 million to cover the period to December 1 2011.
The trustee would have a call on this contingent asset in the event that the newly combined scheme begins to be wound up before December 1 2011 and the assets of the scheme are insufficient to provide benefits in full for all members.
The funding strategy agreed with the trustee made allowance for assumed future investment returns on the schemes assets of 3.3% p. a. above price inflation, compared with the real return of some 2.6% p. a. implicit within the calculation of the Technical Provisions i. e. the value of the schemes benefit liabilities.
DMGT agreed with the trustee that this margin would be covered by a contingent asset and DMGT has put in place a letter of credit to be updated annually of an amount sufficient to cover any potential shortfall in this additional investment return arising prior to the next triennial valuation.
As at September 28 2008 the letter of credit had a value of 21.8 million 2007: nil.
In addition the company is paying annual cash contributions of 18% of members scheme salaries 2007: 18%.
Other key financial assumptions adopted were as follows: Long-term assumed rate of: 2008 2007 Price inflation 3.0% p. a.
Pension increases on excess over guaranteed minimum pension 3.0% p. a.
Discount rate for accrued liabilities - Pre-retirement 6.4% p. a.
The financial assumptions shown above used in the most recent actuarial valuation were selected to provide a basis for funding the schemes and are not intended to reflect the companys experience or policy regarding pay in any one financial year.
The valuation of the scheme showed that the combined accumulated assets of the scheme as at March 31 2007 represented 99% of the schemes Technical Provisions in respect of past service benefits.
86 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 87 27 Retirement benefit schemes continued Members are able to make additional voluntary contributions AVCs into unit-linked funds held within each scheme.
No benefit obligation arises to the DMGT, or the company, from these AVCs and the related unit-linked AVC assets have been excluded from the valuation of assets and liabilities reported below.
The groups pension charge for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme for the year ended September 30 2008 was 203,000 2007: 184,000.
Included in debtors in 2007 is an advance payment into the pension schemes amounting to 143,000.
In accordance with the provisions of the contribution schedules for the schemes, the company has not made an advance payment in 2008 but will be making regular monthly contribution payments from October 2008.
The group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme.
The scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with no segregation of the assets to individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all participating employers i. e. the contribution rate charged to each employer is affected by the experience of the schemes as a whole.
The scheme is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the company.
This means that the pension charge reported in these financial statements is the same as the cash contributions due in the period.
The ultimate parent company, DMGT, is required to account for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The IAS 19 disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts of DMGT have been based on calculations performed as part of the work being carried out for the formal valuation of the scheme as at March 31 2007, and adjusted to September 30 2008 by the actuary.
The calculations are adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by IAS 19.
These showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 1,322.5 million 2007: 650.0 million and that the actuarial value of these assets represented 99% 2007: 106% of the benefits that had accrued to members also calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
Defined benefit scheme The company operates the Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme closed to new members, a defined benefit scheme.
Metal Bulletin Pension Scheme The acquisition by the group of Metal Bulletin plc on October 6 2006 included a defined benefit obligation in respect of the Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme MBPS.
As a result, at that date the company acquired a defined benefit obligation of 21.7 million along with a fair value of pension scheme assets of 17.7 million resulting in a net pension liability of 4.0 million.
The impact of the acquisition of MBPS on the balance sheet disclosures, and the subsequent pension costs arising, are included in the figures reported below.
The MBPS is a defined benefit scheme providing service-related benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held independently from the companys finances, being invested with the Norwich Union Life Insurance Society, Schroder Investment Management Ltd, and certain other specific investments managed directly by the Trustees.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the group.
The contributions are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the attained age method.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme, upon which the current contributions are based, was carried out as at June 1 2007.
The company cash contribution rate to the scheme during the year was 22.8% 2007: 22.8% of pensionable salaries.
This MBPS is closed to new members.
The figures in this note are based on calculations carried out in connection with the actuarial valuation of the scheme as at June 1 2007 and adjusted to September 30 2008 by the actuary.
The key financial assumptions adopted were as follows: Long-term assumed rate of: 2008 2007 Pensionable salary growth 5.0% p. a.
Pension escalation in payment pre January 1997 members 5.0% p. a.
Pension escalation in payment pensions earned from May 30 2002 to June 30 2006 post January 1997 members 3.7% p. a.
Pension escalation in payment pensions earned from June 30 2006 post January 1997 members 2.5% p. a.
Discount rate for accrued liabilities 7.0% p. a.
Pension increase in deferment 3.7% p. a.
The discount rate for scheme liabilities reflects yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds.
All assumptions were selected after taking actuarial advice.

Having taken account of the rules of the scheme, the fact that the scheme remains open to new accrual, and the current levels of service cost and cash contributions, the company considers that recognition of the schemes surplus on its balance sheet is in accordance with the interpretations of IFRIC 14.
The surplus for the year excludes a related deferred tax liability of 708,000 2007: 109,000.
