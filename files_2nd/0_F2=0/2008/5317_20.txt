7 Share-based payments The Group has a number of share-based incentive plans for employees.
These comprise an Executive Incentive Plan EIP awarded to the Groups most senior executives, a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awarded to senior managers and employees, a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme that is made available to the majority of employees and a US s423 option scheme that is offered to all permanent employees in the US operating company.
In addition there was a Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP operated until 2005, awarding options to senior managers.
The LTIOP and SAYE schemes were in operation before 7 November 2002 in addition to a pre-existing Long Term Incentive Plan.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have only been applied to grants made, under all these schemes, after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
Executive Incentive Plan EIP The EIP scheme principally comprises a one-off conditional award on 1 February 2006 of shares to the 12 most senior executives in the Group to be delivered following the financial year ending 31 March 2009.
The number of shares to be awarded is dependent on the performance of the Group during the year ending 31 March 2009 varying between 0 and 2,700,000.
The estimate of the Groups performance for the year ending 31 March 2009 is updated periodically.
The estimate was revised accordingly as at the year ended 31 March 2008 and resulted in a release of 0.6m during the year.
The awards include a right to receive dividend equivalents on vesting.
Awards over 450,000 of these shares were made for cash settlement.
During 2007 further options for new senior executives totalling 221,000 options were granted.
The fair value of the EIP options was calculated using a Black-Scholes model based on the assumptions below.

Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 41 Notes to the Group Accounts continued 7 Share-based payments continued Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIOP schemes were awarded to key senior employees at a grant price equal to the Groups share price.
The vesting conditions include a continuation of service, a minimum of three years, and the performance of the Groups shares against a comparator group.
The share price is tested against this group after three years and can be retested after four and five years if the options have not vested.
The proportion of the options vesting is also dependent on the comparative share performance.
The share options can be exercised up to 10 years after the grant date.
Any options remaining unexercised after 10 years from the date of grant will expire.
In June 2006 a new executive plan the LTIP conditional award of shares was made.
The vesting conditions are based on performance of the Group versus the FTSE 250 over the three year life of the scheme.
At the vesting date the share award will either vest or lapse.
In June 2007 a further conditional award of shares was made.
The fair value of the LTIOP and LTIP options was calculated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo model based on the assumptions below.
