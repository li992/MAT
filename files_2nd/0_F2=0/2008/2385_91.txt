BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes on financial statements 36.
Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt The group defines capital as the total equity of the group.
The groups objective for managing capital is to deliver competitive, secure and sustainable returns to maximize long-term shareholder value.
BP is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
The groups approach to managing capital is set out in its financial framework.
The group aims to balance returns to shareholders between long-term growth and current returns via the dividend whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking action on costs to respond to the current environment.
At the beginning of 2008, the group rebalanced returns to shareholders by increasing the dividend component.
As a result, the share buyback programme was curtailed and then suspended in September in light of the uncertain environment.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is claimed, less cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt and net debt ratio are non-GAAP measures.
BP uses these measures to provide useful information to investors.
Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total.
The net debt ratio enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to equity from shareholders.
The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings Derivative financial instruments.
All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.
We believe that a net debt ratio in the range 20-30% provides an efficient capital structure and an appropriate level of financial flexibility.
