Valuations were based on current prices in an active market for all properties.
The property valuations were carried out by Allsop & Co for the UK and Swedish properties and DTZ Debenham Tie Leung for the French and German properties, who are external, professionally qualified valuers.
Investment property includes buildings held under finance leases of which the carrying amount is 20,804 thousand 2007: 113,308 thousand.
Where the Group leases out its investment property under operating leases the duration is typically 3 years or more.
No contingent rents have been recognised in the current or comparative year.
Investment properties and the owner occupied property detailed in Note 15 are pledged as collateral against debt used to acquire the respective property as disclosed in Note 27.
As referred to in the Chairman's Statement on page 5, the current economic climate and lower transactional volumes in the real estate markets in which CLS is active has meant that our valuers have referred to greater use of professional judgement in arriving at the year end valuations.
In addition, the fact that the Group is not a distressed seller may mean realising assets at these values by way of sale in the short term may be difficult to achieve as the transactions that are being completed are generally at distressed levels, rather than indicative of a willing buyer and seller.
Given the smaller individual lot sizes, the tenant base and the geographic spread of the CLS portfolio which should mitigate such volatility, the Directors are satisfied that the external valuations supplied are appropriate to adopt for these financial statements without adjustment.
