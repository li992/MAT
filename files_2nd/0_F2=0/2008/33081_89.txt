Vodafone Additional Information Non-GAAP Information Group adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share Group adjusted operating profit excludes non-operating income of associates, impairment losses and other income and expense.
Adjusted earnings per share also excludes changes in fair value of equity put rights and similar arrangements and certain foreign exchange differences, together with related tax effects.
The Group believes that it is both useful and necessary to report these measures for the following reasons: these measures are used by the Group for internal performance analysis: these measures are used in setting director and management remuneration: it is useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies: and adjusted operating profit is used as the Groups measure of segment performance.
Reconciliation of adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit loss and basic earnings loss per share, is provided in Operating Results beginning on page 32.
Cash flow measures In presenting and discussing the Groups reported results, free cash flow and operating free cash flow are calculated and presented even though these measures are not recognised within IFRS.
The Group believes that it is both useful and necessary to communicate free cash flow to investors and other interested parties, for the following reasons: free cash flow allows the Company and external parties to evaluate the Groups liquidity and the cash generated by the Groups operations.
Free cash flow does not include items determined independently of the ongoing business, such as the level of dividends, and items which are deemed discretionary, such as cash flows relating to acquisitions and disposals or financing activities.
In addition, it does not necessarily reflect the amounts which the Group has an obligation to incur.
However, it does reflect the cash available for such discretionary activities, to strengthen the Consolidated Balance Sheet or to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends or share purchases: free cash flow facilitates comparability of results with other companies, although the Groups measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies: these measures are used by management for planning, reporting and incentive purposes: and these measures are useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.
A reconciliation of net cash inflow from operating activities, the closest equivalent GAAP measure, to operating free cash flow and free cash flow, is provided in Financial Position and Resources on page 55.
Other Certain of the statements within the section titled Chief Executives Review on pages 4 to 7 contain forward-looking non-GAAP financial information for which at this time there is no comparable GAAP measure and which at this time cannot be quantitatively reconciled to comparable GAAP financial information.
Certain of the statements within the section titled Outlook on page 51 contain forward-looking non-GAAP financial information which at this time cannot be quantitatively reconciled to comparable GAAP financial information.
Organic growth The Group believes that organic growth, which is not intended to be a substitute, or superior to, reported growth, provides useful and necessary information to investors and other interested parties for the following reasons: it provides additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of factors unrelated to the operating performance of the business: it is used by the Group for internal performance analysis: and it facilitates comparability of underlying growth with other companies, although the term organic is not a defined term under IFRS and may not, therefore, be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
