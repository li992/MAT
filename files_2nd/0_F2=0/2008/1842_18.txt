Prior year adjustment IAS2 Inventories and IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement require that the Groups land purchases on deferred terms should be recorded at the discounted present value at the date of purchase.
The value of the discount is expensed through finance costs in the income statement over the period of the deferral, with the associated land payable being increased to the settlement value over the period of deferral.
The land value carried in inventories is reduced by the value of the discount and this therefore reduces land cost of sales in the income statement over the duration of the site.
The Group adopted the above policy upon transition to IFRS at 1 July 2004.
The calculation methodology adopted at transition, and subsequently applied, did not discount any deferred term land payable at inception for the first twelve months that it was due to remain outstanding.
The Group has reviewed this calculation methodology in the current year and considers that it is appropriate to discount any deferred term land payable for the entire period of deferral.
The Group has therefore recalculated the adjustment made for deferred term land payables and, due to the fact that the impact of the change is considered by the Directors to be material, it has adjusted the results presented at 30 June 2007 by means of a prior year adjustment.
The effect of this calculation change is summarised below: Year ended At 30 June 2007 1 July 2006 m m Income statement Cost of sales 6.1 Finance costs 9.1 Decrease in profit before tax 3.0 Tax 0.9 Decrease in profit for the period 2.1 Balance sheet Deferred tax asset 2.5 4.7 Non-current assets 2.5 4.7 Inventories 29.7 34.8 Current assets 29.7 34.8 Trade and other payables 11.1 19.2 Deferred tax liabilities 3.1 Non-current liabilities 14.2 19.2 Net assets 13.0 10.9 Equity Retained profits at the start of the period 10.9 10.9 Retained profit movement in the period 2.1 Equity 13.0 10.9 Earnings per share Basic 0.8p Diluted 0.8p Barratt Developments 56 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 | Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 2.

Exceptional costs Impairment of inventories At 30 June 2008, the Group conducted a review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying values of its sites in the light of the current deterioration in the UK housing market.
Where the estimated future net present realisable value of the site was less than its carrying value within the balance sheet the Group has impaired the land and work in progress value.
This has resulted in an impairment of 208.4m.
Further details on this impairment are given in note 19.
Impairment of goodwill At 30 June 2008, the Group conducted an impairment review of its goodwill as explained in note 12.
This resulted in an impairment charge of 24.5m for the year.
Impairment of intangible assets At 30 June 2008, the Group conducted an impairment review of its brands as explained in note 13.
This resulted in an impairment charge of 6.2m for the year.
Restructuring costs During the year ended 30 June 2008, the Group has incurred 15.9m 2007: 26.2m of costs in relation to reorganising and restructuring the business, including redundancy costs of 3.7m 2007: 12.2m where existing employees could not be retained within the Group.

In addition to the amount charged to the income statement, deferred tax of 3.1m 2007: 2.5m charged was credited directly to equity note 18 and corporation tax of nil 2007: 3.3m was credited directly to equity.
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is higher 2007: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for the period of 29.5% 2007: 30.0%.
The differences are explained below: 2008 2007 restated m m Profit before tax 137.3 424.8 Profit before tax multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax of 29.5% 2007: 30.0% 40.5 127.4 Effects of: Goodwill impairment not deductible for tax purposes 7.2 Other expenses not deductible for tax purposes 7.1 2.7 Additional tax relief for land remediation costs 1.9 1.7 Adjustment in respect of previous years 2.8 Tax in respect of joint ventures 0.8 Impact of change in rate on future deferred tax balances 1.9 Tax charge for the year 50.9 126.5 The results for the year ended 30 June 2007 have been restated as explained in note 1.
The impact of the change introduced in the Finance Act 2007 regarding the reduction in the corporation tax rate from April 2008 from 30% to 28% has been incorporated into the Groups tax charge and deferred tax provided.
At 30 June 2007, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of 5.8m in relation to the anticipated tax relief available on the future exercise of options under the Barratt Share Option and Long-Term Performance Plans.
As a result of the fall in the Companys share price since that date, the anticipated tax relief on future exercises is now lower and accordingly the attributable deferred tax asset recognised as at 30 June 2008 is nil.
This has resulted in a charge to the income statement of 3.3m, included within other expenses not deductible for tax purposes in the table above, the balance being charged to equity.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of 86.4m 2007: 298.3m restated by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust which are treated as cancelled, which were 345.0m 2007: 258.6m.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of 86.4m 2007: 298.3m restated by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares from the start of the year, giving a figure of 346.7m 2007: 262.8m.

The Group conducts its annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for both the housebuilding and commercial developments segments.
Any impairment identified is allocated first to goodwill and then to intangible assets.
The impairment review was performed at 30 June 2008 and compared the value-in-use of the housebuilding and commercial developments segments with the carrying value of their tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill.
Barratt Developments Annual Report and Accounts 2008 63 | Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 12.
Goodwill continued The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the housebuilding and commercial developments segments.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were those regarding the discount rates, expected changes in selling prices and sales volumes for completed houses and expected changes in site costs to complete.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the housebuilding and commercial developments businesses and therefore the discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is a pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate of 10% being the Groups estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Changes in selling prices, sales volumes and direct costs are based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market taking into account external market forecasts.
The Directors have used the Groups current budget and internal forecasts for the first five years of the forecast cash flows.
Following year five, the Group extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2.5%, which is based upon the expected long-term growth rate of the UK economy.
As a result of this review the Group has fully impaired the goodwill of the commercial developments business by 24.5m reflecting declining commercial property yields and the impact upon the future profit stream of the business.
The impairment has been recognised within exceptional administrative expenses in the income statement.

The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments valued at 7.0m prior to amortisation was being amortised over ten years as it is a business-to-business brand operating in niche markets.
The Group tests indefinite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.
An impairment review was conducted using the calculations and assumptions as explained in note 12.
As a result of this review an impairment of 6.2m has been recorded in relation to the Wilson Bowden Developments brand to reduce the carrying value of this asset to nil.
This impairment has been recognised within exceptional administrative expenses in the income statement.

These loans are held at the present value of expected future cash flows taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated time of repayment.
The fair value reduction during the year has been recognised in equity to the extent that it was previously credited to equity 4.6m, and then subsequently charged to the income statement as an impairment 9.5m.
The impairment of available for sale financial assets arises due to the impact on the fair value of these assets of the decline in UK house prices.
Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in note 24.

Deferred tax continued It is not anticipated that any of the deferred tax liability in respect of the brands will reverse in the twelve months following the balance sheet date.
Whilst it is anticipated that an element of the remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse during the twelve months following the balance sheet date, at present it is not possible to quantify the value of these reversals.
In addition to the above, the Group has not recorded a deferred tax asset of 1.8m 2007: 1.8m in respect of capital and other losses that are not considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.

The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Groups operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within twelve months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be subject to a number of issues such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
At 30 June 2008, the Group conducted a review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying values of its sites in the light of the current deterioration in the UK housing market.
Where the estimated future net present realisable value of the site was less than its carrying value within the balance sheet, the Group has impaired the land and work in progress values.
This has resulted in an exceptional impairment of 208.4m.
The key judgement in estimating the future profit stream is the evaluation of the likely sales prices.
Following this impairment 557.0m 2007: nil of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
The value of inventories expensed in 2008 and included in cost of sales was 2,714.2m 2007: 2,348.3m restated including 10.4m 2007: 3.5m of inventory write-downs incurred in the course of normal trading and a reversal of 5.4m 2007: 1.4m on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period, but excluding the 208.4m exceptional impairment.
The 5.4m reversal arose mainly due to obtaining planning approval on strategic land and other interests that had previously been written down to net realisable value.
The value of inventories written down and recognised as an expense in 2008 totalled 218.8m 2007: 3.5m, being the 208.4m classified as an exceptional cost and the remaining 10.4m incurred in the normal course of trading.
The Company has no inventories.

The one-year term out option was exercised by the Company on 26 April 2008 and the facility expires on 25 April 2009.
This facility was originally 800m, but during the year 200m has been repaid through refinancing and the relevant proportion of the facility has been cancelled.
A committed 529.4m five-year term facility, which was fully utilised at 30 June 2008 by way of drawings of 483m and a bank guarantee to support the loan notes of 46.4m, which was effective from 26 April 2007.
The facility was originally 600m but during the year 55.2m of the loan notes have been repaid and 15.4m of the facility has been cancelled.
A committed 750m five-year revolving credit facility of which 70m was drawn at 30 June 2008, effective from 26 April 2007.
A committed 400m five-year revolving credit facility of which 210m was drawn at 30 June 2008, effective from 2 February 2005. ii Fixed rate sterling private placement notes The Group has 125.5m of sterling fixed rate private placement notes.
20.5m of these are carried at their fair value as at the date of acquisition of Wilson Bowden and expire on 15 October 2010.
A further 60m of private placement notes, which at 30 June 2007 were also carried at the fair value established at the acquisition of Wilson Bowden, were on 23 April 2008 extended so that 30m expires on 23 April 2018 and 30m expires on 23 April 2020.
These private placement notes are therefore now carried at historical cost.
In addition, on 23 April 2008 45m of new sterling fixed rate private placement notes were issued by the Company.
iii Fixed rate US Dollar private placement notes US Dollar ten-year private placement notes of $65m and five-year private placement notes of $35m, a total of $100m effective from 23 April 2008.
A US Dollar ten-year private placement note of $200m effective from 23 August 2007.

Financial liabilities continued vi Developments relating to committed facilities and private placement notes On 9 July 2008, the Company entered into a 400m three-year committed revolving credit facility.
In addition, 350m of the existing 400m five-year revolving credit facility effective from 2 February 2005 was extended on 6 August 2008 to match the maturity period of the new three-year 400m revolving credit facility.
The remaining 50m of this facility expires on 1 February 2010.
On 9 July 2008, the Company agreed with its bankers and private placement investors to amend the financial covenants to support the Group through the current difficult economic climate.
The amendments were signed on 5 August 2008 and all conditions precedent were satisfied on 6 August 2008.
From 6 August 2008 the weighted average interest rate paid by the Group increased to circa 9.75%.
c Net debt Net debt is defined as cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts and interest bearing borrowings.
Derivative financial instruments swaps The Group and Company have entered into derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risks as explained in note 27.
Neither the Group nor the Company enter into any derivatives for speculative purposes.

All of the Groups and Companys interest rate swap arrangements contain a clause that allows the Group Company or the issuer to cancel the swap in May 2012 at fair value.
As at 30 June 2008 the Group and Company had outstanding floating rate sterling debt and overdrafts of 1,409.2m 2007: 1,401.5m.
In obtaining this funding the Group and Company sought to achieve certainty as to both the availability of, and income statement charge related to, a designated proportion of anticipated future debt requirements.

Derivative financial instruments swaps continued a Interest rate swaps continued The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap 765.0m 2007: 860.0m of this debt into fixed rate sterling debt in accordance with the Group and Company treasury policy outlined in note 27.
The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 30 June 2008, which is based on third party valuations, was a liability of 6.8m 2007: 12.3m asset with a loss of 19.1m 2007: 12.3m gain charged directly to equity in the year.
There was no ineffectiveness to be taken through the income statement during the year or the prior year.
Swaps with a notional amount of 95.0m were cancelled during the year on the refinancing of part of the Groups and Companys sterling borrowings.
Cumulative losses on these swaps of 3.6m were deferred in equity as the forecast transaction specified in the hedge relationship is still expected to occur.
These losses will be recognised in the income statement over the period the forecast transaction occurs: 0.1m of the loss was recognised in the income statement in the year, and a balance of 3.5m remains deferred in equity.
Further disclosures relating to financial instruments are set out in note 27. b Foreign exchange swaps The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks, related to foreign exchange, arising from the Groups sources of finance denominated in US Dollars.
As at 30 June 2008 the Group and Company had outstanding fixed rate US Dollar loan notes of $300m 2007: $nil.
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap all of this debt into fixed rate sterling debt in accordance with the Group treasury policy outlined in note 27.
After taking into account swap arrangements the fixed interest rates applicable to the debt were as follows: Fixed Amount rate payable $m % Maturity 35.0 8.98 2013 200.0 6.61 2017 65.0 9.24 2018 300.0 The swap arrangements are designated as cash flow hedges against future foreign exchange rate movements.
The hedges match the contractual initial receipt, the final settlement, as well as all interest payments.
The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 30 June 2008, which is based on third party valuations, was an asset of 7.4m 2007: nil with a gain of 7.4m 2007: nil credited directly to equity in the year.

Financial risk management The Groups financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 24, 25 and 26.
The Groups operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates.
The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and as such there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management so as to ensure that risks are promptly identified and appropriate actions taken by the central Treasury Department.
In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to fix interest rates and currency rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board of Directors is responsible for setting specific, clearly defined guidelines regarding treasury that are applied by the Group.
The Group has a Treasury Operating Committee which operates within specific parameters set by the Board and consists of any two of the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Treasurer.
In addition, the Board approves and reviews all facilities and derivative transactions that they have not delegated to the Treasury Operating Committee.
The Group operates a central Treasury Department to implement the guidelines established by the Board, to whom it reports regularly.
a Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.
The Groups borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and as such the Group maintains sufficient headroom to cover these requirements.
On a normal operating basis the Group has a policy of maintaining headroom of 250m of available committed facilities and identifies and takes appropriate actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations.
This represents 65.9% 2007: 56.4% of available committed facilities.
The Groups objective is to minimise refinancing risk.
The Group therefore has a policy that the maturity of its committed facilities and private placement notes is at least three years on average.
At 30 June 2008, the average maturity of the Groups facilities was 3.3 years 2007: 3.5 years.
As explained in note 25, on 9 July 2008, the Company entered into a new 400m three-year facility and agreed to extend subject to contract 350m of the existing 400m revolving credit facility to further minimise refinancing risk.
All conditions precedent were satisfied on 6 August 2008.
The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities, excluding derivative financial liabilities, by remaining contractual maturity at the balance sheet date are as follows: Carrying Contractual Less than 1 1-2 2-5 Over 5 amount cash flows year years years years Group Note m m m m m m 30 June 2008 Loans and borrowings 25 1,685.2 2,099.3 758.9 280.8 725.3 334.3 Trade and other payables 25 1,155.9 1,204.6 922.2 144.3 119.6 18.5 2,841.1 3,303.9 1,681.1 425.1 844.9 352.8 30 June 2007 Loans and borrowings 25 1,483.3 1,790.9 230.7 940.1 620.1 Trade and other payables 25 1,221.9 1,265.4 1,136.0 57.4 53.5 18.5 2,705.2 3,056.3 1,366.7 997.5 673.6 18.5 Barratt Developments Annual Report and Accounts 2008 77 | Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 27.

b Market risk price risk i UK housing market risk This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group balance sheet.
The Groups earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices.
UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates and consumer confidence.
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy.
However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographical spread of operating divisions and appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions.
The Groups management of operational risks is detailed in the Business review on page 15.
The UK housing market affects the valuation of the Groups non-financial assets and liabilities, notably land and work in progress, and the critical judgements applied by management in these financial statements, which include the valuation of land and work in progress, are detailed on page 55.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities that are directly linked to the UK housing market are as follows: Linked to UK Not linked to UK housing market housing market Total Group m m m 30 June 2008 Non-derivative financial assets 66.9 84.6 151.5 Non-derivative financial liabilities 2,841.1 2,841.1 Derivatives 0.6 0.6 66.9 2,755.9 2,689.0 30 June 2007 Non-derivative financial assets 37.3 273.9 311.2 Non-derivative financial liabilities 2,705.2 2,705.2 Derivatives 12.3 12.3 37.3 2,419.0 2,381.7 The value of the Groups available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market.
At 30 June 2008 these were carried at a fair value of 66.9m 2007: 37.3m.
The Company has no financial assets and liabilities that are directly linked to the UK housing market.
Sensitivity analysis At 30 June 2008, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial assets and liabilities would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by 14.9m 2007: 1.9m with a corresponding reduction in both net profit and equity.
ii Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term fixed rate funding and medium-term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate flexibility for the Groups operational requirements.
In order to achieve this the Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash flow risks relating to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of sterling and US Dollar private placements.

The floating rates are fixed in advance for periods generally ranging from one to six months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2008 was 6.6% 2007: 5.7%.
Sterling private placement notes of 125.5m 2007: 81.8m were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate sterling private placement notes for 2008 was 7.8% 2007: 7.5% with, at 30 June 2008, a weighted average period of 9.5 years 2007: 2.5 years for which the rate is fixed.
US Dollar private placement notes of 150.5m 2007: nil were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar private placement notes, after the effect of foreign exchange rate swaps, for 2008 was 6.9% 2007: nil with, at 30 June 2008, a weighted average period of 8.8 years 2007: nil for which the rate is fixed.
Sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2008, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups pre-tax profit would decrease increase by 4.8m 2007: 2.8m, the Groups post-tax profit would decrease increase by 3.4m 2007: 2.0m and the Groups equity would decrease increase by 3.4m 2007: 2.0m.

Financial risk management continued b Market risk price risk continued iii Foreign exchange rate risk The Group has fixed rate US Dollar private placement notes of $300m 2007: $nil.
In order to mitigate risks associated with the movement in the foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging its US Dollar denominated debt.
The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements on the issue of its US Dollar denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges.
Details of the Groups foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 26.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk may be summarised as follows: 2008 2007 $m $m US Dollar loan notes 300.0 Derivative financial instruments foreign exchange swaps 300.0 Net exposure Sensitivity analysis As the Groups foreign exchange hedges are fully effective, the Groups profits will be unaffected by any variation in foreign exchange rates and any impact on net equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates is unlikely to be significant.
c Credit risk The UK housing market is structured so that in the majority of cases the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from Registered Social Landlords.
As such, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2008 was 8.6m 2007: 32.0m.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
In addition, the Company is exposed to 2,230.1m of credit risk in relation to inter-company loans, financial guarantees and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings.
Further details are provided in notes 35 and 36.
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways: The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings as set by international credit rating agencies and has a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any counterparty.
The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an ISDA Master Agreement in place.
These agreements permit net settlement thereby reducing the Groups credit exposure to individual counterparties.
d Capital risk management cash flow risk The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group ensures that there are appropriate controls over the purchase of land and levels of work in progress in the business in order to appropriately manage its capital.
These controls are discussed in the business risk table on page 15.
In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the level of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders, issuing new share capital and arranging debt to meet liability payments, and it may also sell non-core assets to reduce debt.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
Defined contribution schemes 2008 2007 m m Contributions during the year Group defined contribution schemes income statement charge 4.9 3.7 At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of 0.2m 2007: 0.4m, which were paid on or before the due date.
Defined benefit scheme The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, which is now closed to new entrants.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 30 November 2007 and updated to 30 June 2008 by a qualified independent actuary.
The projected unit method has been used to calculate the current service cost.
This will rise over time as a percentage of payroll as the members of the scheme approach retirement since the scheme is closed to new members.
The Trustees of the Scheme are currently undertaking their triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes.
Discussions are underway between the Trustees and the Group regarding future contribution requirements.
At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of 0.4m 2007: nil.
The assets of the defined benefit scheme have been calculated at fair value.
The liabilities of the scheme have been calculated at each balance sheet date using the following assumptions: Principal actuarial assumptions 2008 2007 Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations Discount rate 6.30% 5.80% Rate of compensation increase 4.70% 5.30% Rate of price inflation 3.70% 3.30% Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost Discount rate 5.80% 5.25% Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 6.70% 6.19% Rate of compensation increase 5.30% 5.00% Rate of price inflation 3.30% 3.00% Members are assumed to exchange 10% of their pension for cash on retirement.
The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following advice from Mercer Limited, the Groups actuarial advisors.
The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities.
Male Female Retired member life expectancy at age 65 21.3 24.2 Non-retired member life expectancy at age 65 23.1 25.9 The mortality assumptions are based upon the PA92 mortality tables, with allowance for future increases in life expectancy in line with the medium cohort projection.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The actual return on scheme assets was as follows: 2008 2007 m m Actual return on assets Actual return on scheme assets 5.6 16.6 The four-year history of experience adjustments arising on scheme liabilities assets was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2005 Present value of defined benefit obligations m 208.8 232.8 231.8 223.9 Fair value of scheme assets m 171.6 167.9 141.1 115.5 Deficit in the scheme m 37.2 64.9 90.7 108.4 Experience adjustment in scheme liabilities m 11.4 13.2 Percentage of scheme liabilities 5.5% 5.7% Experience adjustment in scheme assets m 17.3 7.6 8.0 Percentage of scheme assets 10.1% 4.5% 5.7% The expected employer contribution to the defined benefit pension scheme in the year ending 30 June 2009 is 15.5m.

Income statement charge A charge to the income statement has been made for the awards issued on or after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005 in accordance with IFRS2 Share-based Payments.
Long-Term Performance Plan The weighted average fair value of the options granted during 2008 was 355p 2007: 788p per award.
The awards have been valued using a Present-Economic Value model for the EPS element of the scheme and a Monte Carlo model for the TSR element of the scheme.
The weighted average inputs to the Present-Economic Value model were as follows: 2008 2007 Grants Grants Average share price 431p 1,095p Average exercise price Expected volatility 30.0% 25.0% Expected life 2.6 years 2.6 years Risk free interest rate Expected dividends 3.0% 3.0% The weighted average inputs to the Monte Carlo model were as follows: 2008 2007 Grants Grants Average share price 431p 1,095p Average exercise price Expected volatility 30.0% 25.0% Expected life 2.6 years 2.6 years Risk free interest rate Expected dividends 3.0% 3.0% Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Groups share price over a period consistent with the expected life of the options.
The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on the Directors best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Total expense The Group recognised an expense of 2.3m 2007: 4.4m in respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions for the year ended 30 June 2008.
