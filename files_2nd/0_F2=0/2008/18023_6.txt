CAPITAL SHOPPING CENTRES PLC DIRECTORS REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2008 REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The new library was handed over to Cardiff Council on schedule in December and John Lewis is currently fitting out its store.
Cardiff will be its largest store outside London.
However, we anticipate the letting market to continue to be challenging in 2009 as retailers approach expansion with caution.
Balance sheet As noted above the groups net assets attributable to equity shareholders were reduced from 1,839 million to 279 million, largely due to the property revaluation deficit in the year of 1,370 million.
Net debt increased by 261 million to 2,736 million at 31 December 2008.
Capital expenditure of 137 million in the year and a dividend payment of 89 million were the most significant factors resulting in the increased net debt in the year.
This higher level of debt was funded through further drawings of existing loan facilities, in particular the loan secured on the Victoria Centre, Nottingham.
Cash Flow The group cash flow shows a net inflow of 35.4 million in 2008 from operating activities.
This is an increase of 52.1 million from 2007 largely due to a favourable movement in working capital balances.
The net outflow from investing activities reflects the net investment in property assets during 2008.
The major components of the 136.8 million expenditure on the purchase and development of property are the expenditure on the groups major developments at Cardiff 80.9 million and Oxford 27.6 million, and 18.1 million on upgrading certain facilities at the MetroCentre.
Financial position The vast majority, over 90 per cent, of the groups debt has been arranged on a non-recourse, asset-specific basis.
This structure permits the group a higher degree of financial flexibility in dealing with individual property issues than a financing structure based on a single group-wide borrowing facility.
In addition to the non-recourse debt, the group had two corporate bonds outstanding at 31 December 2008.
The CSC 2009 bonds of 31.5 million were repaid on 31 March 2009.
The remaining outstanding bonds of 26.7 million are due for repayment in 2013.
Net external debt, which excludes the MetroCentre compound financial instrument of 120.3 million, increased from 2,432 million at 31 December 2007 to 2,616 million at 31 December 2008.
The group had cash of 25 million at 31 December 2008.
At this date the debt to assets ratio was 65 per cent 31 December 2007 47 per cent.
