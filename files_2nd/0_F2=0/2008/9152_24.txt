indd 96 22 4 08 12:39:25 22 4 08 12:39:25 97 King sher Annual Report and Accounts 2007 08 9 Net pension asset liability The Company participates in both a funded fide ned bene t scheme and a funded fide ned contribution scheme.
The total pension charge in the pro t and loss account for the fide ned contribution scheme was 1m 2006 07: nil.
fide ned bene t scheme With reference to the fide ned bene t scheme, the King sher Pension Scheme, King sher plc is one of a member of Group companies that participates in the scheme, and therefore the Company has accounted for its share of the scheme assets and liabilities.
The valuation of the scheme used for FRS 17 has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2007 and has been updated to 2 February 2008.
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the fide ned bene t pension plan, as shown in the tables below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally quali ed actuaries.
The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time.
Movements in the financial assumptions can lead to signi cant movement in the estimated obligations of the plan.
The discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index.
The overall expected rate of return on plan assets re ects market expectations at the valuation date of long-term asset returns and the mix of assets in the plan.
Annual % rate 2007 08 2006 07 Discount rate 6.2 5.3 Salary escalation 4.1 4.5 Rate of pension increases 3.3 2.9 Price in ation 3.3 2.9 % rate of return 2007 08 2006 07 Equities 8.1 7.8 Bonds 5.3 4.9 Property 6.7 6.3 Other 4.3 3.9 Overall expected rate of return 6.8 6.5 The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the fide ned bene t pension liabilities have been selected with regard to the characteristics and experience of the membership of the plan from 2004 to 2007.
The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables PA 92 tables projected forward to 2007 with the medium cohort improvement factors for males and with the standard improvement factors for females.
In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy.
For males, the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 1% pa, and for females, the allowance is in line with the standard improvements, subject to a minimum of 0.5% pa.
These improvements have been set with regard to trends observed within the plan over the past decade.
The corresponding assumptions for life expectancy of pension plan members are as follows: 2007 08 2006 07 Age to which current pensioners are expected to live 60 now Male 87.2 85.1 Female 85.9 86.3 Age to which future pensioners are expected to live 60 in 15 years time Male 88.8 86.2 Female 87.1 87.5 The main financial assumption is the real discount rate, representing the excess of the discount rate over the rate of in ation.
If this assumption increased decreased by 0.1%, the fide ned bene t obligation would decrease increase by approximately 1m.

The last grant of options under the Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share Option schemes was made in April 2003.
Under these schemes, participants received a bi-annual grant of options based on their position in the Group.
These options are normally exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the grant up to the tenth anniversary, except where the performance condition has not been met, in which case this date is deferred accordingly.
The performance conditions for all options have now been met, except for the grant made in April 2003.
On the exercise of Phantom Share Options, participants receive in cash the increase in value of the allocated number of notional shares in the Company.
All permanent employees excluding those receiving Executive Options were each granted options over 529 shares in both 1997 and 1998, provided that they were employed as at 19 March 1997 and in employment on the date of grant.
These options were granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme.
Group employees, including directors, are granted contingent share awards under the King sher Incentive Share Scheme as part of their annual performance award.
In the prior year the Group made its first contingent share awards under the Performance Share Plan and the King sher Retention Plan.
Under the UK ShareSave Scheme, eligible UK employees have been invited to enter into Inland Revenue approved savings contracts for a period of three or five years, whereby shares may be acquired with repayments under the contract.
The option price is the average market price over three days shortly before an offer to subscribe, discounted by 20%.
Options are exercisable within a six month period from the conclusion of a three or five year period.
The International ShareSave Plan, which operates along the lines of the UK ShareSave Scheme, includes eligible employees in certain overseas locations.
There are 7,375 employees in Group ShareSave Schemes, of which 111 are in the International Plan at 2 February 2008.
The rules of all schemes include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances.
The Company has not repeated the disclosures required by FRS 20 as these are already included in note 31 of the King sher plc consolidated financial statements.
The Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP The ESOP has been funded by a 114m interest free loan from the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to acquire shares in King sher plc.
