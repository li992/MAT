The special reserve may be used as distributable profits for all purposes and in particular the acquisition by the Company of its ordinary shares.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has issued guidance TECH 01 08 stating that profits arising out of a change in fair value of assets, recognised in accordance with accounting standards, may be distributed, provided the relevant assets can be readily converted into cash.
Securities listed on a recognised stock exchange are generally regarded as being convertible into cash and hence any unrealised profits net of losses included within Capital reserves may be regarded as realised and so are distributable.
For the current year there was a net loss of 43,865,000 which is not distributable 2007: profit of 772,757,000 which was distributable.
However, under the terms of the Companys Articles of Association, sums within Capital reserves are available for distribution only by way of redemption or purchase of the Companys own shares.
In addition, in order to maintain investment trust status, the Company may only distribute accumulated realised profits if it is able to do so.
