Prior year restatement Further to the change in accounting policy explained in Note 2, the impact on the prior year balance sheet is that Investments in Group undertakings have increased by 18.6m reflecting shares issued or acquired in respect of the share entitlements of subsidiary employees.
Trade and other receivables: Amounts due from subsidiary undertakings have decreased by 12.9m to the extent such shares have vested.
The share scheme reserve has increased by 5.3m reflecting the shares held which have not vested.
Trade and other payables: Accruals and deferred income have increased by 0.7m and retained earnings have decreased by 0.3m, to correct the remaining differences compared to prior year treatment.
There is no impact on the prior year profit and loss account.
Contingent liabilities The Company is co-guarantor of the Groups bank loan and overdraft facilities.
Related party transactions The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 8 available to a parent company not to disclose transactions with other Group companies within its financial statements.
Post balance sheet event The Directors became aware on 12 November 2008 that, unless the borrowing powers in the Articles of Association of the Company were appropriately amended within a three month period, the Group would not be in compliance with the borrowing powers therein.
In the opinion of the Directors it is highly probable that a Special Resolution will be passed at the next AGM such that there is no impact on the Groups financial position.
