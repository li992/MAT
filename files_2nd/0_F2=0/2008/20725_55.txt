42472 Financial:42472 Financial 21 4 08 10:39 Page 84 84 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was approved by the Company's shareholders at its Annual General Meeting on 24 May 2007 and replaces the SMEIP.
Like the SMEIP, it is a discretionary plan for executive directors and senior managers.
The LTIP comprises two elements: firstly it provides for the grant of matching awards based on the proportion of annual bonus applied by participants in the purchase of shares in the Company and held by the EBT: and secondly it provides for the grant of performance awards.
Both awards, granted over shares in the Company, vest either in full or in part at the end of the three year performance period subject to the TSR meeting pre-defined targets.
In the year to 31 January 2008 participating employees applied a proportion of their annual cash bonuses for the year ended 31 January 2007 to purchase 103,711 67,700 Company shares at a price of 3.8625 3.78 per share.
Matching awards of up to 197,928 140,360 shares, and performance awards of up to 1,015,637 nil were granted.
Matching awards and performance awards made during the year were valued at 266,807 290,703 and 1,233,659 nil respectively.
The fair value of the awards granted during the period was calculated using a binomial methodology.
The assumptions used were a share price of 3.8625, share price volatility of 12.3% based on 3 year volatility to 1 February 2007, dividend yield of 2.03%, risk free interest rate of 5%, growth in RPI of 3% per annum, and forfeiture of nil.
In addition to the foregoing plans, matching awards of 434,338 shares were granted based on her investment in Alliance Trust shares to Katherine Garrett-Cox in connection with her appointment as Chief Investment Officer of the Company.
Those awards were made at the same time as, and otherwise on the same terms to, matching awards granted under the LTIP.
The awards were valued at 585,488 based on the assumptions referred to in the foregoing paragraph.
The cumulative charge to the income statement during the year for the cost of the SMEIP and LTIP awards referred to above was 613,748 142,541 for the Company and 885,242 203,614 for the Group.
Per IFRS 2 the costs of matching awards for each plan are expensed over the three year performance period.
