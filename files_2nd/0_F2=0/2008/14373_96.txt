SHARE CAPITAL The principal trading market for the Ordinary Shares is the London Stock Exchange.
The Ordinary Shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange on 16 November 1999, trading in the form of ADSs evidenced by ADRs.
The number of ordinary shares represented by each ADS is five.
The ADR facility is sponsored by The Bank of  depositary.
All the Ordinary Shares, including those held by directors and officers, rank pari passu with each other.
Following approval by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting in December 2005, on 23 January 2006, the 2 Ordinary Shares of 12 9 pence were redenominated as Ordinary Shares of US 20.
The new US Dollar Ordinary Shares carry the same rights as the previous Ordinary Shares.
The shares continue to be traded on the London Stock Exchange and quoted in Sterling.
The ADSs continued to represent five Ordinary Shares.
In order to comply with English law the Company has issued 50,000 of shares in Sterling.
These were issued as Deferred Shares, which are not listed on any stock exchange and have extremely limited rights and therefore effectively have no value.
These were allotted to the Chief Executive, though the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another .
Shareholdings As at 11 March 2009, 8,404,235 ADSs equivalent to 42,021,175 Ordinary Shares or approximately 4.8% of the total OrdinaryShares inissue,  holders.
As at 11 March 2009, to the knowledge of the Group, there were 22,787 registered holders of Ordinary Shares, of whom 90 had registered addresses in the US and held a total of 229,544 Ordinary Shares less than 1% of the total issued.
Because certain Ordinary Shares are registered in the names of nominees, the number of shareholders with registered addresses in the US is not representative of the number of beneficial owners of OrdinaryShares resident intheUS.
