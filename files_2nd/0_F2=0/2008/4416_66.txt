Notes to the Company financial statements for the period ended 30 April 2008 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial information set out on pages 102 to 107 comprises the financial statements of Kesa Electricals plc for the 15 months ended 30 April 2008 prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
The financial statements of the Company are prepared under United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain items as set out in the accounting policies below, and are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Investments In the Company balance sheet, investments in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost adjusted for capital contributions relating to share-based payments.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are included in the balance sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is charged to reflect a reduction from book value to estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset to the Company.
Tangible fixed assets comprise fixtures, fittings and equipment.
These are depreciated over their estimated useful economic life of five years on a straight-line basis.
Employee share schemes The cost of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares are recognised over the period of the employees related performance.
Where there are no performance criteria, the cost is recognised when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares.
The cost of awards is measured as the fair value of the award at grant date less employee contributions.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any financial incentives received from the lessor are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or period to break clause.
Charges made in respect of operating leases of property are adjusted from time to time to reflect the impact of market rent reviews throughout the life of the lease.
Retirement benefits In accordance with FRS 17, the Company accounts for its contributions to the Comet Pension Scheme on a defined contribution scheme basis.
This is because the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme cover the Company and a number of its subsidiaries and cannot be split between each subsidiary on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The Company has therefore taken advantage of the multi-employer exemption allowed by paragraph 9 b of FRS 17.
The pension rights of the Company are dealt with through a self-administered scheme, the assets of which are held independently of the Companys finances.
The scheme is a defined benefit scheme that is funded partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from the Company and its subsidiaries at rates advised by independent professional qualified actuaries.
Disclosure relating to the Comet Pension Scheme is included in note 37 to the consolidated financial statements.
