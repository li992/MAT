68 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 March 2008 1.
Accounting policies WS Atkins plc is a public limited company registered and domiciled in the UK.
Its registered office is Woodcote Grove, Ashley Road, Epsom, Surrey KT18 5BW, England.
Basis of preparation The consolidated Financial Statements of WS Atkins plc have been prepared in accordance with EU-adopted International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the valuation of pensions, share-based payments and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Material estimates applied across the Groups businesses and Joint Ventures are reviewed to a common standard and adjusted where appropriate to ensure that consistent treatment of similar and related issues that require judgement is achieved upon consolidation.
Any revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated Financial Statements, are disclosed on page 36 of the Operating and Financial Review.
The Group has adopted IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and has included additional disclosures and detail for the current and comparative period.
The Group and Company has adopted IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
The adoption of this IFRIC had no effect on the Group.
Basis of consolidation The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented including the application of new IFRS standards and interpretations.
The Consolidated Income Statement and balance sheet include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and its share of Joint Ventures.
The results of the subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the year are included in the income statement up to the date of disposal.
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Where subsidiaries adopt accounting policies that are different from the Group, their reported results are restated to comply with the Groups accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Where subsidiaries do not adopt accounting periods that are coterminous with the Groups, results and net assets are based upon accounts drawn up to the Groups accounting reference date based on unaudited accounts.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.
The accounts of the Employee Benefit Trusts EBTs are incorporated into the results of the Group as, although they are administered by independent Trustees and their assets are held separately from those of the Group, in practice the Groups advice on how the assets are used for the benefit of employees is normally accepted.
The Group bears the major risks and rewards of the assets held by the EBTs until the shares vest unconditionally with the employees.
Shares in WS Atkins plc held by the EBTs are shown as a reduction in retained loss earnings.
Other assets and liabilities held by the EBTs are consolidated with the assets of the Group.
Foreign currency transactions and translation Functional and presentation currency Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys and Groups functional and presentation currency.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2008 Introduction Reviews Governance Financial Statements Investor Information Financial Statements 69 Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
Group companies Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the closing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Trading results of overseas subsidiaries are translated at average rates of exchange.
Differences resulting from the retranslation of opening net assets and results for the period at closing rates are taken to the statement of recognised income and expense.
Segment reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
The Group is organised into six operating segments for management purposes, reflecting its key markets and service offerings.
The segments are Design and Engineering Solutions: Highways and Transportation: Rail: Middle East, China and Europe: Management and Project Services: and Asset Management.
The continuing elements of the former Equity Investment segment are now shown within Asset Management.
These segments form the basis for reporting the Groups primary segment information as it is the main determinant of the Groups risks and returns.
The basis for reporting the secondary segment information is the geographical sectors of the United Kingdom, other European countries, Middle East, North America and Asia Pacific.
These represent the Groups most significant geographical sectors.
The majority of central costs are allocated to segments based on revenue or utilisation of resource.
All revenue relates to revenue from services.
Inter-segment transfers and transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties.
Revenue Revenue from long-term contracts comprises the value of work performed during the period calculated in accordance with the Groups policy for contract accounting set out below.
Revenue from other contract activities represents fee income receivable in respect of services provided during the period.
Under certain services contracts, the Group manages customer expenditure and is obliged to purchase goods and services from thirdparty contractors and recharge them on to the customer at cost.
The amounts charged by contractors and recharged to customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales where the Group is acting as an agent.
Receivables, payables and cash relating to these transactions are included in the Group balance sheet.
Revenue recognition and contract accounting The value of contract work in progress comprises the costs incurred on contracts plus an appropriate proportion of overheads and attributable profit.
Fees invoiced on account are deducted from the value of work in progress and the balance is separately disclosed in trade and other receivables as amounts recoverable on contracts, unless such fees exceed the value of the work in progress on any contract when the excess is separately disclosed in trade and other payables as fees invoiced in advance.
Profit is recognised on a percentage completion basis when the outcome of a contract or project can be reasonably foreseen.
Provision is made in full for estimated losses.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be reasonably foreseen, profit is taken on completion.
Where contracts span two or more accounting periods, profit is not generally recognised until the contract is 50% complete.
Revenue recognition on outsourcing contracts is determined by reference to the proportion of the annual service delivered to date.
Where the costs of obligations in relation to the non-renewal or termination of a contract are higher in the final period of the contract a proportion of revenue is deferred each period to meet these anticipated costs.
Full provision is made for losses on outsourcing contracts if the forecast costs of fulfilling the contract throughout the contract period exceed the forecast income receivable.
In assessing the amount of the loss to provide on an outsourcing contract, account is taken of the Groups share of the forecast results from any Joint Ventures which the contract is servicing.
Interest income is recognised on a time-apportionment basis using the effective interest method.
When a receivable is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income.
Interest income on impaired loans is recognised using the original effective interest rate.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2008 70 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Continued Pre-contract costs The Group accounts for all pre-contract costs in accordance with IAS 11, Construction contracts.
Costs incurred before it becomes probable that a contract will be obtained are charged to expenses.
Directly attributable costs incurred after that point are recognised in the balance sheet and charged to the income statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP PFI concessions, over the same period as the Groups interest in any Special Purpose Company SPC charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the income statement.
Bid recovery fees are deferred and credited to the income statement over the duration of the contract or, in the case of PPP PFI concessions, over the same period as the Groups interest in any SPC charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the income statement.
Where the Groups interest in any SPC reduces, the deferred bid recovery fees are credited to the income statement in proportion to the reduction of the Groups interest.
Exceptional items Where certain expense or revenue items recorded in a period are material by their size or incidence, the Group reflects such items as exceptional items and these are shown separately in the income statement.
Exceptional items are also summarised by class in the segmental analyses, excluding those that relate to interest and tax.
Retirement benefit schemes The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes which require payments to be made into separately administered funds.
For defined benefit schemes, regular valuations are prepared by independent professionally qualified actuaries to determine the level of contributions required to fund the benefits set out in the scheme rules.
The Group accounts for pensions in accordance with IAS 19, Employee benefits.
The cost of the defined contribution schemes is charged to operating profit as incurred.
The cost of the defined benefit schemes is charged as follows: the current service cost incurred during the period to provide retirement benefits to employees is charged to operating profit: gains or losses arising from settlements or curtailments not covered by actuarial assumptions are included in operating profit: a charge representing the expected increase in scheme liabilities is included in net finance costs.
This is based on the present value of scheme liabilities at the beginning of the period: and a credit representing the expected return on scheme assets is included within net finance costs.
This is based on the market value of the assets of the schemes at the start of the period allowing for expected cash flows during the period.
For defined benefit schemes, differences between actual and expected returns on assets during the period are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense, together with differences arising from changes in assumptions.
The difference between the market value of scheme assets and the present value of scheme liabilities is recognised as a retirement benefit asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet.
To the extent that it is recoverable, any related deferred tax asset or liability is included in the relevant category of receivable payable.
The Group has elected to recognise actuarial gains and losses in full as they arise through retained loss earnings.
Share-based payments In accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payments, the cost of share-based payments awarded after 7 November 2002 is charged to the income statement over the performance and vesting periods of the instruments.
The cost is based on the fair value of the awards made at the date of grant adjusted for the number of awards expected to vest.
In accordance with the transitional provisions within IFRS 2, no charge is made in respect of instruments awarded before 7 November 2002.
The credits associated with the amounts charged to the income statement are included in retained earnings loss until the awards are exercised.
Where awards are settled by new issue shares any proceeds received in respect of share options are credited to share capital and share premium.
Where awards are settled in shares held by the EBTs any proceeds are credited to retained earnings loss.
Share awards are granted by the Parent Company to employees of its subsidiaries.
The Company charges to cost of investment in subsidiaries an amount equivalent to the annual IFRS 2 charge, with an equivalent credit to reserves in accordance with IFRIC 11, Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
Joint Ventures In accordance with IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures, the Group accounts for Joint Ventures under the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of a Joint Ventures profit after tax is included from the date on which the Group acquires joint control.
Within the consolidated balance sheet the investment is recorded at cost classified as a non-current asset and subsequently adjusted to reflect the Groups share of the movements in the Joint Ventures net assets post-acquisition.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2008 Introduction Reviews Governance Financial Statements Investor Information Financial Statements 71 The results, assets and liabilities of Joint Ventures are stated in accordance with Group accounting policies.
Where Joint Ventures adopt accounting policies that are different from the Group, their reported results are restated to comply with the Groups accounting policies.
Where Joint Ventures do not adopt accounting periods that are coterminous with the Groups, results and net assets are based upon unaudited accounts drawn up to the Groups accounting reference date.
PPP PFI concessions Assets constructed by PPP PFI concession companies are classified in the accounts of the Joint Ventures as financial assets or intangible assets, depending on whether the grantor or user has the primary responsibility to pay the operator for the concession services.
To date all of the Groups PPP PFI concession assets have been classed as financial assets.
The financial asset represents an interest-bearing, long-term receivable.
The cost of the financial asset at any one time is equal to the accumulated value of service delivery plus accumulated interest charged to the financial asset less amounts received to date.
The financial asset is measured at fair value.
Where it is classed as a loan receivable any movement in fair value is taken to the income statement.
Where it is classed as available for sale any movement in fair value is taken to reserves.
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received for goods and services provided in the normal course of business net of value added tax rebates and discounts.
Revenue from contracting activities represents the value of work carried out during the year including amounts not invoiced.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying value amount.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be measured reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date as measured by the contract costs incurred.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that contract costs incurred will be recovered.
When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected resultant loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Income tax Current and deferred income tax are recognised in the income statement for the period except where the taxation arises as a result of a transaction or event that is recognised directly in equity.
Income tax arising on transactions or events recognised directly in equity is charged or credited directly to equity.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated Financial Statements.
However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and Joint Ventures.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment.
Prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill was amortised over its estimated useful economic life.
Amortisation ceased on 1 April 2004 and the carrying value of existing goodwill was frozen at that date and subject to annual impairment review.
On acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of the net assets.
In accordance with IFRS 3, Business combinations, goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to impairment review both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill that arose prior to 1 April 1997 was written off to retained earnings loss.
Profit or loss on disposal of the underlying businesses to which this goodwill related will not include goodwill previously recorded as a deduction from equity.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2008 72 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Continued Acquired customer relationships Acquired customer relationships consist of intangible assets arising on the consolidation of recently acquired business, principally future order books, that do not appear within the balance sheet of the acquired entity itself, and which are separable from goodwill in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations and IAS 38, Intangible Assets.
Customer relationships are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of between one and three years.
Corporate information systems In accordance with IAS 38, Intangible assets, the Groups corporate information systems are treated as an intangible asset.
Costs included are those directly attributable to the design, construction and testing of new systems including major enhancements and internally generated costs from the point of inception to the point of satisfactory completion where the probable future economic benefits arising from the investment could be assessed with reasonable certainty at the time the costs are incurred.
Maintenance and minor modifications are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
The corporate information systems are amortised on a straightline basis over their estimated useful economic life of six years.
Software licences Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of between two and five years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Cost comprises purchase price after discounts and rebates plus all directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use.
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis calculated at annual rates to write off the cost less residual value of each asset over the term of its estimated useful economic life as follows: Freehold buildings 10 to 50 years Short leasehold over the life of the lease Plant and machinery 3 to 10 years Special purpose industrial motor vehicles 3 to 12 years Other motor vehicles 3 to 4 years 1 Information technology 2 2 to 5 years No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold land.
The directors annually review the estimated useful economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment.
Impairment Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairments.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets into the following two categories: at fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss These include fixed interest securities, floating rate notes and certificates of deposit which are valued at bid price quoted on a recognised stock exchange.
Debt securities issued at a significant discount to the maturity value are valued at cost plus amortised discount over the life of the security.
Also included are restricted cash deposits where withdrawals are restricted under contractual arrangements.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included within current assets except where the maturity is greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date in which case they are included as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables consist of trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents, which are shown separately within the balance sheet.
Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount less provision for impairment, which, due to their short-term nature, approximates to their fair value.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2008 Introduction Reviews Governance Financial Statements Investor Information Financial Statements 73 Other receivables include loan notes receivable in respect of disposals, which are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any provision for impairment.
This valuation approximates to their fair value.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement.
Impairment testing for trade receivables is described below in the accounting policy paragraph relating to trade receivables.
Inventories Inventories are stated at cost less impairment.
Cost is calculated on a first-in, first-out basis.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
Where a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is assessed as being effective in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the gain or loss on re-measurement is recognised in the income statement together with the corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Where a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and is assessed as being effective in accordance with IAS 39, the gain or loss on re-measurement is recognised in equity.
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement when the underlying transaction being hedged occurs or, if the transaction results in the creation of a non-financial asset or liability, are included in the initial cost of the asset or liability.
Where the derivative is designated as a hedge in the net investment in a foreign operation and is assessed as being effective in accordance with IAS 39, the gain or loss on re-measurement is recognised in equity.
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation.
Similar treatment is applied where the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is a non-derivative financial instrument such as a foreign currency loan.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Lease obligations Finance leases Lease arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee are treated as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the asset.
A liability is recognised for the present value of the minimum lease payments within current and or non-current liabilities as appropriate.
Rental payments are apportioned between capital and interest expense to achieve a constant rate of interest charge on the outstanding obligation.
Where the Group acts as a lessor in a finance lease, receivables under finance leases represent outstanding amounts due under these agreements less finance charges allocated to future periods.
Finance lease interest is recognised over the primary period of the lease so as to produce a constant rate of return on the net cash investment.
Operating leases Where the Group acts as lessee in an operating lease arrangement, the lease payments are charged as an expense to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives received are also recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Where the Group acts as lessor in an operating lease arrangement, rental income from operating leases is accounted for on a straightline basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives provided are also recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised at original invoice amount.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2008 74 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Continued Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Provisions for other liabilities and charges Onerous contract provisions are recognised for losses on contracts where the forecast costs of fulfilling the contract throughout the contract period exceed the forecast income receivable.
In assessing the amount of the loss to provide on any contract, account is taken of the Groups share of the forecast results from any Joint Ventures which the contract is servicing.
The provision is calculated based on discounted cash flows to the end of the contract.
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the Group has committed to a course of action that will result in the property becoming vacant.
The provision is calculated based on discounted cash flows to the end of the lease.
Application of new IFRS standards and interpretations a Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in current financial year but not relevant The following standards, amendments and interpretations are effective in the current year but are not relevant to the Groups activities: IFRS 4, Insurance contracts: IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyper-inflationary economies: IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2: IFRIC 9, Re-assessment of embedded derivatives: and IFRIC 10, Interim financial reporting and impairment.
b Standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group IFRS 2, Share-based payments clarification of share vesting conditions effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, is not expected to have any significant impact on the results of the Group: IFRS 3 revised, Business combinations effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, will impact the calculation of consideration and goodwill for future acquisitions, as transaction costs will be expensed and some contingent payments will be re-measured at fair value through the income statement.
If this was early adopted, 0.7m of goodwill currently capitalised would have been expensed through the income statement in the period: IFRS 8, Operating segments effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 replaces IAS 14 and aligns segment reporting with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.
The new standard uses a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
The Group will apply IFRS 8 from 1 April 2009 but it is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups accounts: IAS 1 revised, Presentation of Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, is not expected to have any significant impact on the results of the Group: IAS 23, Borrowing costs effective from 1 January 2009.
The amendment to the standard is still subject to endorsement by the EU.
It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of that asset.
The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed.
The group will apply IAS 23 Amended from 1 April 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU but is currently not applicable to the Group or Company as there are no qualifying assets: IAS 27 revised, Consolidated and separate Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, is not expected to have any significant impact on the results of the Group: and IAS 32, Financial instruments and IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, effective from 1 January 2009.
The amendment requires entities to classify certain types of financial instruments as equity, provided they have particular features and meet specific specified conditions.
The Group will apply these amendments from 1 January 2009 but it is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups accounts.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2008 Introduction Reviews Governance Financial Statements Investor Information Financial Statements 75 c Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for later accounting periods and the Group has not early adopted: IFRIC 14, IAS 19, The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008.
IFRIC 14 provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised as an asset.
It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding requirement.
The Group will apply IFRIC 14 from 1 April 2008, but it is not expected to have any impact on the Groups or Companys accounts based on current IAS 19 assumptions.
d Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and not relevant for the Groups operations The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for later accounting periods but are not relevant for the Groups operations: IFRIC 13, Customer loyalty programmes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008.
IFRIC 13 clarifies that where goods or services are sold together with a customer loyalty incentive for example, loyalty points or free products, the arrangement is a multiple-element arrangement and the consideration receivable from the customer is allocated between the components of the arrangement using fair values.
IFRIC 13 is not relevant to the Group or Companys operations because none of the Groups companies operate any loyalty programmes.
e Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and the principles have been applied by the Group The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for later accounting periods and the Group has applied the principles early: IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements which outlines an approach to account for contractual arrangements arising from entities providing public services.
Financial risk management Risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
These policies are further described within the Treasury Policies and Objectives section of the Operating and Financial Review.
Where individual sensitivities are disclosed below, all other variables are held constant.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The Group operates in a number of international territories.
Each business undertakes a large proportion of its commercial transactions within its local market and in its local functional currency.
Foreign exchange risk arises from the small proportion of commercial transactions undertaken in currencies other than the local functional currency, from financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency and on the Groups net investments in foreign operations.
Group policy is for each business to undertake commercial transactions in its own functional currency whenever possible.
When this is not possible, the Group manages its foreign exchange risk from future commercial transactions using appropriate derivative contracts arranged via Group Treasury.
Cash flows are reviewed on a monthly basis throughout the duration of future projects and the future cover amended as appropriate.
Trade receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency arise from commercial transactions and are therefore largely hedged as part of the process described above.
Remaining financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency include bank accounts, loans and intercompany funding balances.
These are unhedged with the exception of balances that are themselves designated as hedging instruments used to hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2008 76 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Continued The Groups primary exposure to foreign exchange rate risk on unhedged financial instruments arises mainly in respect of movements between the US dollar including dollar-pegged currencies and sterling and between the euro and sterling.
At 31 March 2008, if sterling had strengthened weakened by 9% against the US dollar then profit after tax would be lower higher by approximately 0.3m 2007: 0.2m and equity would be 0.3m lower higher 2007: 0.2m.
If sterling had strengthened weakened by 20% against the euro then profit after tax would be lower higher by approximately 1.3m 2007: 0.4m and equity would be 1.3m lower higher 2007: 0.4m.
The Groups investments in foreign operations are subject to foreign currency translation risk.
A proportion of this risk has been managed by taking out foreign currency loans in the relevant currency and, in one instance, by maintaining a substantial sterling bank account balance in the local business.
Following a review of hedging policy undertaken during the year, it was decided not to hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations and as a consequence the foreign currency loans were repaid.
ii Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate risk arises from loan notes, cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss which are all interest bearing, offset in part by interest bearing borrowings.
The majority of items included in the above are at floating rates of interest or fixed deposits for periods of less than six months: changes in the interest rate result in changes in interest related cash flow.
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the Group or its subsidiaries.
If interest rates for the year to 31 March 2008 were 10 basis points higher lower, then profit after tax for the year would have been approximately 0.1m 2007: 0.1m higher lower, principally due to increased interest received on short-term bank deposits.
iii Price risk The Group does not have any equity securities in its balance sheet and is not materially exposed to commodity price risk.
Certain longer term project and framework contracts include indexation clauses that are applied to unit rates to offset the effect of inflation on input costs over the duration of the agreement.
The Group is exposed to price risk to the extent that inflation differs from the index used and forecast project outcomes that form the basis of revenue recognition include an estimate of this risk where it is present.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the Group will suffer financial loss as a result of counterparties defaulting on their contractual obligations.
The risk arises on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables, with the maximum exposure to risk equivalent to 100% of the carrying value disclosed in the Groups balance sheet at 31 March.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The majority of the Groups cash deposits are placed with its relationship banks, which carry at least an AA credit rating.
For deposits and money-market investments placed with banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
Investments carry a minimum credit rating of A1 P1.
Cash and investments are not concentrated with any one counterparty.
For trade and other receivables, an assessment of credit quality of the customer is made where appropriate using a combination of external rating agencies, past experience and other factors.
In circumstances where credit information is unavailable or poor, the risk is mitigated by use of advance payments and, by exception, through credit risk insurance.
Group policy is not to apply individual credit limits, although exposure and payment performance are monitored closely both at individual project and client level, with a series of escalating debt recovery actions taken where necessary.
The Groups customer base is broad and dispersed: there are no concentrations of credit risk that would cause concern.
c Liquidity risk The Group funds its activities through cash generated from its operations and, where necessary, bank borrowings and finance leases.
The Groups banking facilities include cash facilities and bank guarantees.
Cash flow forecasts are prepared covering various periods from short to long-term to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet the Groups commitments as they fall due.
The table below analyses the maturity profile of the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities.

Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to minimise its cost of capital by maintaining an optimal capital structure.
The Group maintains or adjusts its capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders, issues of new shares and buy-back of existing shares and through its loan facility.
For capital management purposes, the Group monitors the ratio of its net debt plus defined benefit pension deficit net of deferred tax to EBITDA.
This policy is unchanged from prior year.

Earnings per share EPS Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year excluding shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts EBTs which have not unconditionally vested in the employees and shares in treasury.
Diluted earnings per share is the basic earnings per share after allowing for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the number of options outstanding during the year.
The options relate to discretionary employee share plans.

Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to their business segment.
The goodwill allocation by CGU, summarised at segmental level, is disclosed in note 3.
The recoverable amount of goodwill for each CGU has been based on value in use as represented by the net present value of future cash flows.
Cash flows are projected forward for five years based on approved budgets and plans, beyond which they are inflated by a GDP-based growth factor.
They are then discounted using a discount rate based on the Groups pre-tax discount rate based on nominal weighted average cost of capital.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 12.5% per annum.
The key assumptions used for each CGU are as follows: Group 2008 2007 m m 5-year growth rate 8% 15% 9% 17% Post-5-year growth rate 4% 4% Taxation rate 12.5% 40% 12.5% 40% As at 31 March 2008, based on these internal valuations, the recoverable value of goodwill required no impairment.

These include new customers and synergy benefits.
The provisional fair value adjustments relate primarily to the alignment to Group accounting policies.
The initial accounting for these acquisitions has been determined provisionally because fair values have not been finalised.
Any adjustments to the accounting required following finalisation of the fair values to be assigned to the acquired assets and liabilities will be recorded from the acquisition date within 12 months of the acquisition date.
During the year the Group paid additional cash consideration of 0.6m to the vendors of Advantage Business Group acquired on 19 March 2007 and incurred and capitalised direct expenses of 0.4m.
During the year the Group paid additional cash consideration of 0.4m to the vendors of Boreas Consultants Limited acquired on 14 December 2006 and incurred and capitalised direct expenses of 0.1m.
As a result of finalising fair values of previous acquisitions and incurring qualifying direct expenses, additional goodwill of 0.9m, 0.3m and 0.4m was recognised for Boreas Consultants Limited, Advantage Business Group and Mantix Group Limited respectively during the year.
Included in the Groups results for the year is 1.7m of revenue, 0.3m profit before taxation and 0.2m profit after taxation in relation to the acquisitions above.
If the acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the year then the Groups results would have included 4.9m revenue, 1.4m profit before taxation and 0.9m profit after taxation for the year in relation to the acquisitions.
The Groups total results would have been 1,316.8m of revenue, 93.0m profit before taxation and 69.3m profit after taxation.

Retirement benefit liabilities The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The two main defined benefit schemes are the Atkins Pension Plan and the Railways Pension Scheme, both of which are funded final salary schemes.
The assets of both schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Other pension schemes include the Atkins McCarthy Pension Plan in the Republic of Ireland, which is a final salary funded defined benefit scheme, and a range of defined contribution schemes or equivalent.
At 30 September 2007 the defined benefit section of the Atkins Pension Plan was closed to future accrual of benefit for members who do not enjoy a statutory or contractual right to a final-salary pension.
These members have transferred to a defined contribution section of the plan with effect from 1 October 2007.
The defined benefit sections of all pension schemes are closed to new entrants, who are now offered membership of the defined contribution section.

Share-based payments Long Term Incentive Plans Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP September 2006 onwards A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash.
There are different performance targets for different categories of management.
Awards made to executive directors and senior employees have 50% of the award subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts on the date of the award.
Full vesting of this portion of the award will take place if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile, 30% vesting will be achieved with a median ranking with pro rata vesting for intermediate performance.
No vesting will occur for a ranking below median.
The remaining 50% of the award made to executive directors and senior employees is subject to the Companys real growth in normalised earnings per share EPS over the performance period.
For the 2006 and subsequent awards the growth target required the increase to be more than 10% per annum above the UK Retail Price Index RPI in the three-year performance period to allow full vesting: if the increase is less than 4% per annum above the UK RPI then there will be no vesting.
A sliding scale operates between 4% and 10% above the UK RPI.
Awards made to other participants are subject solely to the EPS condition.
As a general rule awards made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will lapse.
In the event that a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they receive a pro-rated entitlement.
Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following award, without interest.
Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP September 2003 to August 2006 A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash.
The performance condition is TSR with an EPS growth underpin measured over three financial years starting with the financial year beginning immediately after the award is granted.
Full vesting of any award will take place for a top 20% ranking against a group of up to 16 comparator companies, 30% vesting for a median ranking and no award if TSR falls below the median.
The EPS underpin is the UK RPI plus 2% per annum.
Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP pre-September 2003 A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees that are settled in equity.
Awards have an EPS performance condition.
EPS is required to be more than 12% per annum above the UK RPI in the relevant three-year performance period to enable all of the ordinary shares to be acquired, but if the EPS growth is less than 5% per annum above the UK RPI then none of the ordinary shares can be acquired.
A sliding scale in relation to the number of ordinary shares that can be acquired operates for growth in EPS between 5% and 12% above the UK RPI.
Participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared, without interest, on the shares subject to the award between vesting and exercise.
All awards have now vested.

The right to the matching ordinary shares is subject to a performance condition identical to those in the Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan pre September 2003.
Participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following award, without interest, on the shares subject to the Bonus Award after exercise and the benefit of dividends declared, without interest, on the shares subject to the Matching Award between vesting and exercise.

For the purposes of valuing LTIP awards with market performance conditions, the Monte Carlo model has been used to arrive at the share-based payments charge.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: LTIP LTIP 2008 2007 Exercise price nil nil Risk-free interest rate n a n a Discount in respect of dividend yield 0% 0% Volatility of share price 22.6% 22.3% to 24.4% Share price at grant date 11.09.2006 837.0p 03.08.2007 1,035.0p Option life 3 to 9 years 3 to 10 years Expected exercise behaviour options 100% in year 4 100% in year 4 allocations 100% year 4 100% year 4 Volatility was determined based on the movement in the share price over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to the period over which the TSR condition applies, which equates to a three-year share price history 2007 a three-year share price history.
The fair value of share plans involving market performance conditions takes into account market information.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, the Monte Carlo model simulates TSR for the Company and a comparator group.
In 2008 and 2007 the comparator group consisted of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
The model takes into account historic dividends and share price volatilities for the Company and the comparator group to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
Awards that do not contain market performance conditions are valued at market value at date of award and discounted in the event that the award does not benefit from dividends during the vesting period.
