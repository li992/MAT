Intangible assets: goodwill m Carrying amount At January 2008, January 2007 and January 2006 36.2 Goodwill relates entirely to Next Sourcing and is tested for impairment at the balance sheet date.
The recoverable amount of goodwill at 26 January 2008 and 27 January 2007 was measured on the basis of value in use.
As this exceeded carrying value, no impairment loss was recognised 2007: nil.
The key assumptions in the calculation are the future sourcing requirements of the Group and the ability of Next Sourcing to efficiently meet these requirements based on past experience.
In assessing value in use, the most recent financial results and internal budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four 2007: four further years with no subsequent growth assumed, and discounted at 6.0% 2007: 6.5%.
In the year ended January 2008, Next Sourcing generated an operating profit before interest of 32.8m 2007: 31.8m.

The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to the historical default rate for the preceding 365 days of 1.7% 2007: 3.4%.
No interest is charged on Directory customer receivables for the first 30 days from the date of the sale of goods: thereafter balances bear interest at a variable annual percentage rate of 26.49% 2007: 26.49%.
Expected irrecoverable amounts on balances between 30 and 120 days overdue are provided for based on past default experience.
Customer receivables which are more than 120 days overdue are considered to be impaired and are provided for in full.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not include impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of asset above.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

Equity settled share based payments continued The fair value of management and sharesave options granted is calculated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for options granted in the years ended 27 January 2007 and 26 January 2008 based on information at the date of grant: Management share options 2008 2007 Weighted average share price at date of grant p 2189 1620 Weighted average exercise price p 2189 1620 Volatility % 21.00 25.00 Expected life years 4.00 4.00 Risk free rate % 5.37 4.56 Dividend yield % 2.24 2.72 Weighted average fair value 4.45 3.31 Sharesave plans 2008 2007 Weighted average share price at date of grant p 1969 1892 Weighted average exercise price p 1576 1514 Volatility % 23.31 21.44 Expected life years 3.53 3.58 Risk free rate % 4.98 4.99 Dividend yield % 2.49 2.38 Weighted average fair value 5.72 5.45 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.
The expected life applied in the model is based on historical analyses of exercise patterns, taking into account any early exercises.
Shares held by ESOT The Next 2003 Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT has an independent professional trustee resident in Jersey and provides for the issue of shares to Group employees, including share issues under share options, at the discretion of the Trustee.
At 26 January 2008 the ESOT held 4,587,161 2007: 6,441,692 ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company, the market value of which amounted to 63.1m 2007: 125.4m.
Details of outstanding share options are shown in Note 27.
The consideration paid for the ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company held by the ESOT at 26 January 2008 and 27 January 2007 has been shown as an ESOT reserve and presented within equity for the Company and the Group.
All other assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOT have been incorporated into the accounts of the Company and the Group.
Financial instruments: risk management Next operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks associated with the Groups activities.
As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the Group uses derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, instrument types and transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash and short term deposits, bank overdrafts, loans and corporate bonds.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.
68 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 29.
Financial instruments: risk management continued Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within risk parameters agreed by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of its businesses.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities: 2008 Less than 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years Over 5 years Total m m m m m Bank loans and overdrafts 246.8 246.8 Trade and other payables 354.4 354.4 Finance lease liabilities 0.5 0.4 0.7 0.4 2.0 Other liabilities 53.6 8.9 62.5 Corporate bonds 30.4 30.4 91.3 624.5 776.6 685.7 30.8 100.9 624.9 1,442.3 Derivatives: net settled 3.1 2.0 6.2 2.0 13.3 Derivatives: gross settled Cash inflows 420.6 7.6 428.2 Cash outflows 410.4 6.8 417.2 Total cash flows 678.6 32.0 107.1 626.9 1,444.6 2007 Less than 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years Over 5 years Total m m m m m Bank loans and overdrafts 12.6 12.6 Trade and other payables 349.1 349.1 Finance lease liabilities 0.6 0.5 0.9 0.6 2.6 Other liabilities 7.6 7.6 Corporate bonds 30.4 30.4 91.3 654.9 807.0 392.7 30.9 99.8 655.5 1,178.9 Derivatives: net settled 1.6 2.8 10.4 7.1 21.9 Derivatives: gross settled Cash inflows 555.3 0.4 555.7 Cash outflows 579.1 0.4 579.5 Total cash flows 418.1 33.7 110.2 662.6 1,224.6 At 26 January 2008 the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 450.0m 2007: 450.0m in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met, 300.0m of which expires in September 2009 and 150.0m in November 2010.
205.0m of the 2009 facility was drawn down at 26 January 2008 2007: nil.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate corporate bonds and cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored regularly to assess the mix of fixed and variable rate debt, and the Group uses interest rate derivatives where appropriate to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates and the economic environment.
69 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 29.
Financial instruments: risk management continued Foreign currency risk The Groups principal foreign currency exposures arise from the purchase of overseas sourced products.
Group policy allows for but does not demand that these exposures are hedged for up to 18 months ahead in order to fix the cost in sterling.
This hedging activity involves the use of spot, forward and option contracts.
The Groups net exposure to foreign currencies is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in Note 33.
The market value of outstanding foreign exchange derivatives is reported regularly at Board level, and reviewed in conjunction with percentage cover taken by season and current market conditions in order to assess and manage the Groups ongoing exposure.
The Group does not have a material exposure to currency movements in relation to translation of overseas assets or liabilities and consequently does not hedge any such exposure.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are detailed in the table below.
The Groups net exposure to foreign currencies, taking hedging activities into account is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in Note 33.

All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The Groups outstanding receivables balances are detailed in Note 14.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as analysed in Note 34, and equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in Note 26.
The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities within the Group continue as going concerns while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of its strategy for delivering long term sustainable growth in earnings per share, the Group has been returning capital to shareholders by way of share buy backs in addition to dividends.
Share buy backs are transacted through both on-market purchases and contingent contracts for off-market share purchases.

Financial instruments: hedging activities Cash flow hedges The Group uses derivative instruments in order to manage foreign currency exchange risk arising on expected future purchases of overseas sourced products during the next twelve months.
These derivatives comprise forward currency contracts and currency options, the terms of which have been negotiated to match the terms of the expected purchases.
Fair values of foreign exchange derivatives are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Derivatives in designated hedging relationships 11.3 19.9 Other foreign exchange derivatives 0.1 2.5 Total foreign exchange derivatives 11.2 22.4 The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts to which the Group was committed at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts 428.2 555.7 Fair value hedges At 27 January 2007 and 26 January 2008, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys 2013 300m 5.25% fixed rate corporate bond.
Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same critical terms as the bond, the Group receives a fixed rate of interest of 5.25% and pays a combination of a variable rate and a lower fixed rate.
Details of the effective rates payable are given in Note 20.
The fair values of the interest rate swaps are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Derivatives in designated hedging relationships 12.3 19.4 Other interest rate derivatives 0.2 Total interest rate derivatives 12.3 19.2 The fair values of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and are based on market prices at the balance sheet date.

Financial instruments: sensitivity analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the Directors assessment of a reasonably possible change.
The analysis assumes that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the fair value reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
For foreign exchange derivatives which are not designated hedges, movements in exchange rates impact the income statement.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
Financial instruments: sensitivity analysis continued Year end exchange rates applied in the above analysis are US dollar 1.98 2007: 1.96 and Euro 1.35 2007: 1.52.
Strengthening and weakening of Sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and nature of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 0.5% represents the Directors assessment of a reasonably possible change.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.

The Group has entered into operating leases in respect of vehicles, equipment, warehouses, office equipment and retail stores.
These non-cancellable leases have remaining terms of between 3 months and 24 years.
Contingent rentals are payable on certain retail store leases based on store revenues.
The majority of the Groups operating leases provide for their renewal by mutual agreement at the expiry of the lease term.
