In determining whether the carrying value is at the lower of cost or net realisable value, a review is carried out on each individual development site Granton Harbour, Western Harbour, The Harbour, Leith Docks and Leith Docks at 31st December each year.
The estimated sales receipts are assessed for each development as are the existing costs and the expected costs to complete including sales costs which are then compared with the carrying value.
With the significant reduction in land values over the past year, the average unit selling price has reduced between 15% and 35% depending on the development site location and property type.
The effect of this has reduced the net realisable value of property work in progress by 27.7m 2007 nil leaving a carrying value of 25.4m 2007 48.7m.
