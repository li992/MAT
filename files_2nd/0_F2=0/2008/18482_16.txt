Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year, is set out below.
a Basis of accounting The consolidated accounts have been prepared and approved in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by, or adopted by, the International Accounting Standards Board the IASB, interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards Committee, applicable legal and regulatory requirements of The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The consolidated accounts give a true and fair view and are also in compliance with The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trust companies issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009 which has been adopted early is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
The notes and financial statements are presented in pounds sterling functional and presentational currency and are rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenue and expenses during the period.
The nature of the estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
The following new standards have been issued but are not effective for 2008 and have not been early adopted: In November 2006, the IASB issued IFRS 8 OperatingSegments which becomes effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
This standard requires disclosure on the financial performance of the Groups operating segments.
In March 2007, the IASB issued IAS 23 Borrowing Costs amendment, which becomes effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
This standard requires that all borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset form part of the cost of the asset.
In September 2007, the IASB issued IAS 1  amendment, which becomes effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
This standard prescribes the basis of presentation of general purpose financial statements to ensure comparability both with the entitys financial statements of previous periods and with the financial statements of other entities.
In January 2008, the IASB issued IAS 27  amendment which becomes effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
The objective of this standard is to enhance the relevance, reliability and comparability of the information that a parent entity provides in its separate financial statements and in its consolidated financial statements for a group of entities under its control.
The Group does not consider that the future adoption of the above new standards, in the form currently available, will have any material impact on the financial statements as presented.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are those entities, including special purpose entities, controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The Company owns 100 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of F&C Commercial Property Holdings Limited, a company incorporated in Guernsey whose principal business is that of an investment and property company.
The Group also consolidates the results of F&C Commercial Property Finance Limited, a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Guernsey to issue the interest-bearing bonds.
c Revenue recognition Rental income, excluding VAT, arising on investment properties is accounted for in the Income Statement on a straightline basis over the lease term of ongoing leases.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Distribution income received from the indirect property funds is recognised in the period to which the payment relates.
Interest income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 29 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued d Expenses Expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
The Groups investment management and administration fees, finance costs and all other expenses are charged through the Income Statement.
e Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit loss before taxation reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
As the Directors consider the value of the property portfolio is likely to be realised by sale rather than use over time, no provision has been made for deferred tax on valuation uplifts.
f Investment properties Investment properties consist of land and buildings held to earn rental income together with the potential for capital and income growth.
Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of consideration given, including associated transaction costs.
Any subsequent capital expenditure incurred in improving investment properties is capitalised in the period during which the expenditure is incurred and included within the book cost of the properties.
After initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses recognised in the Income Statement and transferred to the Capital Reserve Investments Held.
Fair value is based on the open market valuation provided by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited, chartered surveyors, at the balance sheet date.
Investment properties held under finance leases and leased out under operating leases are classified as investment properties and stated at fair value.
On derecognition, realised gains and losses on disposals of investment properties are recognised in the Income Statement and transferred to the Capital Reserve Investments Sold.
Recognition and derecognition occurs on the exchange of signed contracts between a willing buyer and a willing seller.
g Investments Investments in unquoted indirect property funds are recognised and derecognised on the trade date, and are initially measured at fair value.
Investments in unquoted indirect property funds are classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
h Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being property investment, and in one geographical area, the United Kingdom.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash in banks and short term deposits are carried at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and short term deposits in banks with an original maturity of three months or less.
Accounting policies continued j Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which are generally due for settlement at the relevant quarter end, are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
k Interest-bearing borrowings All non-current borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being fair value of the consideration received, net of arrangement costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any loan arrangement costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Fees 2008 2007 000 000 a Investment management fee 5,862 9,430 Throughout the year the Groups investment manager was F&C Investment Business Limited FCIB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of F&C Asset Management plc.
During the year, following the establishment of F&C REIT Asset Management LLP through the combination of the property management business of FCIB with REIT Asset Management, the property management arrangements of the Group were delegated by FCIB, with the approval of the Company, to F&C REIT Property Asset Management plc, a subsidiary of F&C REIT Asset Management LLP.
Notwithstanding the delegation of some of the management functions, FCIB remains the Groups investment manager.
At the beginning of the year, FCIB was entitled to an investment management fee from the Group at an annual rate of 0.75 per cent of the total assets less current liabilities, payable quarterly in arrears.
During the year, the Board agreed terms with FCIB for a reduction in the base management fee payable and the introduction of a performance fee.
Under the new arrangements, FCIB is entitled to a base management fee of 0.60 per cent per annum of the Groups invested assets including indirect property holdings and 0.25 per cent per annum of the net current assets, payable quarterly in arrears.
The revised base fee took retrospective effect from 19 March 2008.
The fees of any managing agents appointed by the investment manager are payable out of the management fee.
Under the new arrangements, FCIB is also entitled to a performance fee equal to 20 per cent of the amount by which the total return whether positive or negative on the directly held properties exceeds 110 per cent of the total return 90 per cent if the total return is negative on the benchmark and multiplied by the Groups average total assets excluding any indirect property holdings.
The benchmark for measuring the comparative performance of directly held properties is the total return from the IPD All Quarterly and Monthly funds.
The performance fee payable in each financial year is capped at an amount which, when taken with the aggregate base management fee payable in each financial year, equals 1.0 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
Performance fees in excess of this capped return can be carried forward for up to two subsequent financial years subject to the annual 1.0 per cent cap.
The performance fee is measured over a rolling three year period and the performance fee payable in respect of any one financial year is equal to the total performance fee earned over that three year period less any performance fees already paid in the previous two years.
In the event that the amount already paid in the previous two years is in excess of the amount earned over the rolling three year period, such excess shall be repaid to the Group by FCIB.
The first performance fee was calculated for the period from 31 March 2008 to 31 December 2008.
However, for that period, the total return from the directly held properties did not exceed the adjusted total return on the benchmark index.
Therefore, no performance fee is payable in respect of that period.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 31 Notes to the Accounts continued 2.
Fees continued FCIB is also entitled to an administration fee of 100,000 per annum which increases annually in line with inflation, payable quarterly in arrears.
The investment manager received 107,000 for administration services provided in respect of the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: 103,000.
At 31 December 2008 the investment management agreement may have been terminated by either party by giving not less than 12 months notice.
The agreement may be terminated earlier provided that a payment in lieu of notice, equivalent to the amount the investment manager would otherwise have received during the notice period, is made.
Since the year end the Board has agreed terms with the Managers such that the investment management agreement may now be terminated by either party by giving not less than 6 months notice.
b Valuers fees The valuers of the investment properties, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited, have agreed to provide valuation services in respect of the property portfolio.
The valuation agreement is for a fixed term up to 31 December 2010 and an annual fee is payable equal to 0.0165 per cent of the aggregate value of the direct property portfolio.
Other expenses 2008 2007 000 000 Direct operating expenses of let rental property 2,669 2,488 Provision for bad debts 225 17 Valuation and other professional fees 617 567 Directors fees 143 119 Administration fee 107 103 Auditors remuneration for: audit current year 50 34 audit prior year underprovision 20 other services 14 7 Other 252 299 4,097 3,600 An analysis of the Directors fees is provided in the Report of the Directors on page 17.

The Company is exempt from Guernsey taxation under the Income Tax Exempt Bodies Guernsey Ordinance, 1989.
A fixed annual fee of 600 is payable to the States of Guernsey in respect of this exemption.
No charge to Guernsey taxation will arise on capital gains.
The Directors intend to conduct the Groups affairs such that the management and control is not exercised in the United Kingdom and so that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries carries on any trade in the United Kingdom.
Accordingly, the Company and its subsidiaries will not be liable for United Kingdom taxation on their income or gains other than certain income deriving from a United Kingdom source.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to United Kingdom income tax on income arising on the property portfolio after deduction of its allowable debt financing costs and other allowable expenses.

Dividends 2008 2007 000 000 In respect of the previous period: Third interim dividend 10,875 11,025 Fourth interim dividend 10,687 11,025 In respect of the year under review: First interim dividend 10,650 10,920 Second interim dividend 10,650 10,875 Third interim dividend 7,060 49,922 43,845 A fourth interim dividend of 0.5 pence per share totalling 3,403,000 was paid on 30 January 2009, a fifth interim dividend of 0.5 pence per share totalling 3,403,000 was paid on 27 February 2009 and a sixth interim dividend of 0.5 pence per share totalling 3,403,000 was paid on 27 March 2009 to shareholders on the register on 6 March 2009.
A seventh, and last, interim dividend for the year of 0.5 pence per share, expected to total 3,403,000, will be paid on 24 April 2009 to shareholders on the register on 3 April 2009.
Although these payments relate to the year ended 31 December 2008, under International Financial Reporting Standards they will be accounted for in the year ending 31 December 2009, being the year during which they are paid.
It is the Directors intention that the Company will continue to pay dividends monthly.
Losses per share The Groups basic and diluted losses per Ordinary Share are based on the loss for the year of 284,119,000 2007: 44,332,000 and on 713,355,033 2007: 732,816,052 Ordinary Shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Investments 2008 2007 000 000 Freehold and leasehold properties Opening book cost 785,898 782,498 Opening unrealised appreciation 192,527 264,482 Opening valuation 978,425 1,046,980 Sales proceeds 67,513 31 loss gain on sale 2,015 31 Capital expenditure 3,043 3,400 Insurance proceeds received 3,789 Unrealised gains realised during the year 2,122 Decrease in unrealised appreciation 251,874 71,955 654,155 978,425 Closing book cost 715,624 785,898 Closing unrealised depreciation appreciation 61,469 192,527 Closing valuation 654,155 978,425 34 F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited 9.
Investments continued 2008 2007 000 000 Indirect property funds Opening book cost 97,730 133,947 Opening unrealised appreciation 20,921 47,930 Opening valuation 118,651 181,877 Sales proceeds 43,790 50,188 loss gain on sale 19,603 13,971 Unrealised gains realised during the year 14,589 12,383 Decrease in unrealised appreciation 35,553 14,626 5,116 118,651 Closing book cost 34,337 97,730 Closing unrealised depreciation appreciation 29,221 20,921 Closing valuation 5,116 118,651 All the Groups investment properties were valued as at 31 December 2008 by qualified professional valuers working for the company of DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited DTZ, Chartered Surveyors, acting in the capacity of external valuers.
All such valuers are Chartered Surveyors, being members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
DTZ completed the valuation of the Groups investment properties at 31 December 2008 on a market value basis and in accordance with the requirements of the RICS Valuation Standards under which market value is deemed to equate to fair value.
Fair value is the amount for which the assets could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The value of these investment properties amounted to 654,155,000 2007: 978,425,000.
The DTZ valuation report is dated 15 January 2009 the Valuation Report.
Gillian Rushmore BSc, FRICS has been the signatory of valuation reports provided to the Group for the same purpose as the Valuation Report for a continuous period since March 2005.
DTZ has been carrying out valuations for the Group for the same purpose as the Valuation Report for the same period.
DTZ also values properties held by other companies for which the F&C Asset Management plc group is also the investment manager.
DTZ provides and has provided in the past ad hoc investment and occupational agency advice, landlord and tenant and building consultancy advice to members of the F&C Asset Management plc group.
DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DTZ Holdings plc.
In DTZ Holdings plcs financial year to 30 April 2008, the proportion of total fees payable by the F&C Asset Management plc group to the total fee income of DTZ Holdings plc was less than five per cent.
Financial markets have seen significant turbulence over the last year or so resulting in severe liquidity shortages.
This turmoil has had an immediate effect on the real estate investment market resulting in some transactions failing and or prices being renegotiated downwards.
This has caused a marked reduction in the volume of transactions with activity below the levels of recent years.
Generally, there is greater volatility in the evidence generated by comparable transactions and in these circumstances there is a greater degree of uncertainty than that which exists in a more active and stronger market in forming an opinion of the realisation prices of property assets.
Therefore, DTZ has indicated that, in the market conditions which currently prevail, there is likely to be a greater than usual degree of uncertainty in respect of valuations.
Until the number and consistency of comparable transactions increases, this situation is likely to remain.
The Group has adopted IAS 40 revised 2003, allowing leasehold properties to be carried at fair value rather than amortised over the term of the lease.
The same valuation criteria are therefore applied to leasehold as freehold properties.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 35 Notes to the Accounts continued 9.
Investments continued The property valuer is independent and external to the Group.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation, when the Managers advise the presence of such materials.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 19 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
All of the properties per open market value are shown on page 13.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Groups investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise as described in Liquidity risk in note 17.
The Board has appointed an independent valuer to place a market valuation on the units held in the indirect property funds for the Directors to consider.
Market value, which is deemed to equate to fair value, means the estimated amount for which units could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
Therefore, similar to the direct property portfolio, there is likely to be a greater than usual degree of uncertainty in respect of the valuation of the indirect property funds in the market conditions which currently prevail.
The Group is under no contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop any investment property.
The majority of leases are on a full repairing basis and as such the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs, maintenance or enhancements to its investment properties.
Trade and other receivables 2008 2007 000 000 Accrued income 3,282 2,934 Rents receivable net of provision for bad debts 1,481 1,274 Other debtors and prepayments 1,430 1,468 6,193 5,676 Rents receivable, which are generally due for settlement at the relevant quarter end, are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents All cash balances at the year end were held in cash, current accounts or in banks on short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The cash balance at 31 December 2008 includes 2,344,000 2007: 3,263,000 of rent deposits and therefore a corresponding creditor is included within trade and other payables.
Trade and other payables 2008 2007 000 000 Rental income received in advance 9,763 11,960 VAT payable 839 1,198 Managers fees payable 1,271 2,210 Tax payable 466 Other payables 1,986 3,122 13,859 18,956 The Groups payment policy is to ensure settlement of supplier invoices in accordance with stated terms.

The bonds carry interest at a fixed rate of 5.23 per cent per annum and have an expected maturity date of 30 June 2015.
If the bonds are not redeemed at this date they will carry interest at 0.60 per cent over six-month LIBOR until the final maturity date of 30 June 2017.
These bonds are secured by means of a fixed and floating charge over the whole of the assets of the Group.
Under the covenant relating to the bonds the Company is to ensure that: the loan to value percentage remains less than, or equal to, 50 per cent defined as financial indebtedness expressed as a percentage of gross secured asset value : the secured loan to value percentage remains less than, or equal to, 40 per cent defined as the principal amount outstanding on the bonds expressed as a percentage of gross secured asset value : the interest cover ratio is greater than 1.5 times on any calculation date: payments are not made in respect of shares unless the ratio of free cash flow to interest is greater than 2.0 times and, after deduction of an amount equal to the proposed payment, greater than 1.75 times: no single property measured by market value accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross asset value: the sector weightings measured by market value do not exceed the following percentages of the gross asset value: All industrial: 40 per cent: All office: 50 per cent: All retail: 65 per cent: the five largest properties measured by market value do not exceed 40 per cent of the gross asset value: no single tenant exceeds 15 per cent of the total annual net rental income from the properties: the five largest tenants do not exceed 40 per cent of the total annual net rental income from the properties: and short leasehold properties measured by market value do not exceed 10 per cent of the gross asset value.

In both cases it was intended that the amount so arising would be transferred to the special reserve to be available for all purposes permitted under Guernsey law including the buying back of shares and the payment of dividends.
Approval of the Court in Guernsey was received on 14 March 2008 resulting in an amount of 679.6 million being transferred from share capital to the special reserve, in respect of the reduction of the nominal value of the ordinary share capital currently listed, and 14.4 million being transferred from share premium to the special reserve, in respect of the cancellation of the share premium account.
Ordinary Shareholders are entitled to all dividends declared by the Company and to all of the Companys assets after repayment of its borrowings and ordinary creditors.
Ordinary Shareholders have the right to vote at meetings of the Company.
All Ordinary Shares carry equal voting rights.

Special reserve The special reserve was originally created by the cancellation of the Companys Share Premium Account by the Royal Court of Guernsey in July 2005.
It is a distributable reserve to be used for all purposes permitted under Guernsey law, including the buy back of shares and the payment of dividends.
Capital reserve investments sold previously capital reserve realised The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the disposal of investments and investment properties, including the transfer of any unrealised gains now realised which were previously recognised through Capital Reserve Investments Held: and the buy back of shares up to the balance on this reserve, thereafter any buy back of shares are charged to the Special Reserve.
The name of this reserve has been changed to reflect the requirements of the AIC SORP issued in January 2009, which has been adopted early.
Capital reserve investments held previously capital reserve unrealised The following are accounted for in this reserve: increases and decreases in the fair value of investment properties held at the year end: and increases and decreases in the fair value of investments in indirect property funds held at the year end.
Revenue reserve Any surplus arising from the profit after taxation after payment of dividends is taken to this reserve, with any deficit up to the level of the special reserve being transferred from that reserve.
Capital management The Groups capital is represented by the Ordinary Shares, Capital Redemption Reserve, Share Premium Account, Special Reserve, Capital Reserve Investments Sold, Capital Reserve Investments Held and Revenue Reserve.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
The capital of the Group is managed in accordance with its investment policy, in pursuit of its investment objective, both of which are detailed in the Report of the Directors on pages 15 and 16.
Net asset value per share The Groups net asset value per Ordinary Share of 85.8p 2007: 130.8p is based on equity shareholders funds of 584,183,000 2007: 958,087,000 and on 680,537,003 2007: 732,534,003 Ordinary Shares, being the number of shares in issue at the year-end.

Financial instruments The Companys investment objective is to provide ordinary shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for capital and income growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
In addition, the Groups financial instruments comprise interest-bearing bonds, cash and receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
The Group does not have exposure to any derivative instruments.
The Group is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with financial instruments.
The most important types are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and market price risk.
There is no foreign currency risk as assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds sterling.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing the Groups risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and have remained unchanged for the year under review.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
At the reporting date, the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities exposed to credit risk amounted to the following on a contractual maturity basis : Within More than one year 12 years 25 years 5 years Total Financial assets 000 000 000 000 000 As at 31 December 2008 Investments in indirect property funds 5,116 5,116 Cash and cash equivalents 162,336 162,336 Rents receivable 1,481 1,481 As at 31 December 2007 Investments in indirect property funds 118,651 118,651 Cash and cash equivalents 103,891 103,891 Rents receivable 1,274 1,274 Financial liabilities As at 31 December 2008 Trade and other payables 13,859 13,859 Interest bearing bonds 12,029 12,029 36,087 248,044 308,189 As at 31 December 2007 Trade and other payables 18,956 18,956 Interest bearing bonds 12,029 12,029 36,087 260,073 320,218 40 F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited 17.
Financial instruments continued In the event of default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Managers monitor such reports in order to anticipate, and minimise the impact of, defaults by occupational tenants.
The Group has a diversified tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2008 was 1,481,000 2007: 1,274,000.
As at 31 December 2008, rent receivable of 360,000 that was greater than three months overdue was fully provided for.
As at 31 December 2007 the provision was 135,000.
Of this amount 15,000 was subsequently written off, 30,000 is still outstanding and 90,000 was recovered.
Apart from the rent receivable disclosed above there were not any financial assets which were either past due or considered impaired at 31 December 2008 2007: nil.
All of the Groups cash is placed with financial institutions with a long term credit rating of AA or better.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of such financial institutions may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, cash holdings would be moved to another bank.
During the year, due to the quantum of cash balances held, counterparty risk was spread by placing cash across a number of different financial institutions.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
The Groups investments comprise UK commercial property.
Property and property-related assets in which the Group invests are not traded in an organised public market and may be illiquid.
As a result, the Group may not be able to liquidate quickly its investments in these properties at an amount close to their fair value in order to meet its liquidity requirements.
Given the current turmoil in financial markets, as described in note 9, there has been significantly less liquidity in property markets in recent months.
The Groups liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Managers and monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board.
In order to mitigate liquidity risk the Group aims to have sufficient cash balances including the expected proceeds of any property sales to meet its obligations for a period of at least twelve months.
In certain circumstances, the terms of the Groups listed bonds entitle the bondholders to require early repayment and, in such circumstances, the Groups ability to maintain dividend levels and the net asset value attributable to the ordinary shares could be adversely affected.
The Groups investments include investments in indirect property funds which are not traded in an organised public market and which generally may be illiquid.
As a result, similar to the directly-held properties, the Group may not be able to liquidate quickly some of its investments in those instruments in order to meet its liquidity requirements.
As at 31 December 2008 the Groups investment in indirect property funds was 5,116,000 2007: 118,651,000.
Interest rate risk Some of the Groups financial instruments are interest-bearing.
They are a mix of both fixed and variable rate instruments with differing maturities.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing market rate.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations.
Interest rate risk on long-term debt obligations is managed by fixing the interest rate on such borrowings.
Long-term debt obligations and the interest rate risk they confer to the Group is considered by the Board on a quarterly basis.
Long-term debt obligations consist of 230 million Secured Bonds due 2017 on which the rate has been fixed at 5.23 per cent until the expected maturity date of 30 June 2015.
If the bonds are not redeemed at this date they will carry interest at 0.6 per cent over LIBOR until the final maturity date of 30 June 2017.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 41 Notes to the Accounts continued 17.
Financial instruments continued The following table sets out the carrying amount of the Groups financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk: Assets Weighted liabilities Weighted average where no average period for Fixed Variable interest is interest which rate Total rate rate received rate is fixed Type 000 000 000 000 % years As at 31 December 2008 Financialassets Cash and cash equivalents 162,336 130,922 31,414 2.41 0.1 Rents receivable 1,481 1,481 Financialliabilities 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds due 2017 229,197 229,197 5.29 6.5 As at 31 December 2007 Financialassets Cash and cash equivalents 103,891 103,891 5.68 Rents receivable 1,274 1,274 Financialliabilities 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds due 2017 229,093 229,093 5.29 7.5 Apart from the 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds as disclosed in note 13, the fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying value in the financial statements.
Considering the effect on the Secured Bonds, it is estimated that an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates as at the balance sheet date would have decreased their fair value by approximately 17,314,000 2007: 19,060,000, a decrease of 150 basis points would have increased their fair value by approximately 19,166,000 2007: 21,359,000.
The carrying value of the Secured Bonds in the financial statements would have remained unchanged.
When the Group retains cash balances, they are ordinarily held on interest-bearing deposit accounts.
The benchmark which determines the interest income received on interest-bearing cash balances is the bank base rate which was 2.0 per cent as at 31 December 2008 2007: 5.5 per cent.
The Companys policy is to hold cash in variable rate or short-term fixed rate bank accounts and not usually in fixed rate securities with a term greater than three months.
Considering the effect on cash balances, an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates would have increased net assets and income for the year by 2,435,000 2007: 1,558,000.
A decrease of 150 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The calculations are based on the cash balances at the respective balance sheet dates.
Market price risk The Groups strategy for the management of market price risk is driven by the investment policy as outlined within the Report of the Directors on pages 15 and 16.
The management of market price risk is part of the investment management process and is typical of commercial property investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse valuation movements through detailed and continuing analysis, with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Investments in property and property-related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of each property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where such sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
Such risk is minimised through the appointment of external property valuers.
The basis of valuation of the property portfolio is set out in detail in note 9, which also highlights the greater than usual degree of uncertainty in respect of valuations in current market conditions.
Financial instruments continued Market price risk continued The Group also holds investments in indirect property funds which in turn invest directly in commercial property.
The underlying assets in such funds are valued by external property valuers appointed by the investment managers of the indirect property funds.
In addition to the price risk attaching to the underlying assets, such funds also carry the risk that the investment cannot be disposed of at its net asset value due to a lack of liquidity.
As at 31 December 2007, due to the technical requirements of IFRS and following extensive consultations with the Companys auditor, these investments were included in the financial statements at their underlying net asset value, although the Board indicated that they considered a discount of 10 per cent should be applied to such investments to reflect the likely realisable value of the holdings at that date.
In order to address the fact that the likely realisable value of the indirect property holdings at the balance sheet date may not be equal to each funds underlying net asset value, during the year the Board appointed an indirect valuer to obtain estimated market values for these holdings.
As at 31 December 2008, the fair value of these investments is deemed to be the Directors valuation, which reflects these independently produced market values.
Any changes in market conditions will directly affect the profit or loss reported through the Income Statement.
Details of the Groups investment property portfolio and indirect property funds held at the balance sheet date are disclosed on page 13.
A 15 per cent increase in the value of the direct properties at 31 December 2008 would have increased net assets and income for the year by 98,123,000 2007: 146,764,000.
A decrease of 15 per cent would have had an equal but opposite effect.
A 25 per cent increase in the values of the indirect property funds at 31 December 2008 would have increased net assets and income for the year by 1,279,000 2007: 29,663,000.
A decrease of 25 per cent would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The calculations above are based on the investment property and indirect property fund valuations at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Capital commitments The Group had capital commitments totalling 2,190,000 as at 31 December 2008 2007: 1,984,000.
Lease length The Group leases out its investment properties under operating leases.
The future income based on the unexpired lessor lease length at the year end was as follows based on annual rentals : 2008 2007 000 000 Less than one year 1,000 1,961 Between two and five years 34,838 45,889 Over five years 384,798 413,764 Total 420,636 461,614 The largest single tenant at the year end accounted for 5.7 per cent 2007: 5.2 per cent of the current annual rental income.
The unoccupied property expressed as a percentage of estimated total rental value excluding indirect property funds and properties under development was 4.3 per cent 2007: 1.2 per cent at the year end.
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio.
These properties, held under operating leases, are measured under the fair value model as the properties are held to earn rentals.
The majority of these non-cancellable leases have remaining non-cancellable lease terms of between 5 and 15 years.
Analyses of the nature of investment properties and leases are provided in the Managers Review on pages 9 to 12.
