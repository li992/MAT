Pension Scheme The companys defined benefit pension scheme based on final salary is now closed to new entrants.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the company.
The fund is under the control of trustees and is administered by Punter Southall & Co, consulting actuaries.
Actuarial valuations are obtained triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out in 2007 which disclosed a scheme deficit of 2,006,000 on 31 July 2007.
The company has agreed to meet this deficit over nine years by equal instalments.
It should be noted that this deficit differs from that disclosed by Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS17 which is set out below and which is the liability required to be shown in the financial statements.
The main reason for the difference is that FRS17 requires future liabilities to be calculated actuarially using a rate of return based on the yield from investment grade corporate bonds which is lower than the expected rate of return on the equities in which the scheme is invested.
The FRS17 liability is separately disclosed in the balance sheet.
For the defined benefits scheme the amounts charged against revenue, as part of staff costs, are the actuarial estimation of current service costs that is, the increase in scheme liabilities arising from employee service for the current accounting period and gains and losses from settlements whereby the company is relieved of a pension obligation and from curtailments whereby the estimated years of future service are reduced in the period.
The cost of past service benefits which have vested are charged against revenue as they arise.
Where such benefits have not vested costs are accrued until vesting occurs.
For employees who are not members of the defined benefits scheme, the company operates a defined contribution scheme under which the company has agreed to pay contributions as a percentage of salary, but has no obligation to pay further contributions.
For this scheme, the amount charged to revenue is the contributions payable for the year.
The following statement has been prepared for the defined benefits scheme in accordance with the requirements of FRS17, the purpose of which is to ensure that: 1. the companys financial statements show the assets of the scheme at fair value, and the liabilities arising from its obligations to employees on their retirement, actuarially estimated as prescribed by FRS17: 2. the operating costs of providing retirement benefits to employees, actuarially estimated, are charged against the profits of the years in which employees earn those benefits: and 3. the financial statements adequately disclose the cost of providing retirement benefits and the related gains, losses, assets and liabilities.

This is because the company is not expected to generate taxable profits in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing unrelieved expenses.
Dividends 2008 2007 000 000 Dividends paid on ordinary stock recognised in the year: Previous year final of 4.80p per unit 2006: 4.57p 6,368 6,531 Previous year special of 2.00p per unit 2006: 2.00p 2,655 2,860 Interim paid of 4.45p per unit 2007: 4.30p 5,805 5,974 14,828 15,365 Dividends paid take into account stock buybacks between the ex-dividend and payment dates.

Reserves continued The Company may only distribute accumulated realised profits.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, has issued guidance TECH 01 08, stating that profits arising out of the change in fair value of assets, recognised in accordance with Accounting Standards, may be distributed, provided the relevant assets can be readily converted into cash.
Securities listed on a recognised stock exchange are generally regarded as being readily convertible into cash and hence revaluation gains less losses on listed investments currently included within the Capital reserve unrealised may be regarded as distributable under company law.
However it should be noted that the companys articles of association prohibit the distribution of capital profits by way of dividend.

Financial Instruments continued Financial instruments, risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust the company invests in equities and other investments for the long-term so as to secure its investment objectives stated on page 1.
In pursuing its investment objective, the company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
The main risks include investment and market price risk comprising foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk and the directors approach to the management of them, is set out below.
The board of directors, the manager and the company secretary coordinate the companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks, set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
Investment and market price risk The holding of securities and investing activities involve certain inherent risks.
Events may occur which affect the value of investments.
The company holds a portfolio which is well diversified across industrial and geographical areas to help minimise these risks.
It may also use derivatives.
Trading in derivatives is not within the normal activities of an investment trust nor is it the companys policy to trade in such instruments.
However, from time to time the company may wish to use such instruments in order to protect against a specific risk or to facilitate a change in investment strategy such as the movement of funds from one area to another.
No such transaction may take place without the prior authorisation of the board.
Foreign currency risk Approximately 64% of the companys assets are invested overseas which gives rise to a currency risk.
This risk is monitored by the managers on a daily basis and by the board monthly.
From time to time specific hedging transactions are undertaken.
The companys overseas income is subject to currency movements.
During the year, US dollar dividend income was hedged by forward sales of US dollars.
The currency profile of the companys monetary assets and liabilities is set out in notes 8 and 13.
In accordance with FRS 13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures.
Management of the risk The manager monitors the companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis, and reports to the board at regular intervals.
The manager measures the risk to the company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts may be used to limit the companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments or the income received from them.
These borrowings and contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
40 The Scottish Investment Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year to 31 October 2008 18.
Financial Instruments continued Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the companys monetary items which have foreign currency exposure at 31 October 2008 are shown below.
The companys equity investments which are not monetary items which are priced in a foreign currency, have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
US $ Euro Other 2008 000 000 000 Debtors amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable and accrued income 133 366 Cash at bank 32,524 1,824 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 32,657 1,824 366 Equity investments at fair value through profit or loss 201,462 77,938 126,733 Total net foreign currency exposure 234,119 79,762 127,099 2007 Debtors amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable and accrued income 2,884 85 Cash at bank 1,985 12 24 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 4,869 12 109 Equity investments at fair value through profit or loss 201,980 146,640 199,028 Total net foreign currency exposure 206,849 146,652 199,137 The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of monetary foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
The maximum and minimum net monetary assets liabilities amounts for each currency were as follows.

Financial Instruments continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the total return for the year and the stockholders equity in regard to the companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
It assumes a 10% depreciation of sterling against both the US dollar and the euro.
These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
2008 2007 US $ Euro US $ Euro 000 000 000 000 If sterling had weakened by 10% against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: Income statement return on ordinary activities after taxation: Revenue return 162 423 202 270 Capital return 23,282 8,427 21,108 16,505 Return attributable to equity stockholders 23,444 8,850 21,310 16,775 A 10% strengthening of sterling against the above currencies would result in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analyses are broadly representative of the whole of the current and comparative years.
c. Interest rate risk The company finances its operations through a combination of investment realisations, retained revenue reserves, bank credit facilities, debenture stocks and secured bonds.
All of the existing debenture stocks and secured bonds are at fixed rates.
The company has undrawn short-term multicurrency line of credit facilities which can be drawn at variable rates of interest.
Details of interest rates on financial assets are included in note 8.
Details of interest rates on financial liabilities are included in note 13.
Management of the risk The company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels which have been approved and are monitored by the board.
The company, generally, does not, except in exceptional market conditions, hold significant cash balances.
Interest rate exposure The exposure, at the year end, of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to floating interest rates.
2008 2007 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash at bank 20,562 20,562 3,523 3,523 Exposure to fixed interest rates Short term deposits 61,662 61,662 69,000 69,000 Long term borrowings 107,492 107,492 107,372 107,372 Total exposure 82,224 107,492 25,268 72,523 107,372 34,849 42 The Scottish Investment Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year to 31 October 2008 18.
Financial Instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity If interest rates had decreased by 5% on the reporting date, with all other variables held constant, the return attributable to equity stockholders as shown on the Income Statement would have decreased by the amounts shown in the table below: 2008 2007 000 000 Income statement return on ordinary activities after taxation Revenue return 8 87 Capital return 161 161 Return attributable to equity stockholders 153 74 A 5% increase in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
d. Liquidity risk The majority of the companys assets comprise listed securities which represent a ready source of funds.
In addition the company has access to short-term borrowing facilities.
The maturity profile of the companys borrowings is included in note 13.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not as significant as the other risks as the majority of the companys assets are investments in quoted equities and are readily realisable.
The manager reviews the liquidity of the portfolio when making investment decisions.
e. Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk This risk is not significant, and is managed as follows: by only dealing with br okers which have been approved by the board of directors and banks, also approved by the board of directors, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies: and by setting limits as to the maximum exposur e to any one counterparty at any time.
These are reviewed semi-annually at meetings of the audit committee.
f. Capital management policies and procedures The company carries on its business as a global growth investment trust.
Its objective is to provide investors, over the longer term, with above average returns through a diversified portfolio of international equities and to achieve dividend growth ahead of UK inflation.
The levels of effective and potential gearing are monitored closely by the board and manager.
The company applies a ceiling on effective gearing of 120%.
While effective gearing will be employed in a typical range of 100% to 120%, the company retains the ability to lower equity exposure below 100% if deemed appropriate.
The board, with the assistance of the manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes the planned level of gearing which will take into account the managers view on the market, the need to buy back stock units for cancellation which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per stock unit and the stock price the company seeks to maintain a discount of 9% or less and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the previous year.
