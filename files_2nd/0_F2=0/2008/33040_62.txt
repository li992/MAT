Impairment tests of goodwill The group performs an annual goodwill impairment test, based on cash generating units CGUs.
BT Global Services is a CGU.
BT Retail comprises four CGUs: Consumer: Business: Enterprises: and BT Ireland.
These are the smallest identiable groups of assets that generate cash inows that have goodwill and are largely independent of the cash inows from other groups of assets.
The group has made a number of acquisitions in recent years, all of which have been fully integrated into the relevant line of business and CGU.
The groups reorganisation has not impacted the groups CGUs or the allocation of goodwill.
