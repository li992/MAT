Notes to the Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 A Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year and the previous year.
The particular policies adopted by the directors are described below.
Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are dealt with in the profit for the year.
Property, plant and equipment Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates ranging between: Freehold land Nil Freehold buildings 2% Leasehold property Over period of lease Computer hardware 33.3% Computer software 33.3% Furniture and office equipment 33.3% Motor vehicles 25% Plant and equipment 10% to 20% The costs of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
Investments Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Pensions The Company operates two principal pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff: the Interserve Pension Scheme which is of the defined benefit type and the Interserve Retirement Plan which is of the defined contribution type.
The Company also set up a new defined contribution section of the Interserve Pension Scheme with effect from 1 November 2002.
Actuarial valuations of the Interserve Pension Scheme are carried out every three years.
For the purposes of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the main Group Scheme, the Interserve Pension Scheme, on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Therefore, the Company will account for contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
Note 33 to the Annual report and financial statements of the Group sets out details of the IAS 19 net pension liability of 153.1 million 2007: 83.1 million.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the profit and loss account is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes during the year.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries or associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
100 Interserve Plc Annual report 2008 A Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are measured at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Financial instruments are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk management purposes only.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
To the extent that such instruments are matched to underlying assets or liabilities, they are accounted for using hedge accounting.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows and net investments are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had been previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or have not been designated as hedges, are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their economic risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
Convertible capital bonds Convertible capital bonds are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
The Company has a convertible capital bond receivable that is being carried at historic cost.
It has not been considered possible to value the separate components of the instrument on the basis that this is an equity instrument that does not have a quoted market price in an active market and the derivative which is linked to and must be settled by delivery of such an instrument is not reliably measurable.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after November 2002 that were unvested as of January 2004.
The Company issues share-based payments to certain employees of the Group headed by the Company.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value for grants pre 2006 was measured by the use of the Black-Scholes model and subsequently a stochastic model was used.
Note 32 to the Annual report and financial statements of the Group sets out details of the share-based payments.
The total value of equity-settled share-based payments is credited to the profit and loss reserve of the Company.
Share-based payments to employees of subsidiaries of the Company are recharged to the relevant employer.

As part of the Office of Fair Tradings ongoing review of tender activity in the construction sector, it wrote to the Group with regard to potential breaches of competition law in respect of 16 tenders submitted between 2000 and 2005.
These tenders represent a very small proportion of the bidding activity during this period.
In April 2008, the OFT published its Statement of Objections against 112 companies in the construction sector in England, including the Group.
The Statement of Objections alleges suspected cover pricing by the Group on three construction industry tenders between October 2000 and September 2001.
The Group has taken the opportunity to make representations before any final decision is made.
Given the stage of the OFTs review it is not possible to predict whether these enquiries will have a materially adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.
