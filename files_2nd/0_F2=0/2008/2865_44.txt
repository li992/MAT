The cash consideration paid was 74.9m with resulting goodwill of 53.4m.
Intangible valuations relating to this acquisition have been performed on a provisional basis and the exercise will be completed in the subsequent year.
During the year deferred consideration of 9.1m was settled in respect of acquisitions made in prior years, 7.8m was paid in cash and the remainder of 1.3m through the issue of loan notes, of which 9.4m had been previously provided: the impact of this was to reduce goodwill by 0.3m.
As required by IAS 12 deferred taxation is calculated on intangible assets recognised as a result of an acquisition, the impact of this was to increase goodwill in 2008 by 11.4m and to create a deferred tax liability of the same amount.
As a result of the above total goodwill of 134.7m was recognised in the year.
Acquisitions in the year included IBS OPENSystems plc now known as IBS OPENSystems Limited, ComputerLand UK PLC now known as ComputerLand UK Limited, Lancaster Insurance Services Limited, Nieuwenhuis Services BV now known as Capita Fiduciary BV, and ABS Network Solutions Limited.
For all acquisitions in the year the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of the acquired company.
Within goodwill are certain intangibles that were not separable from the acquirees and could not be measured reliably.
These items include customer loyalty and the assembled workforce.
The Groups acquisition of IBS OPENSystems Limited is the subject of a referral by the Office of Fair Trading OFT to the Competition Commission under section 22 1 of the Enterprise Act 2002.
The decision to refer this acquisition was made by the OFT on 19 November 2008, with the decision of the Competition Commission being anticipated in the first half of 2009.
