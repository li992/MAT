The write down in value of the intangible assets in relation to these products was determined based on value in use calculations using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the expected products cash flows over a period reflecting the patent-protected lives of the individual products.
The full period of projections are covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.6% for 2008 to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the individual products.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 14%.
The remaining $144m impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights results from the termination of development projects during the year.
The 2008 impairment of other intangibles results from a reassessment of the future royalties expected to be received relating to the HPV cervical cancer vaccine.
This impairment charge was determined using value in use calculations applying the same considerations as applied to the write down of Pulmicort Respules and Ethyol detailed above.
The impairment in 2007 was in relation to the termination of a product in development acquired with MedImmune and four collaboration agreements.
The impairment in 2006 was in relation to the termination of NXY-059 and a collaboration agreement.
