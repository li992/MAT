The maturity profile above is calculated on the basis that a facility to refinance a maturing loan is not recognised unless the facility and loan are related.
If refinancing under the Groups syndicated facility was recognised, then all amounts shown as repayable within one year would be reclassified as repayable between one and five years.
Undiscounted interest payments are estimated based on the year end applicable interest rate and spot exchange rates.
At 31 December 2008, short term assets available at the holding company level exceeded the amount of short term borrowings of 763m Euro Commercial Paper and Bank Loans.
