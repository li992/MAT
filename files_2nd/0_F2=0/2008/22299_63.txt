Back-End-Final-AW 17 4 09 14:36 Page 122 122 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 The Directors decided not to declare any bonus during 2008.
The bonus costs recognised in the year represent the accounting amortisation of bonuses declared in previous years.
During 2008, the Directors revisited the assumptions behind the calculation of the cost of matching bonus shares declared in 2007 and 2006 2007 revisited 2006 assumptions.
This led to an accounting reduction of the cost of 2.8m 2007 increase of 2.9m.
The Group will recognise similar adjustments each year to reflect the changing assumptions behind the calculations of matching shares.
See note 32 for details about matching shares.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payment, the Group recognised the costs in 2007 and 2008 as follows: Other creditors Bonus reserve Total cost recognised m m m Bonus recognised in 2008 2.6 4.6 7.2 Bonus recognised in 2007 12.1 8.5 20.6 The other creditors element of the bonus payable represents the element that will be payable in cash, whereas the bonus reserve represents the element that has been settled in shares.
The cash element includes the social security costs associated with the share element within bonus.
Other corporate undertakings creditors include 3.0m 2007 3.5m payable to PXRE Holdings Limited PXRE, resulting from the expected utilisation of tax losses purchased as part of the acquisition in 2005 of Chaucer Corporate Capital No.
The liability with PXRE represents the net present value of a liability that the Group is expects to settle in future years when profits on the taxation of the relevant years of account.
Other trade and other payables do not attract any significant discount and as a result, the carrying value of those liabilities materially equates to their fair value.
