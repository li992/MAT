The provisions cover rent voids while finding new tenants, shortfalls in expected rent receivable compared with rent payable and the cost of refurbishing the buildings to attract tenants.
Uncertainties arise from movements in market rents, delays in finding new tenants and the timing of rental reviews.

These relate to labour and overtime litigation claims brought by employees after leaving the bank.

The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain.

Step-up perpetual preferred securities a Guaranteed by HSBC Holdings The seven issues of non-cumulative step-up perpetual preferred securities footnote 1 were made by Jersey limited partnerships and are guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, by HSBC Holdings.
The proceeds of the issues were on-lent to HSBC Holdings by the limited partnerships by issue of subordinated notes.
The preferred securities qualify as innovative tier 1 capital for HSBC.
The preferred securities, together with the guarantee, are intended to provide investors with rights to income and capital distributions and distributions upon liquidation of HSBC Holdings that are equivalent to the rights that they would have had if they had purchased non-cumulative perpetual preference shares of HSBC Holdings.
The preferred securities are perpetual, but redeemable in 2014, 2010, 2030, 2012, 2016, 2013 and 2015, respectively, at the option of the general partner of the limited partnerships.
If not redeemed, the distributions payable step-up and become floating rate or, for the sterling issue, for each successive five-year period the sum of the then five-year benchmark UK gilt plus a margin.
There are limitations on the payment of distributions if prohibited under UK banking regulations or other requirements, if a payment would cause a breach of HSBCs capital adequacy requirements, or if HSBC Holdings has insufficient distributable reserves as defined.
HSBC Holdings has covenanted that if it is prevented under certain circumstances from paying distributions on the preferred securities in full, it will not pay dividends or other distributions in respect of its ordinary shares, or effect repurchase or redemption of its ordinary shares, until after a distribution has been paid in full.
If i HSBCs total capital ratio falls below the regulatory minimum ratio required, or ii the Directors expect that, in view of the deteriorating financial condition of HSBC Holdings, the former will occur in the near term, then the preferred securities will be substituted by preference shares of HSBC Holdings having economic terms which are in all material respects equivalent to those of the preferred securities and the guarantee taken together.

The two issues of preferred securities are perpetual, but redeemable in 2031 and 2020, respectively, at the option of the general partner of the limited partnerships.
If not redeemed, the distributions payable step-up and become floating rate.
The same limitations on the payment of distributions apply to HSBC Bank as to HSBC Holdings, as described above.
HSBC Bank has provided a similar covenant to that provided by HSBC Holdings, also as described above.
If i any of the two issues of preferred securities are outstanding in November 2048 or April 2049, respectively, or ii the total capital ratio of HSBC Bank on a solo and consolidated basis falls below the regulatory minimum ratio required, or iii in view of the deteriorating financial condition of HSBC Bank, the Directors expect ii to 426 occur in the near term, then the preferred securities will be substituted by preference shares of HSBC Bank having economic terms which are in all material respects equivalent to those of the preferred securities and the guarantee taken together.
