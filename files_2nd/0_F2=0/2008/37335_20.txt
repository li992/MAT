On entering the REIT regime an entry charge equal to 2% of the aggregate market value of the properties associated with the qualifying rental business was payable.
Deferred tax accrued at the date of conversion in respect of the assets and liabilities of the qualifying rental business was released to the income statement, as the relevant temporary differences are no longer taxable on reversal.
An equivalent release of deferred taxation was also made by the joint ventures, of which the Groups share was 98.0m.
The calculation of the Groups tax expense and liability necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be nally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authorities.
If all such issues are resolved in the Groups favour, provisions established in previous periods of up to 216.0m could be released in the future.

Accordingly, it excludes the effect of all exceptional items, debt and other restructuring charges, and other items of a capital nature other than trading properties and long-term contract pro ts as indicated above.
In addition, the corporation tax charge arising from the conversion to a REIT, and the deferred tax released following the conversion to a REIT, have also been excluded due to their size and incidence.
Further, prior to the conversion to a REIT, the deferred tax arising on capital allowances in respect of investment properties was eliminated as experience had shown that these allowances are not in practice repayable, and deferred tax on capitalised interest was also added back as this was effectively a permanent difference.
An EPRA measure has been included to assist comparison between European property companies.
We believe our measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share is more appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business.

In reviewing leases of land and buildings in accordance with IAS 17 the land and buildings elements of the lease need to be considered separately.
On this basis, leases on 43 properties entered into between 1923 and 2003 were reclassi ed as finance leases in these accounts.
This resulted in an increase in xed assets of 77.2m and a finance lease creditor of the same amount at first time adoption on 1 April 2004.
At 31 March 2008 leases on 25 properties 2007: 28 entered into between 1960 and 2007 were classi ed as finance leases.
The corresponding increase in xed assets and finance lease creditor was 67.3m 2007: 71.0m.
Operating lease expense has reduced by 6.7m 2007: 7.2m.
The fair value of the Groups investment properties at 31 March 2008 has been arrived at on the basis of a valuation carried out at that date by Knight Frank LLP, external valuers.
The valuation by Knight Frank LLP, which conforms to Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and with IVA 1 of the International Valuation Standards, and was arrived at by reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.

Impairment has been tested by comparing the carrying amount of the businesses assets and liabilities with their recoverable amount, being their value in use.
The latter has been calculated by reference to the cash ow projections for each business for its major contracts and covering the entire term of the contracts concerned.
The main assumptions underlying the forecasts are the relative in ation rates applying to costs and revenues and the amount of expenditure required for the businesses to ful l their service level commitments and the vacation rate under the DWP contract: and the volume of new business for SMIF management companies and IIC.
The cash ows are discounted at a rate re ecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to each business.

Trillium Investment Partners LP, prior to its partial disposal, had been classi ed as a non-current asset held for sale note 23.
Although the Group owns less than 20% of the equity, the Group believes that it exercises signi cant in uence over Trillium Investment Partners LP, through representation on the Supervisory Board as well as its capacity as general partner and investment adviser.
Consequently the Groups remaining interest in Trillium Investment Partners LP has been accounted for as an associate in accordance with IAS 28 Investment in Associates.

SMIF was acquired on 5 February 2007 for 517.0m excluding external debt repaid of 397.6m.
SMIF included a number of PPP investments which the Group acquired exclusively with a view to being resold to third party investors, while maintaining a minority share.
The Group transferred the majority of the PPP investments acquired with SMIF, together with a number of projects subsequently acquired, into a speci cally created vehicle, Trillium Investment Partners LP, for the purpose of introducing third party investors.
During the year Trillium Investment Partners LP was re nanced resulting in a repayment of 414.8m of debt.
On 14 March 2008, 90% of the equity of Trillium Investment Partners LP was sold to third party investors and the remaining 10%, which is to be retained, was transferred to an investment in an associate undertaking.
On disposal 23.9m was recognised as the income of Trillium Investment Partners LP as a discontinued operation, being the operational pro ts of the business from acquisition to 14 March.
The remaining balance represents a number of PPP investments which will be sold to Trillium Investment Partners LP or to third parties.
The net carrying value of the disposal group is based on its fair value less costs to sell at the date of acquisition, as adjusted to re ect cash advanced and cash returned from the disposal group.
The disposal group represents a discontinued operation, and the Group has not recognised any pro ts or losses in respect of this discontinued operation other than disclosed above for the period from acquisition to 31 March 2008.
The disposal group is held in the Trillium segment.

The amounts provided are based on the current estimate of the future costs determined on the basis of the present condition of the relevant properties.
Settlement of the amounts provided occurs once agreement is reached with the parties to the lease.
Onerous leases An onerous lease provision is established in respect of leasehold properties that are unoccupied or the expected future rental income is not expected to meet the Groups rental obligations.
The provisions are based on assumptions about expected future rentals and voids.
This provision will be settled as the net rental obligations develop.
The provision may vary based on reassessment of the relevant assumptions as circumstances change and new obligations are established.
Other Other provisions include liabilities arising from the contractual arrangements with clients that include speci c performance measurement targets and life cycle capital expenditure requirements.
Settlement of the amounts provided follows agreement with the clients.
It is expected that most of the other provisions will be utilised within the next three years.

The Notes and the committed bank facilities are secured on a xed and oating pool of assets The Security Group.
The debt investors bene t from security over a pool of investment properties valued at 11.0bn at 31 March 2008 2007: 11.6bn.
The nominal value borrowed against these assets was 5,595.2m 2007: 5,126.9m.
The secured debt structure has a tiered covenant regime which gives the Group substantial operational exibility when the loan to value and interest rate cover in The Security Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45 times respectively.
If these limits are exceeded, operational restrictions increase signi cantly and could act as an incentive to reduce gearing.
Euro Commercial Paper is unsecured.
However, the amount drawn is required to be supported by an unutilised committed bank facility, which is a secured facility.
The DWP term loan was re nanced in December 2006 and expires in December 2017.
It is secured on the freehold and long leasehold properties acquired from the Department for Work and Pensions.
The carrying amount of the properties concerned was 364.0m at 31 March 2008 2007: 380.4m.
At 31 March 2008, the Group had a 1.5bn syndicated bank facility with a maturity of August 2013.
The facility is committed and secured on the assets of The Security Group.
The maturity pro le is calculated on the basis that it is the Groups intention to retain the existing loans or that the existing loans will be re nanced or rescheduled with the same financial institutions under the terms of the facility.
During the year, the Group entered into three committed bilateral facilities all of which are secured on the assets of The Security Group.
In June 2007 the Group entered into a 150.0m facility, which has been extended in December 2007, as a 175.0m facility with an expiry in February 2010.
In July 2007 the Group entered into a 500.0m facility which was due to expire in July 2008, but a commitment has been obtained to replace it in July 2008 with a 350.0m facility with an expiry in July 2009.
In December 2007, the 1.0bn SMIF acquisition facility was repaid.
Another 350.0m facility was established in December 2007 which expires in October 2008.
The Group has an option to extend each of these bilateral facilities by a further year.
In December 2007, the Group acquired a share of Leeds Trinity Quarter which included a facility which has been re nanced post year end with a five year 352m committed facility secured on these assets.
The maturity pro le is calculated on the basis that it is the Groups intention to retain the existing loans or that the loans will be re nanced or rescheduled with the same financial institutions under the terms of the facility.
The acquisition loan notes were issued by Retail Property Holdings Trust Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, as partial consideration for the purchase of Tops Estates PLC and the LxB portfolio.
The notes are unsecured, however, they have the bene t of a commercial bank guarantee.
Interest is calculated with reference to six month LIBOR.
The notes are due to be redeemed in 2015, however, the holders of the notes can request redemption in full at the next interest payment date with at least 30 days notice.
Accordingly, the notes have been classi ed as current liabilities.
For foreign currency amounts, the nominal notional value is the Sterling equivalent of the principal amount at 31 March.
On 3 November 2004, a debt re nancing was completed resulting in the Group exchanging all of its outstanding bond and debenture debt for new Notes.
The new Notes did not meet the IAS 39 requirement to be substantially different from the debt that it replaced.
Consequently the book value of the new Notes is reduced to the book value of the original debt the bond exchange derecognition adjustment.
The adjustment is amortised to zero over the life of the new Notes.
Before the effect of derivative instruments.
The Groups Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts are assumed to approximate to their book values, as are the values of longer-term, oating rate bank loans.

This is achieved through a combination of controlling solvency, minimising nancing costs, managing risk, a rigorous investment appraisal framework and maintaining high standards of business conduct.
The key financial measures that are subject to review include cash ow projections and the ability to meet contracted commitments, projected gearing levels, interest covenants and dividend cover, although no absolute targets are set for these.
At 31 March 2008, including our joint ventures, our loan to value ratio was 47.9% 2007: 42.1% and interest cover was 1.93x 2007: 2.43x.
The Group monitors its cost of debt and its weighted average cost of capital WACC on a regular basis.
Investment and development opportunities are evaluated against the WACC in order to ensure that long-term shareholder value is created.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Land Securities Annual Report 2008 106 Notes to the financial statements continued 27.
Borrowings continued Financial risk factors The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Groups operations and debt nancing expose it to a variety of financial risks.
The main risks arising include credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, the latter in respect of both interest rates and foreign exchange.
The exposure to each risk, how it arises and policies for managing each risk for the year are summarised below: Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables and short-term investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and therefore the credit risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Property sales receivables primarily relate to the sale of six properties, for which all payments to date have been received when due, and as the purchasers are of reputable financial standing the credit risk is considered low.
Finance lease receivables relate to amounts receivable from tenants in respect of tenant finance leases.
This is not considered a signi cant credit risk as the tenants are generally of good financial standing.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited due to the Groups policy of monitoring counterparty exposures.
The Group has no signi cant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties.
Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has suf cient available funds for operations and committed investments.
The Groups undrawn committed borrowing facilities are monitored against projected cash ows.
The expiry periods of the Groups undrawn committed borrowing facilities are: 2008 2007 Group m m More than one year but not more than two years 25.0 More than two years but not more than five years 2.0 2.0 More than five years 584.0 1,077.1 611.0 1,079.1 The undrawn committed borrowing facilities are net of amounts drawn under both the syndicated bank facility and the Euro Commercial Paper.
Market risk The Group is exposed to market risk through interest rates, currency uctuations and availability of credit.
Interest rates The Group uses interest rate swaps and similar instruments forward rate agreements, forward starting swaps and gilt locks to manage its interest rate exposure.
With property and interest rate cycles typically of four to seven years duration, the Groups target is to have a minimum of 80% of anticipated debt at xed rates of interest and a maximum of 20% oating over this timeframe.
Due to a combination of factors, principally the high level of certainty required under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, hedging instruments used in this context do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Speci c hedges are also used in geared joint ventures to x the interest exposure on limited recourse debt.
At 31 March 2008 the Group including joint ventures had 2.3bn of hedges in place, and its debt was 80% xed.
Consequently, based on year end debt levels, a 1% change in interest rates would decrease or increase the Groups annual pro t before tax by 12.4m 2007: 8.6m.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
Foreign exchange Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Groups functional currency.
The Group does not normally enter into any foreign currency transactions as it is UK based.
However, the Group is able to raise debt in currencies other than Sterling, and where this occurs it is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of the exposure by entering into currency swaps to x the Sterling value of debt.
Therefore the Groups foreign exchange risk is low.
Financial maturity analysis The interest rate and currency pro les of the Groups undiscounted borrowings, after taking into account the effect of the foreign currency swaps and interest rate swaps, are set out below: Group 2008 2007 Fixed rate Floating rate Total Fixed rate Floating rate Total m m m m m m Sterling 4,402.5 1,552.7 5,955.2 5,458.4 207.6 5,666.0 Euro 26.9 26.9 4,402.5 1,552.7 5,955.2 5,458.4 234.5 5,692.9 Land Securities Annual Report 2008 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 107 27.

Net pension bene t assets obligations fide ned bene t schemes Land Securities Scheme The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies the Scheme is the most signi cant fide ned bene t pension scheme of the Group.
The Scheme is a wholly funded scheme, and the assets of the Scheme are held in a self-administered trust fund which is separate from the Groups assets.
Contributions to the Scheme are determined by a quali ed independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost will be expected to increase as a percentage of salary, under the projected unit method, as members approach retirement.
A full actuarial valuation of the Land Securities Scheme was undertaken on 1 July 2006 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson Consultants & Actuaries.
This valuation, and the latest formal valuation of the Land Securities Trillium Plan, was updated to 31 March 2008.
As a result of the valuation performed on 1 July 2006, the Trustees and the Group have agreed that the employer contributions of 30% of pensionable salary will be paid together with additional employer contributions to address the fide cit at that time.
Contributory money purchase scheme A contributory money purchase scheme was introduced on 1 January 1999 for all new administrative and senior property based employees, subject to eligibility, together with a separate similar scheme, effective 1 April 1998, for other property based employees.
A further separate similar scheme, previously set up by Trillium, is also in operation for their employees.
Pension costs for fide ned contribution schemes are as follows: 2008 2007 Group m m fide ned contribution schemes 2.0 1.8 All death-in-service and bene ts for incapacity arising during employment are wholly insured.
No post retirement bene ts other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.
The major assumptions used in the valuation, were in nominal terms : 2008 2007 Group % % # # Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.60 3.25 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.60 3.25 Discount rate 6.90 5.40 In ation 3.60 3.25 Expected return on plan assets 6.44 6.14 # plus an allowance of 1.25% per annum for promotional salary increases in respect of employee members of the Trillium Plan.
The expected return on plan assets is based on expectations for bonds and equities.
At the year end, the expected return on bonds is based on market yields of long dated bonds at that date.
The estimated expected return on equities includes an additional equity risk premium.

Share-based payments The Groups share-based payments are all equity-settled and comprise the Savings Related Share Option Schemes Sharesave, various Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS, Performance and Deferred Bonus share schemes related to the annual bonus scheme, and the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares or options that will eventually vest.
Fair value is calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme Under the 1993 and 2003 Savings Related Share Option Scheme all staff who have been with the Group for a continuous period of not less than six months are eligible to make regular monthly contributions into a Sharesave scheme operated by Lloyds TSB Bank Plc.
On completion of the three, five or seven year contract period, ordinary shares in Land Securities Group PLC may be purchased at a price based upon the current market price at date of invitation less 20% discount.
Options are satis ed by the issue of new shares.
Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the scheme before the options vest or lapse if options are not exercised within six months of the bonus date.
In certain circumstances leavers may exercise their options early based upon current savings.
Alternatively, they may continue saving to receive the tax-free bonus at the end of the contract or withdraw their cash immediately.
Fair value calculations, which relate to the 2003 Scheme only, assume a lapse rate, based upon historic values, of approximately 20% for employees leaving the Group before vesting.
