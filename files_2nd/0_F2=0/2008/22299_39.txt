Back-End-Final-AW 17 4 09 14:36 Page 101 101 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 4.
With effect from 1 January 2008, Syndicate 1084 assumed the reinsurance to close of the unnaturally open 2002, 2003 and 2004 years of account of Syndicate 1245, which ceased underwriting in 2004, for a reinsurance to close premium of 44.4m 3 Other represents other corporate income and expense items and a capital provision quota share in two of Chaucers corporate members.
4 The elimination of net expenses incurred in insurance activities in 2008 includes mainly recharges of a portion of the defined benefit pension scheme deficit from the managing agency to Syndicate 1084.
The portion recharged represents the contributions.
The recharges from managing agency include the profit commissions, managing agency fees and rent invoiced by the managing agency to Syndicates 1084 and 1176 during 2008 and 2007.
Consolidation eliminates the Groups share of the related income and expenses.
In addition, the actual expenses incurred by the managing agency shown as actual expenses transferred from managing agency above in managing the syndicates are reclassified as net expenses incurred in insurance activities from other operating expenses in each division.
The segmental information note shows these inter-segment transactions separately, in accordance with requirements of IAS 14 Segmental reporting.
The eliminations column eradicates these transactions.
The Group calculates expenses ratios on the net expenses incurred in insurance activities figure above, which includes the consolidation adjustments and reclassifications explained above.
This is in line with previous years practices.
5 The adjusted items in the divisional analysis exclude the effect of premiums and reserves relating to the reinsurance to close RITC of third party syndicates into Syndicate 1084 and Chaucers increased ownership of the RITC of Syndicates 1084 and 1176 following the closure of their 2005 years of account into their 2006 years.
The adjusted net earned premiums and the expenses incurred in insurance activities also reverse the mismatch caused by IFRS, which accounts for unearned premium reserves and deferred acquisition costs as non-monetary items and claims reserves as monetary items.
This adjustment provides a fairer representation of the underlying position.
The unadjusted items in the divisional analysis represent the items calculated in accordance with IFRS.
