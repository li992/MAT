This resulted in the selection of an expected long-term return on assets assumption of 7.61% to determine the pension cost for the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: 7.15%.
The expected long-term return on assets assumption to determine the pension cost for the year ending 31 December 2009 is 7.14%.
