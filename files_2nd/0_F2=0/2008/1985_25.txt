59 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Segment information a Primary reporting format business segments Following a review of the reportable segments, the directors consider that the group now has two business segments: textile maintenance and clinical solutions and decontamination.
The clinical solutions and decontamination business segment includes the Sunlight theatre textile business.
The prior year results have been restated accordingly.
Based on the risks and returns the directors consider that the primary reporting format is by business segment and that the secondary reporting format is by geographical analysis by origin and destination.
We provide additional disclosure for our secondary segment below.

Following the impairment test, it was determined that no impairment was required 2007: nil.
The recoverable amount for cash generating units has been measured based on a value-in-use calculation.
A weighted average pre-tax discount rate of 11.0% 2007: 11.0% was used in the value-in-use calculation.
The allocation of goodwill to cash generating units CGU by geographical segments is as follows: As at As at 31st December 31st December 2008 2007 m m UK and Ireland 74.7 74.0 Nordic 253.7 193.1 Continent 159.6 116.6 Total 488.0 383.7 In testing goodwill for impairment, the recoverable amount of each CGUs goodwill is calculated, based on an estimate of their discounted future cash flows.
Future cash flows are based on board approved budgets and strategic plans for a period of the next three years.
Forecasts for the following years are conservatively extrapolated based on the growth rate and profitability outlined in the approved plans.
The following key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations were uniformly applied to each CGU: Budgeted revenue and salary growth was based on the groups approved budgets and strategic plans between 2009 and 2011.
Budgeted margin between 2009 and 2011 was based on the average achieved margin in the 12 month period before the budget period uplifted for expected efficiency improvements which management believes are reasonably achievable.
Prior to 2011, growth rates in excess of 10% are assumed in the developing countries where the group operates.
This reflects the rate of growth historically in such countries and the significant potential for growth in the textile maintenance market.
Growth rates reflected within the cash flows after 2011 have been increased in line with historic GDP growth for the appropriate country in determining the appropriate terminal value multiple.
UK and Ireland Nordic Continent Revenue growth after 2011 2.3% 2.3% Up to 2.3% Salary growth after 2011 2.3% 2.3% Up to 2.3% Management are of the opinion that it does not currently foresee a change in the key assumptions it has employed when determining the value-in-use calculations would result in any impairment.
The German Healthcare division has undergone significant restructuring in the second half of 2008 and from 2009 will be managed as a separate business with its own management board.
An impairment review in accordance with the approach and assumptions outlined above has been carried out on the division and no impairment was recognised as the recoverable amount of goodwill and net assets exceeded its carrying value by 8%.
The key assumptions used for the value-in-use calculation are as follows: A small revenue decline from 2008 level is assumed in 2009 and 2010 and to remain flat thereafter.
As a result of the restructuring programmes implemented in 2008 and further efficiency improvement initiatives, operating margins have been assumed to grow from 2% in 2008 to double digit in the medium term in line with those previously achieved.
If the above assumptions are not achieved then impairment may become necessary.

The facility will expire on 23rd June 2012 in line with the existing 420 million revolving credit facility.
In 2006 the group issued private placement notes of US$250 million which were immediately swapped into a basket of Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros see note 17.
These are stated above at the year end exchange rates.
As underlying currencies have been swapped from US dollars via derivative contracts the group has a gain on financial instruments see note 17 which is offset by the currency translation loss on the underlying borrowing noted above.
The borrowing under the US private placement of 177.9 million reflects the US$250 million translated at the year end sterling to dollar rate and the impact of derivatives.

The four swaps entered into for this purpose have been designated as cash flow hedges.
On 19th January 2007, the group swapped a further notional principal of 55 million from floating to fixed rates and the two swaps entered into have been designated as cash flow hedges.
On 23rd January 2008, a notional principal amount of DKK 400 million was swapped from floating to fixed rates.
This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
On 16th September 2008, a further notional principal amount of SEK 300 million was swapped from floating to fixed rates.
The swap entered into has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
On 25th May 2006 the group undertook a private placement in the US for $250 million at fixed rates for periods between 812 years and the amount was immediately converted into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
The conversion into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros was achieved in two stages.
In the first stage six swaps were taken out to convert US dollars to sterling.
Five of these hedges have been designated as cash flow hedges and one as a fair value hedge.
In the second stage six further swaps were taken out to convert sterling to the required currencies.
These have been designated as hedges of net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The fixed interest rate cross currency contracts entered into have options exercisable by either party to terminate after five years and ten years if relevant.
The value of the swap at the time would then be cash settled.
These swaps all have a maturity of greater than 12 months.
74 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17 Derivative financial instruments continued During the year in accordance with group policy, the group entered into several forward foreign exchange contracts for the purchase of US dollars in the future at fixed rates.
These forward contracts reduce the foreign exchange exposure on the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
These derivatives are designated cash flow hedges.
The contracts all have a maturity of less than one year.
Cash flow hedges The interest rate swaps have resulted in the recognition of a derivative liability of 6.1 million.
At 31st December 2008 the fixed interest rates vary from 3.11% to 4.54%, the floating euro rate being EURIBOR, the floating Danish krone rate being CIBOR and the floating Swedish krona rate being STIBOR.
The blended rate for the group on this amount is 4.1%.
Of the $250 million private placement $200 million was swapped into fixed rates via sterling swaps.
The fixed rate on the US private placement which has been swapped varies from 5.56% to 5.66%.
The derivative asset recognised on these five instruments is 43.5 million.
The exchange component of this derivative movement has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 38.0 million profit.
The remaining 13.0 million profit has been taken to the hedging reserve.
The forward foreign exchange contracts have resulted in the recognition of a derivative asset of 1.1 million.
Net investment hedges The second stage of the US private placement swaps results in sterling being exchanged into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
At 31st December the fixed rate borrowings vary between rates of 4.26% and 4.63% on the fixed European swaps.
The floating Danish krone swap varies is on CIBOR.
These swaps are accounted for as hedges of the groups assets in the relevant countries.
The derivative liability arising of 43.3 million has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 37.5 million loss.
The groups borrowing under its revolving credit facility, designated as a hedge of its European operations.
The carrying value of the borrowings as at 31st December 2008 was 605.3 million 2007: 438.3 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 47.5 million on translation is in reserves as a component part of currency translation.
The swaps used in relation to this hedge have a maturity of between two and five years with no contractual re-pricing.
Fair value hedges $50 million of the US Private placement was swapped into a floating Danish krone 309.1 million, via a sterling swap.
The sterling swap is dealt with as a fair value hedge.
The ineffective portion of the fair value hedge resulted in a profit of 14,072 2007: 39,446.
The fair value hedge has resulted in the recognition of a 11.0 million derivative asset.
18 Financial risk management 18.1 Financial risk factors The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk: fair value interest rate risk: cash flow interest rate risk and price risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
The groups overall risk management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the group finance team under the supervision of the Finance Director under policies approved by the board of directors.
The Finance Director identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board approves written principles for foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk, and the use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and receives regular reports on such matters.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The majority of operations in the group bill their revenues and incur their costs in the same functional currency.
The group faces some currency exposure in respect of the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
The group policy is to enter forward contracts to purchase US dollars based upon the expected purchases.
These derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges.
75 18.1 Financial risk factors continued The groups policy is not to hedge foreign currency exposures on the translation of its overseas profit to sterling.
Where appropriate, borrowings are effectively arranged in currencies so as to provide a natural hedge against the investment in overseas net assets.
During 2008 and 2007, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows: As at 31st December 2008 Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone Swedish krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 29.9 20.5 32.5 19.2 4.3 106.4 Bank overdrafts 21.5 11.8 0.1 0.5 33.9 Net cash and cash equivalents note 14 29.9 1.0 20.7 19.1 3.8 72.5 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities 1.2 252.2 177.9 53.8 123.1 605.8 Finance lease liabilities 7.0 0.1 3.0 0.7 10.8 Pre-derivative position 24.1 253.2 177.9 33.2 107.0 3.1 544.1 Derivative effect 0.6 63.9 177.9 54.3 54.1 6.2 Net debt position 24.7 317.1 87.5 161.1 3.1 537.9 As at 31st December 2007 Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone Swedish krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 46.7 20.8 26.9 12.3 3.1 109.8 Bank overdrafts 0.4 9.9 17.1 0.2 27.6 Net cash and cash equivalents note 14 46.3 10.9 9.8 12.1 3.1 82.2 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities 1.1 160.2 126.1 69.3 84.2 438.7 Finance lease liabilities 7.5 0.1 2.7 0.3 10.6 Pre-derivative position 39.9 149.3 126.1 59.6 74.8 2.8 367.1 Derivative effect 46.7 126.1 41.9 49.6 12.1 Net debt position 39.9 196.0 101.5 124.4 2.8 379.2 The exposure to euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone largely relate to our net investment hedge activities as described and shown in note 17. ii Price risk The group is not exposed to any equity securities or commodities price risk.
iii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The groups interest bearing assets include cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at floating rates.
The groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain a majority of its borrowings at fixed rate using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary.
During 2008 and 2007, the groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
As at 31st December 2008, the group has the following swaps to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt: 205 million, DKK 400 million and SEK 300 million.
76 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 18.1 Financial risk factors continued The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual repricing date or maturity where there is no repricing, of fixed rate borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps: As at As at 31st December 31st December 2008 2007 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings In one year or less 3.9 3.9 In more than one year, but not more than two years 3.6 3.2 In more than two years but not more than five years 4.4 5.6 In more than five years 179.3 126.5 191.2 139.2 Floating interest rate borrowings 425.4 310.1 Total borrowings 616.6 449.3 During 2008 and 2007, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: As at 31st December 2008 As at 31st December 2007 Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 72.5 72.5 82.2 82.2 Borrowings 191.2 425.4 616.6 139.2 310.1 449.3 Pre-derivative position 191.2 352.9 544.1 139.2 227.9 367.1 Derivative effect note i 244.7 249.8 5.1 132.6 120.5 12.1 Net debt position 435.9 103.1 539.0 271.8 107.4 379.2 i Excludes the forward foreign exchange contract derivatives.
b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a group or local basis as appropriate.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across geographical areas.
If there is no independent rating, management assesses the credit quality of the customer taking into account, its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set based on internal ratings.
Management monitors the utilisation of credit limits regularly.
Management does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 13 trade receivables.
Management does not expect any losses from non-performance by the counterparties.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from use of derivative instruments.
As at 31st December 2008 and 31st December 2007, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under all financial assets including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial contracts were 272.1 million 2007: 238.3 million.
77 18.1 Financial risk factors continued c Liquidity risk We manage our liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom position which is used to demonstrate funding adequacy for periods of 1236 months.
The table below analyses the groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relative maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contract maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are contractual undiscounted cash flows using spot interest and foreign exchange rates at 31st December 2008.
Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of the discount is not significant.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone interest rates and sterling exchange rate on our financial instruments.
We have excluded from this analysis the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of trade receivables and payables, since these are not exposed to risk from the market variables.
This analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31st December 2008 and 31st December 2007.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: financial derivatives in net investment hedging relationship will not influence interest or foreign exchange sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is recorded fully within the income statement: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments from movements in exchange rates are recorded fully within equity.
78 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 18.1 Financial risk factors continued The following table shows the groups exposure to foreign exchange risk as at 31st December 2008 and 31st December 2007, which is a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of foreign currency denominated borrowings.
The foreign exchange risk is naturally hedged against the net assets of our operations in Continental Europe.
All foreign exchange on both the borrowings and net assets is taken to reserves where it will offset.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or take other steps to increase share capital or reduce debt.
The group manages its capital structure using a number of measures and taking into account its future strategic plans.
Such measures include its net interest cover and leverage ratios, which are included in its banking covenants.
The group continues to remain compliant with all its banking covenants.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.

Vacant properties Vacant property provisions are made in respect of vacant and partly sub-let leasehold properties to the extent that the future rental payments are expected to exceed future rental income.
It is further assumed, where reasonable, that the properties will be able to be sub-let beyond the present sub-let lease agreements.
In determining the vacant property provision, the cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using the appropriate government bond rates.
Restructuring Restructuring provisions comprise largely of employee termination payments.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Property disposals The group has outstanding warranties, indemnities and guarantees given previously on a number of properties operated by businesses which have been disposed.
The majority of these expire in 2017 with the remaining expiring by 2022.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are reinvested by the group or the timing of dividends is controlled by the parent, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

Shares in relation to the award will be released to participants at the end of a three-year performance period, dependent upon the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied.
The group uses the Monte-Carlo model to value the award.
For each award, the group established a comparator group of other companies from the FTSE Mid 250 Investment funds excluded.
The expected volatility under this model is based on the daily movement of total shareholder return over the three years prior to the grant.
The correlation figure shown is the average against all other companies movements in total shareholder return in the comparator group.
If a company leaves the comparator group it is removed from the performance criteria for vesting, although the remuneration committee can at their discretion replace it.
The dividend yield is set as zero as the value of dividends can only be awarded at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
The awards vest as follows: Performance of total shareholder return: % vesting Below median ranking 0 Median ranking 25 Upper quartile 100 Between median and upper quartile 25% to 100% pro-rata on a straight line basis The Deferred Bonus Share Plan DBSP awards are conditional on the employee completing two years service from the date of the grant.
The Executive Incentive Plan EIP awards are conditional on the employee achieving relevant, stretching three-year performance targets.
The DBSP and EIP have been valued using the Black-Scholes model.

Defined benefit plans Within the United Kingdom, the group principally operates a registered defined benefit scheme The Davis Service Group Retirement Benefits Scheme.
There was a triennial valuation in February 2007.
Overseas, the only significant pension arrangements are the defined benefit scheme operated in Ireland and unfunded schemes within Sweden, Germany and Norway.
Under such schemes the group discharges its pension obligations through schemes administered by insurance companies or government agencies.
The overall surplus on the funded plans is 2.0 million of which 6.9 million is in respect of the main UK plan.
There is a deficit of 25.5 million on unfunded plans.
Where a defined benefit scheme is administered by an insurance company with a collective of other companies and the insurance company is unable to assess the share of the groups pension obligation, the pension scheme has been accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
92 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Pension commitments continued The actuarial valuations of the principal scheme, together with eight other defined benefit schemes operated by the group have each been updated as at 31st December 2008 by qualified actuaries using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2008 2007 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.8 4.3 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.7 3.3 Discount rate 5.9 5.7 Inflation rate 2.7 3.2 Expected return on plan assets Equities 8.0 8.0 Bonds 5.1 5.6 Mortality rate Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice, published statistics and experience in each territory.

The objectives of the fund are to hold a diversified basket of assets which is pro-actively changed to avoid the risks of a static portfolio.
The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity and other investments reflect long-term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
