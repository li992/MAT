Share-based payments The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees in the Group.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant, and expensed over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Binomial model for share-based payments with internal performance criteria such as Earnings Per Share targets and a Monte Carlo model for those with external performance criteria such as Total Shareholder Return targets.
For schemes with internal performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet date, based on expectations of performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting.

For schemes with external performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of leavers prior to vesting.
Share-based payments issued by the Company to its subsidiary undertakings are treated as additions to investments based on the fair value of the grant, spread over the relevant vesting period, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
Where the Company recharges the cost of share-based payments to its subsidiary undertakings the investment is reduced accordingly.
