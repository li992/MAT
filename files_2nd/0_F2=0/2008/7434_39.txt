Acquisition of subsidiary During the period under review, the Group acquired the leases of seven stores from the administrator of Fopp, together with various trademarks and domain names.
Consideration of 0.4m was paid for the assets acquired and the book value is considered to be equal to the fair value.
On 3 July 2006 the Group acquired for cash the share capital of Ottakars plc.
Ottakars was a chain of book stores which operated from 141 stores in the UK at the date of acquisition.
The book value and fair value of the net assets acquired were as follows: Book value Fair value m m Property, plant and equipment 30.4 21.5 Inventories 27.6 24.0 Trade and other receivables 8.0 7.8 Trade and other payables 21.8 24.9 Taxation 0.6 2.6 Net debt 31.8 31.8 11.8 0.8 Goodwill arising on acquisition 71.0 Consideration satisfied by cash 70.2 Of the 70.2m consideration, 11.8m was paid in the 52 weeks ended 29 April 2006 when the Group acquired for cash approximately 10% of the share capital for 440p per share.
The remaining 90% of share capital was purchased at 285p per share.
As a result of the acquisition goodwill of 71.0m was capitalised see Note 16.
From the date of acquisition to 28 April 2007, Ottakars contributed 138.8m of revenue and made a profit before tax and exceptional items of 6.0m.
In addition, exceptional costs of 10.2m relating to the integration and 2.9m relating to store closures were charged in the prior year see Note 7.
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the prior year, revenue for the Group would have been 1,916.0m and profit before exceptional items would have been 44.7m.
The fair value of tax assets acquired includes deferred tax arising in the period ended 28 April 2007 from the last balance sheet date before acquisition 28 January 2006 to 3 July 2006 of 1.9m and deferred tax arising on other fair value adjustments of 1.3m.
Included in the 71.0m of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature.
These items include the expected value of synergies and an assembled workforce.
