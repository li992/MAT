Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
General information Inmarsat plc the Company or together with its subsidiaries, the Group is a company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The address of its registered ofce is 99 City Road, London, EC1Y 1AX, United Kingdom.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 6.
The Companys ticker symbol on the London Stock Exchange is ISAT LSE: ISAT.
Principal accounting policies Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 2007 the consolidated financial statements are set out below.
The text below describes how, in preparing the financial statements, the Directors have applied International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the assumptions and estimates they have made in applying the standards and interpretations and the policies adopted in the 2008 financial statements.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities as described later in these accounting policies.
The Directors acknowledge the latest guidance on going concern.
Despite the current volatility in financial markets and uncertain economic outlook, the Directors believe that the Group has a robust and resilient business model, strong free cash ow generation and is compliant with all covenants.
In making their assessment of going concern, the Directors considered recent budgets, the fifteen month rolling forecast, the cash ow forecast and the most recent Long Range Financial Plan.
In addition, the Directors considered the maturity prole of existing debt facilities, other liabilities as well as actual and forecast covenant calculations.
Furthermore, the forecasts and covenant calculations were stress tested by applying a set of downside scenarios.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, Inmarsat continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The Groups business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofcers Business Review and the Chief Financial Ofcers Review on pages 4 to 22.
The financial position of the Group, its cash ows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Ofcers Review on pages 13 to 22.
In addition, note 3 and 32 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Basis of accounting The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best estimate of the amount, event or actions, the actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 4.
Accounting policies adopted in preparing these consolidated financial statements have been selected in accordance with IFRS.
In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRIC 14, IAS19 The Limit on a Dened benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
IFRIC 14 provides guidance on the implications of pension scheme minimum funding requirements and the criteria under which reductions in future contributions should be regarded as available.
Adoption of IFRIC 14 has no impact on these consolidated financial statements.
On 1 January 2008, the Group adopted IAS 23 as revised, Borrowing Costs, in advance of its effective date, which is for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The impact of the adoption of IAS 23 as revised is the compulsory capitalisation of interest and finance costs associated with assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for intended use.
As a result, during 2008 US$0.9m of interest was capitalised 2007: US$nil see note 10.

Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its domestic and overseas subsidiary undertakings.
All intercompany transactions and balances with subsidiary undertakings have been eliminated on consolidation.
Subsidiary undertakings include all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The results of subsidiary undertakings established or acquired during the period are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of establishment or acquisition of control.
The results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the period are included until the date of disposal.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
On the acquisition of a company or business, fair values reecting conditions at the date of acquisition are attributed to the identiable separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
In respect of the CIP transaction described below and in note 24, the book values of the identiable separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired were deemed to represent their provisional fair value as the acquisition was accounted for on a provisional basis in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007.
The values of identiable separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities have been adjusted following a final fair value exercise conducted during the year.
Where the fair value of the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the identiable separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
Fees and similar incremental costs incurred directly in making an acquisition are included in the cost of the acquisition and capitalised.
Internal costs, and other expenses that cannot be directly attributed to the acquisition, are charged to the Income Statement.

The depreciation and amortisation charge has increased by US$0.1m to US$176.8m and the tax expense has increased by US$0.2m to US$28.4m, resulting in a US$0.3m decrease in consolidated profit for the year.
Total assets at 31 December 2007 have increased by US$61.9m to US$2,826.5m and total liabilities have increased by US$62.2m to US$2,093.1m, resulting in a decrease in net assets of US$0.3m see note 24.
Consolidation of CIP The consolidated results of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 2007 include the financial results of CIP UK Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries including Stratos Global Corporation together CIP 2007 includes the 21 day period from 11 December 2007 to 31 December 2007.
On 11 December 2007, CIP Canada Investment Inc CIP Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CIP UK Holdings Limited CIP UK, acquired the entire issued share capital of Stratos Global Corporation Stratos, our largest distribution partner, for a consideration of $294.0m Canadian dollars hedged value of US$263.3m.
On the same date, Inmarsat Finance III Limited Inmarsat III, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Inmarsat plc, provided a loan for the full consideration paid and associated fees to CIP UK to fund the acquisition Transaction by its wholly-owned subsidiary CIP Canada the Loan Facility.
On the same date, Communications Investment Partners Limited CIP Limited granted Inmarsat III an option to acquire the entire issued share capital of CIP UK the Call Option.
The Call Option is only exercisable after 14 April 2009, when certain of Inmarsats distribution agreements expire, and terminates on 31 December 2010.
The Call Option is exercisable for a payment of between US$750,000 and US$1.0m.
Following the acquisition of Stratos by CIP Canada, and until such time as a decision is made to exercise the Call Option, we have no control over the financial and operating policies of Stratos and it is expected to continue its current operations and business as usual.
Although Inmarsat does not hold an equity interest in, nor have any control over the financial and operating policies of, or any entitlement to receive dividends from CIP UK, under IFRS more specically Standing Interpretations Committee SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities SPE the Group is required to consolidate the financial results of CIP UK, as it meets the SIC12 IAS 27 denition of a SPE given that the Group is deemed to bear the risks and economic benets of CIP UK by virtue of the combination of the Loan Facility and the Call Option.
1 We have accounted for the combination of Inmarsat Core and CIP using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
Results of operations for CIP for the period 11 December 2007 to 31 December 2007 21 days of activity have been included in the Consolidated Income Statement of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2007.
The results for the year ended 31 December 2007 have been restated to reect the final fair value allocation of assets and liabilities.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of CIP are identied separately from the equity attributable to shareholders of Inmarsat plc.
Non-controlling interests primarily consist of the amount of those interests at the date of acquisition, which represents the maximum amount of US$1.0m payable by Inmarsat III on exercise of the Call Option.
This amount will not vary with the trading results of CIP.
Comparatives The Group previously classied US$1.0m of CIPs pension liabilities as current trade and other payables.
To conform to the treatment 1 of pension liabilities by Inmarsat Core, US$1.0m has been reclassied from current trade and other payables to non-current pension provisions in 2007.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency The functional currency of the Company and most of the Groups subsidiaries and the presentation currency of the Group is the US dollar, as the majority of operational transactions are denominated in US dollars.
The exchange rate between US dollars and Pounds Sterling as at 31 December 2008 was US$1.44 1.00 2007: US$1.99 1.00.
The average rate between US dollar and Pounds Sterling for 2008 was US$1.86 1.00 2007: US$2.00 1.00.

Differences on exchange arising on the settlement of the transactions denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency are recognised in the Income Statement.
Monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiary undertaking of the Group have been translated at the spot rates of exchange ruling at the end of each month.
Differences on exchange arising from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency are recognised in equity to the extent that the foreign exchange exposure is hedged while the remaining differences are recognised in the Income Statement.
Financial instruments and hedging activities Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument.
Non-derivative financial assets are classied as accounts receivable, short-term deposits or cash and cash equivalents.
They are stated at amortised cost using the effective-interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
For interest-bearing assets, their carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and bank time deposits, together with other short-term highly liquid investments.
In the Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts, which are included as current borrowings in liabilities on the Balance Sheet.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are all classied as other liabilities and stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
For borrowings, their carrying value includes accrued interest payable, as well as unamortised issue costs.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational and nancing activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the Income Statement except where the derivative is a designated cash ow hedging instrument.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is reperformed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Gains or losses on cash ow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Where the forecast transaction results in a financial asset or liability, gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassied to the Income Statement in the same period as the asset or liability impacts income.
If the forecasted transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure, gains or losses deferred in equity are transferred to the Income Statement in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure.
The ineffective portions of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the Income Statement when the committed or forecasted transaction is recognised in the Income Statement.
However, where the Group has applied cash ow hedge accounting for a forecasted or committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, then the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity is transferred to the Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement.
Revenue recognition Mobile satellite communications services revenue results from utilisation charges that are recognised as revenue over the period in which the services are provided.
Deferred income attributable to mobile satellite communications services or subscription fees represents the unearned balances remaining from amounts received from customers pursuant to prepaid contracts.
Mobile satellite communications services lease revenues are recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract concerned, which is typically between one and twelve months, unless another systematic basis is deemed more appropriate.
The Groups revenues are stated net of volume discounts which increase over the course of the financial year as specic revenue thresholds are achieved by distribution partners resulting in lower prices.
Revenue also includes income from services contracts, rental income, conference facilities and income from the sale of terminals and other communication equipment.
Revenue from service contracts, rental income and conference facilities is recognised as the service is provided.
Sales of terminals and other communication equipment are recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the purchaser.

pdf 28 27 3 09 17:09:06 27 3 09 17:09:06 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised against revenue when there is objective evidence that trade receivables are impaired.
Larger accounts are specically reviewed to assess a customers ability to make payments.
Employee benets Wages, salaries, social security contributions, accumulating annual leave, bonuses and non-monetary benets are accrued in the year in which the associated services are performed by the employees of the Group.
Termination benets are payable whenever an employees employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benets.
The Group recognises termination benets when it has demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of current employees or to provide termination benets, as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
The Group recognises liabilities relating to dened benefit pension plans and post-retirement healthcare benets in respect of employees in the UK and overseas.
The Groups net obligations in respect of dened benefit pension plans and post-retirement healthcare benets are calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The calculation is performed by a qualied actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the present value of the dened benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are immediately recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The Group operates a number of dened contribution pension schemes in its principal locations.
Pension costs for the dened contribution schemes are charged to the Income Statement when the related employee service is rendered.
The Group issues equity-settled share options and awards to employees.
Equity settled share option awards are measured at fair value at the date of the grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary deductible differences or tax loss carry forwards can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Research and development Research expenditure is expensed when incurred.
Development expenditure is expensed when incurred unless it meets criteria for capitalisation.
Development costs are only capitalised once a business case has been demonstrated as to the technical feasibility and commercial viability.
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life.

pdf 29 27 3 09 17:09:06 27 3 09 17:09:06 2008 Operations Governance Financial Statements Property, plant and equipment Space segment assets Space segment assets comprise satellite construction, launch and other associated costs.
Expenditure charged to space segment projects includes invoiced progress payments, amounts accrued appropriate to the stage of completion of contract milestone payments, external consultancy costs and direct internal costs.
Internal costs, comprising primarily staff costs, are only capitalised when they are directly attributable to the construction of an asset.
Progress payments are determined on milestones achieved to date together with agreed cost escalation indices.
Deferred satellite payments represent the net present value of future payments dependent on the future performance of each satellite and are recognised in space segment assets when the satellite becomes operational.
The associated liability is stated at its net present value and included within liabilities.
These space segment assets are depreciated over the life of the satellites from the date they become operational and are placed into service.
As of 1 January 2008, on adoption of IAS 23 as revised, Borrowing Costs, borrowing costs attributable to the construction of assets which take a substantial period of time to get ready for intended use qualifying assets are added to the costs of those assets.
Prior to 1 January 2008 borrowing costs for the construction of assets were not capitalised.
Assets in course of construction Assets in course of construction relate to the Inmarsat-4 F3 satellite and BGAN services.
These assets will be transferred to space segment assets and depreciated over the life of the satellites once they become operational and placed into service.
No depreciation has been charged on these assets.
Other xed assets Other xed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write off the historical cost less residual values, if any, of xed assets, except land, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
The Group selects its depreciation rates and residual values carefully and reviews them annually to take account of any changes in circumstances.
When setting useful economic lives, the principal factors the Group takes into account are the expected rate of technological developments, expected market requirements for the equipment and the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used.
The lives assigned to significant tangible xed assets are: Space segment 515 years Fixtures and ttings, and services related equipment 520 years Buildings 2050 years Other xed assets 35 years Asset retirement obligations The fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible property, plant and equipment is recognised in the financial statements in the period in which the liability is incurred.
Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, a corresponding asset retirement cost is added to the carrying amount of the related asset, which is subsequently amortised to income over the remaining useful life of the asset.
Following the initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the carrying amount of the liability is increased for the passage of time by applying an interest method of allocation to the liability with a corresponding accretion cost reected in operating expenses.
Revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash ows are recognised each period as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset retirement obligation and the related property, plant and equipment.
Government grants Government grants have been received in relation to the purchase and construction of certain assets.
Government grants are deducted from the cost of the relevant assets to arrive at carrying amount.
The grants are therefore recognised as income over the lives of the assets by way of a reduced depreciation charge.
Gains and losses on disposals of tangible and intangible assets Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing net proceeds with the carrying amount.
These are included in the Income Statement.
Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill, patents, trademarks, software, terminal development costs, spectrum rights, customer relationships and intellectual property.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a nite useful life are reviewed each financial year.

pdf 30 27 3 09 17:09:06 27 3 09 17:09:06 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid on the acquisition over the fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
b Patents and trademarks Patents and trademarks are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which are 7 years and between 10 and 20 years respectively.
c Software development costs Development costs directly relating to the development of new services are capitalised as intangible assets.
Costs are capitalised once a business case has been demonstrated as to technical feasibility and commercial viability.
Such costs are amortised over the estimated sales life of the services.
d Terminal development costs The Group capitalises development costs associated with the development of user terminals.
For R-BGAN and BGAN services terminal development costs are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which is between 5 and 10 years.
e Spectrum rights Spectrum rights are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method.
Spectrum rights acquired as a result of the ACeS collaboration in September 2006 are amortised over a remaining useful life of 6.3 years.
Spectrum rights acquired as a result of the CIP transaction are amortised over their useful lives of 3 to 10 years.
f Customer relationships Customer relationships acquired in connection with the acquisition of CIP are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and are being amortised over the expected period of benefit of 12 years using the straight-line method.
g Intellectual property Intellectual property is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation was calculated using the straight-line method over a remaining useful life of 0.3 years.
Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
The impairment review comprises a comparison of the carrying amount of the xed asset or goodwill with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Fair value less costs to sell is calculated by reference to the amount at which the asset could be disposed of.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected future cash ows obtainable as a result of the assets continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market-based discount rate on a pre-tax basis.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The carrying amount will only be increased where an impairment loss recognised in a previous period for an asset other than goodwill either no longer exists or has decreased, up to the amount that it would have been had the original impairment not occurred.
Any impairment to goodwill recognised in a previous period is not reversed.
For the purpose of conducting impairment reviews, cash generating units are identied as groups of assets, liabilities and associated goodwill that generate cash ows that are largely independent of other cash ow streams.
The assets and liabilities include those directly involved in generating the cash ows and an appropriate proportion of corporate assets.
For the purposes of impairment review space segment assets are treated as one cash generating unit.
Leases Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classied as operating leases by the lessee.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Interest and finance costs Interest is recognised in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Transaction and arrangement costs of borrowings are capitalised as part of the carrying amount of the borrowings and amortised over the life of the debt.

Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined by the average cost method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents, measured at fair value, includes cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings as current liabilities on the Balance Sheet.
Provisions Provisions, other than in respect of pension and post-retirement healthcare benets, are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic benets arising from past events and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are not recognised unless the outow of economic benets to settle the obligation is more likely than not to occur.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised as proceeds received, net of transaction and arrangement costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Transaction and arrangement costs of borrowings and the difference between the proceeds and the redemption value are recognised in the Income Statement over the life of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.
Convertible Bonds Convertible bonds that can be converted into share capital at the option of the holder are considered and accounted for as compound financial instruments, consisting of a separate liability component and an equity component in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for a similar non-convertible debt instrument.
The embedded call and put options, since they are closely linked to the underlying instrument, are valued and recognised as part of the liability.
The total liability is recognised as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bond.
The equity component initially brought to account is determined by deducting the amount of the liability component from the fair value of the compound instrument as a whole and represents the option for the holder to convert the bond into equity of the company.
This conversion option is recognised and included directly in equity and is not subsequently remeasured.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components based on their respective carrying amounts at the date of issue.
On conversion, the liability is reclassied to equity and no gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss.
Where the convertible borrowing is redeemed early or repurchased in a way that does not alter the original conversion privileges, the consideration paid is allocated to the liability and equity components.
The consideration relating to the equity component is recognised in equity and the amount of gain or loss relating to the liability element is recognised in the profit or loss.

Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups operations and significant debt nancing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in 1 debt market prices, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates.
Inmarsat Core has in place a risk 1 management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of Inmarsat Core by using forward exchange contracts to limit exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of uctuating interest rates on its oating rate long-term debt.

pdf 32 27 3 09 17:09:06 27 3 09 17:09:06 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The Board of Directors has delegated to a sub-committee, the Treasury Review Committee, the responsibility for setting the risk 1 management policies applied by Inmarsat Core.
The policies are implemented by the treasury department which receives regular reports from the operating companies to enable prompt identication of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The treasury department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specic guidelines for managing foreign exchange 1 risk, interest rate risk and credit risk see note 32.
The management of Inmarsat Core does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
1 The financial risks faced by CIP are substantially the same as those faced by Inmarsat Core and are managed separately by the 1 management of CIP which operates independently from Inmarsat Core.
Derivative financial instruments entered into by CIP to mitigate earnings volatility are subject to standard credit terms and conditions, financial controls, and risk monitoring procedures.
The management of CIP does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The functional currency of Inmarsat plc is US dollars.
The Group generates substantially all of its revenue in US dollars.
The 1 vast majority of capital expenditure is denominated in US dollars.
Approximately 60% of Inmarsat Cores operating costs are denominated in Sterling.
This exposure therefore needs to be carefully managed to avoid variability in future cash ows and earnings 1 caused by volatile foreign exchange rates.
As a guide Inmarsat Cores Sterling operating cost base for 2008 has been relatively constant at approximately 5.0m per month.
1 The foreign currency hedging policy of Inmarsat Core is to economically hedge a minimum of 50% of anticipated Sterling denominated operating expenses for the next 12 months and up to a maximum of 100% for the next three years on a rolling basis.
Excluding the impact of CIP, as at 31 December 2008 it is estimated that: A hypothetical 1% ination of the hedged US dollar Sterling exchange rate would have impacted the 2008 profit before tax by approximately US$1.3m 2007: US$1.2m.
A hypothetical 1% ination of the US dollar Sterling foreign currency spot rate at 31 December 2008, would have reduced the 2008 profit before tax by approximately US$0.1m 2007: increased by US$0.1m, primarily as a result of the translation of Sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
This analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts the translation of these items at the period end for a 1% change in foreign currency rates.
A hypothetical 1% ination in the US dollar Sterling and a 1% deation in the US dollar Euro foreign currency spot rates at 31 December 2008, would have impacted equity by US$1.3m and US$1.5m, respectively 2007: US$1.3m and US$nil, respectively primarily as a result of the changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash ow hedges.
Management believes that a 1% sensitivity rate provides a reasonable basis upon which to assess expected changes in foreign exchange rates.
CIP has long-term borrowings that are denominated primarily in US dollars, as disclosed in note 20, which is therefore not subject to risks associated with uctuating foreign currency rates of exchange.
CIPs reporting and functional currency is US dollars.
CIP operates internationally and is exposed to market risks related to foreign currency exchange rate uctuations.
ii Price risk The Group is not exposed to significant equity securities price risk or commodity price risk.
b Interest rate risk Given the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, income and operating cash ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
Interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
1 The policy of Inmarsat Core is to ensure certainty of the interest charge by xing interest rates on 60 100% of forecast net debt for the next two years on a rolling basis.
The Senior Notes, the Senior Discount Notes and the Convertible Bonds are at xed rates.
1 The management of CIP, which operates independently of Inmarsat Core, maintain their own policies regarding the hedging of interest rates.
The Group manages its cash ow interest rate risk by using oating-to-xed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from oating rates to xed rates.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specic intervals primarily quarterly, the difference between xed contract rates and oating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.

pdf 33 27 3 09 17:09:06 27 3 09 17:09:06 2008 Operations Governance Financial Statements As at 31 December 2008, if interest rates on borrowings changed by 1%, with all other variables held constant, the Groups profit after tax for the year would have been impacted by US$1.6m 2007: US$1.4m.
This is primarily due to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For oating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at each balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
Management believes that a 1% sensitivity rate provides a reasonable basis upon which to assess expected changes in interest rates.
c Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, shortterm deposits, trade receivables and derivative financial instruments.
The credit risk on liquid funds cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are highly rated financial institutions.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is: US$ in millions Note 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents 17 156.4 115.0 Trade receivables 18 175.8 163.8 Derivative financial instruments 32 9.7 0.5 Total credit risk 341.9 279.3 1 For Inmarsat Core, the average credit period on sales of services is 77 days 2007: 80 days.
No interest is charged on trade receivables until the receivables become overdue for payment.
Thereafter, interest is charged at a weighted average of 14% per 1 annum 2007: 16% per annum on the outstanding balance.
Inmarsat Core provides for receivables on a specic trade receivable 1 basis.
As at 31 December 2008 Inmarsat Core had not provided for any specic trade receivables 2007: US$nil.
1 For 2008, two 2007: two distribution partners comprised approximately 80.8% 2007: 82.1% of Inmarsat Core s revenues.
These 1 same two customers comprised 80.7% 2007: 84.8% of Inmarsat Core s trade receivables balance as at 31 December 2008.
One of these distribution partners is Stratos.
1 CIPs credit risk is managed separately by their management which operates independently from Inmarsat Core.
CIP is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to its derivative financial instruments.
Non-performance is not anticipated since these counterparties are highly rated financial institutions.
CIP is also exposed to credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from customers.
CIP provides services to many customers across different geographic areas.
No customer accounted for more than 10% or more of accounts receivable as at 31 December 2008.
CIP has credit evaluation, approval and monitoring processes intended to mitigate potential credit risks, and maintains provisions for potential credit losses that are assessed on an ongoing basis.
The allowance for uncollectability of trade receivables and revenue adjustments as at 31 December 2008 for CIP was US$13.9m 2007: US$14.6m.
The following table sets out the Groups trade receivable balance by maturity: US$ in millions Note 2008 2007 Current 150.8 140.0 Between 1 and 30 days overdue 16.4 16.4 Between 31 and 120 days overdue 7.1 7.4 Over 120 days overdue 1.5 Total trade receivables 18 175.8 163.8 1 61 Inmarsat plc Annual report and accounts 2008 Inmarsat plc and its subsidiaries excluding CIP 5354 Inmarsat 08 28-96 DR00 REV.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and short-term deposits and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
1 Inmarsat Core manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity proles of financial assets and liabilities.
Inmarsat 1 1 Core maintains a long-term Revolving Credit Facility of US$300.0m that is designed to ensure Inmarsat Core has sufficient available funds for operations.
Drawings on this facility were US$140.0m as at 31 December 2008 2007: US$70.0m.
1 CIP which is managed and operates independently from Inmarsat Core manages liquidity risk with a US$25.0m Revolving Operating Facility which was undrawn as at 31 December 2008 and 2007.
The facility is designed to ensure that CIP has sufficient available funds for operations.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The more significant estimates are discussed below: a Estimated impairment of goodwill The Group annually undertakes tests to determine whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.
The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets are given in note 15.
For the purpose of testing for impairment, goodwill is specically allocated to CGUs.
Four CGUs have been identied, being 1 Inmarsat Core Mobile Satellite Services MSS and Other, CIP Stratos Mobile Satellite Services Stratos MSS and Broadband.
It has been determined that goodwill that arose on the acquisition of Inmarsat Ventures Limited represented goodwill of the MSS CGU only.
Goodwill that arose on the acquisition of CIP has been allocated to the Stratos MSS and Broadband CGUs following the nalisation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities during the year see note 24.
Therefore, goodwill has been tested for impairment on the MSS, Stratos MSS and Broadband CGUs only.
Goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying amount of the CGU with its value in use.
The value in use calculation utilises an estimate of the future cash ows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
The key assumptions used in calculating the value in use are as follows: 1 discount rate the pre-tax rate used to discount the operating profit projections in respect of Inmarsat Core and CIP were 10.5% and 10.5% respectively: operating profit projections are derived from recently approved 5 year forecasts and have assumed terminal growth rates for 1 Inmarsat Core and CIP of 3.0% and 3.0% respectively.
Using the value in use as a measure, no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill was recognised.
In the opinion of the Directors, there have been no changes in the business strategy that would result in the carrying value of goodwill exceeding its recoverable amount.
For the Broadband segment the discount rate would need to increase to 11.23%, before the carrying value would exceed the value in use and result in an impairment charge being recognised in the Income Statement.
b Pension arrangements and post-retirement healthcare benets assumptions 1 Inmarsat Core has applied a rate of return on assets of 7.77% p. a.
2007: 7.40% p. a. which represents the expected return on asset holdings in the future.
The discount rate used to calculate the pension and post-retirement healthcare benets liabilities was 6.10% 2007: 5.80% see note 30. c Income tax The Groups income tax balance is the sum of the total current and deferred tax balances.
The calculation of this, and of the Groups potential liabilities or assets, necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be nally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority, or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
Issues can, and often do, take a number of years to resolve.
The amounts recognised or disclosed are derived from the Groups best estimation and judgement.
However, the inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of these means eventual realisation could differ from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Groups results and cash ows.

b US$550.0m Senior Credit Facility, led by Barclays Capital, ING Bank N. V. and the Royal Bank of Scotland plc with Inmarsat Investments Limited, is for general corporate purposes.
The US$550.0m five-year Senior Credit Facility consists of a US$250.0m amortising term loan and a US$300.0m revolving credit facility.
US$50.0m of the term loan is repayable in 2009, with the balance payable at maturity in May 2010.
The revolving credit facility, whilst included in current borrowing, is repayable at the latest at maturity of Senior Credit Facility in May 2010.
The term loan and drawings under the revolving credit facility were initially priced at 120 basis points above LIBOR and thereafter tied to a leverage grid.
Drawings on the US$300.0m revolving credit facility at 31 December 2008 were US$140.0m 2007: US$70.0m.
1 At 31 December 2008, Inmarsat Core had in place 3 interest rate swap agreements each of $100m to exchange LIBOR oating interest rates on US$300.0m of its Senior Credit Facility.
LIBOR oating rates of 1.96% are exchanged for xed rates of 4.978%, 4.496% and 4.907% on notional amounts of US$100.0m, US$100.0m and US$100.0m, respectively Note 32. c The 7.625% Senior Notes were issued by Inmarsat Finance plc, a 100% owned subsidiary of Inmarsat Group Limited.
The Senior Notes mature on 30 June 2012.
Interest is payable semi-annually in February and August.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had purchased US$146.7m 2007: US$91.6m of the aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding US$310.4m.
During 2008 Inmarsat Investments Limited purchased US$55.1m 2007: US$38.0m of the Senior Notes for US$55.8m 2007: US$40.7m.
Inmarsat Investments Limited paid a premium of US$0.6m 2007: US$1.3m and prepaid interest of US$0.1m 2007: US$1.4m which was later received back from the trustee Bank of New York.
Taking into account the Groups short-term cash surplus, the total payment of US$55.8m 2007: US$40.7m results in an overall economic benefit to the Group when the premium paid is compared to future net interest charges discounted back to values at that date.
d In November 2004, Inmarsat Finance II plc, a 100% owned subsidiary of Inmarsat Holdings Limited, issued a US$450.0m face value 10.375% Senior Discount Note at a price of 66.894% and thus received proceeds of US$301.0m.
The Notes accrete semi-annually in May and November until November 2008: thereafter interest is cash paid semi-annually.
The Notes mature on 15 November 2012. e On 16 November 2007, US$287.7m in principal amount of 1.75% convertible bonds due 2017 the Bonds were issued.
The Bonds are convertible into ordinary shares of the Company and have a 1.75% per annum coupon payable semi-annually and a yield to maturity of 4.50%.
The Bonds have an initial conversion premium of 32.5% over the reference share price of 4.6193 representing approximately 5% of the Companys current issued share capital.
The initial conversion price is US$12.694 and the total number of common shares to be issued if all Bonds are converted is 22.7 million shares.
The Company will have an option to call the Bonds after 7 years at their accreted principal amount under certain circumstances.
In addition, the holder of each Bond will have the right to require the Issuer to redeem such Bond at its accreted principal amount at years 5 and 7.

The equity component represents the fair value of the option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, as follows: US$ in millions Fair value of convertible bonds issued 287.7 Cost of issue 6.5 Net proceeds 281.2 1 Equity component 56.9 2 Liability component at date of issue 224.3 Interest charged 2.6 Coupon interest accrued 0.6 Liability component at 31 December 2007 226.3 Interest charged 22.1 Amortisation of debt issue costs 0.7 Coupon interest accrued 5.0 Liability component at 31 December 2008 244.1 1 Net of capitalised issue costs of US$1.3m.
2 Net of capitalised issue costs of US$5.2m.
The interest charged for the year is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 9.88% to the liability component.
The total interest charge is split between the coupon interest charge of US$5.0m 2007: US$0.6m and accreted interest of US$17.1m 2007: US$2.0m.
The coupon interest is paid semi annually in May and November each year until maturity.
Similarly, the bonds accrete semi-annually in May and November each year until maturity.
f On 13 February 2006, CIPs subsidiary, Stratos, entered into a credit agreement.
The Senior Credit Facilities consist of a five year US$25.0m Revolving Operating Facility and a six year Term B Facility of US$225.0m.
The Term B Facility is repayable in annual principal payments of US$2.3m with the balance due at maturity in February 2012 and bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which is currently 250 basis points per annum 2007: 275 based on Stratos leverage ratio.
An improvement in the ratio to beyond 3.5:1 resulted in a reduction of the margin rate to 250 basis points, as dened by the credit agreement.
The applicable LIBOR rate at 31 December 2008 was 1.46% 2007: 4.83%.
In addition to scheduled repayments, if leverage ratios exceed certain thresholds, specified proceeds from new debt and equity issuances as well as a stated percentage of excess cash ows, as dened in the credit agreement, are to be applied to the indebtedness outstanding under the facilities.
At 31 December 2008, CIPs subsidiary, Stratos had in place interest rate swap agreements to exchange LIBOR oating interest rates on US$75.0m of its Term B Facility 2007: US$200.0m.
The LIBOR oating rate of 3.96% 2007: 4.83% was exchanged for a xed rate of 3.95% on a notional amount of US$75.0m 2007: 3.95%, 4.28% and 5.18% on notional amounts of US$75.0m, US$50.0m and US$75.0m, respectively Note 32.
The Revolving Operating Facility has a term of five years and matures in February 2011.
The Revolving Operating Facility is available to Stratos in Canadian or US dollars and bears interest at varying base rates plus 100 225 basis points per annum, based on Stratos leverage ratio as set out in the credit agreement.
As at 31 December 2008 and 2007, no amounts were drawn on the Revolving Operating Facility.
If any amounts had been drawn on the Revolving Operating Facility, as at 31 December 2008, the applicable interest rate would have been LIBOR plus 185 basis points 2007: LIBOR plus 185 basis points.
The US$25.0m Revolving Operating Facility at 31 December 2008 is subject to an annual commitment fee of 40 basis points 2007: 40 basis points.
This rate is subject to change based on Stratos leverage ratio as set out in the credit agreement.
g Stratos Mortgage Obligation bears interest at a rate of 7.03% per annum, is repayable in blended monthly instalments of $15.0 thousand Canadian dollars, matures in April 2011, is amortised over a 10 year period, and is collateralised by land and a building owned by Stratos.
The Mortgage Obligation is denominated in Canadian dollars.
The Canadian dollar equivalent was $0.4m at 31 December 2008 2007: $0.6m.
h Stratos Senior Unsecured Notes were issued in February 2006.
The notes are due at maturity on 15 February 2013 and bear interest at a rate of 9.875% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on 15 February and 15 August each year.
During 2008, Inmarsat Finance III Limited Inmarsat III purchased US$57.7m of the aggregate principal amount of the notes.
Inmarsat III received a discount of US$2.9m and paid prepaid interest of US$1.3m which was later received back from the trustee Bank of New York.
Taking into account the Groups short-term cash surplus, the total payment of US$56.1m results in an overall economic benefit to the Group when the premium paid is compared to future net interest charges discounted back to values at that date.
At any time before 15 February 2009, Stratos had an option to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes within 60 days of an equity offering, with the net proceeds of such offering, at a redemption price of 109.875% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, provided that immediately after giving effect to such redemption, at least 65% of the original principal amount of the notes remain outstanding.
Stratos did not exercise this option.
On 11 December 2007, CIP Canada acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Stratos.
Under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, Stratos was required to make a mandatory offer to note holders to repurchase all notes at a purchase price in cash equal to not less than 101% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.
The mandatory tender period closed on 14 January 2008 and at that time only US$1,000 of notes had been tendered.
Prior to the expiration date, US$1,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes was validly tendered.
CIP Canada purchased all of these tendered Notes and they will be held in trust by an independent trustee for the benefit of CIP Canada.
As collateral for Stratos Revolving Operating Facility and Stratos Term B Facility discussed in f above, Stratos has provided a first priority perfected security interest over all of the assets of Stratos and its subsidiaries, with the exception of Plenexis Gesellschaft Fur Satelliten Kommunikation mBH and its subsidiaries, Stratos Communications Australia Pty Limited and Stratos Global Japan KK.
Concurrent with the acquisition of Xantic B. V. Xantic, Stratos supplemented the collateral securing the credit facilities with a first priority perfected security interest on its equity interest in Xantic.
As additional security, all of the subsidiaries of Stratos other than Plenexis and its subsidiaries, Xantic and its subsidiaries, Stratos Communications Australia Pty Limited and Stratos Global Japan KK, have guaranteed obligations under the senior credit facilities.

1 The Group has accounted for the combination of Inmarsat Core and CIP using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Results of operations for CIP have been included in the Consolidated Income Statement for the Group for the full year ended 31 December 2008 and the 21 day period 11 December 2007 to 31 December 2007.
For the year ended 31 December 2007 the purchase price was allocated to the assets and liabilities on a provisional basis.
No fair value adjustments were made to the book values of assets and liabilities under that provisional basis.
The allocation of the purchase consideration was nalised during 2008.
As a result of this review, goodwill decreased by US$136.0m.
The decrease reects the recognition of identiable intangible assets of US$197.7m, an uplift to tangible assets of US$1.0m, a corresponding deferred tax liability of US$59.6m and additional capitalised costs of US$3.1m.

b The value of property, plant and equipment has been increased to reect their depreciated replacement costs.
c US$1.0m of CIPs pension liabilities has been reclassied from trade and other payables to pension provisions.
d The adjustment to deferred income tax liabilities reects the deferred tax arising as a result of the fair value adjustments discussed above.
e Goodwill comprises the difference between the purchase consideration and the provisional fair value of the net assets acquired.
f The consideration represents the loan funding provided by Inmarsat III converted from Canadian dollars to US dollars at the date of transfer.
The loan is denominated in US dollars, as per the loan agreement.
The Group used forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against currency risk as at the date of the agreement and has elected to present the gains made on the foreign exchange contracts as a basis adjustment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill.
g An increase in directly attributable costs is as a result of the completion of the Transaction and nalisation of the associated costs.
h Non-controlling interests represent the amount payable by Inmarsat III to exercise the option to acquire 100% of the share capital of CIP UK and a minority interest in a subsidiary of CIP.

Employee share options and awards In November 2004, the Company adopted the Staff Value Participation Plan the 2004 Plan.
219,020 A ordinary shares were granted under the 2004 Plan to eligible Directors or employees of the Group.
A second grant of options over 7,140 A ordinary shares was made under the 2004 Plan to employees in January 2005.
As part of the IPO, the A ordinary shares were converted following a 1 for 20 share split into ordinary shares.
A third grant of options over 1,175,240 ordinary shares of c0.0005 each was approved in May 2005 under the 2004 Plan and granted to employees in June 2005.
Both subsequent grants were made on equivalent terms to the initial grant in November 2004.
All options granted under the 2004 Plan and held by optionholders have now vested and are exercisable.
Whenever options are exercised under the 2004 Plan, the holder must pay a fide minimis charge of c1 for each tranche of options exercised.
The options expire 10 years from the date of grant.
Following the exercise of options granted under the 2004 Plan, shares are transferred to the optionholders from the Inmarsat Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust the Trust resident in Guernsey.
No new shares have been issued to satisfy the exercise of these options.

In line with IFRS 2, Share-Based Payment, the Company recognised US$9.4m and US$5.2m respectively in total share compensation costs across all its share plans for the 2008 and 2007 financial years.
Total share-based compensation costs are recognised over the vesting period of the options and share awards ranging from one to four years.
Prior to the Company being publicly quoted, the exercise price of the options over the A ordinary shares of the Company issued under the 2004 Plan was fide minimis in nature and post the IPO remains fide minimis in nature, accordingly the fair value of each option is equivalent to the fair value of the underlying share at the date of the grant.
This fair value of US$12.50 per share before any adjustment for the share split in June 2005 was estimated with the assistance of independent advisers, who calculated a range of potential values using analysis of comparable quoted shares, discounted cash ows and comparable transactions.
The fair value within this range was then selected by the Directors using the independent analysis which had been prepared.
For the options granted under the 2004 Plan in June 2005 before the share split, the fair value was estimated by the Directors to be US$30.00 per share.
The US$30.00 was calculated using a similar methodology to the independent advisers as the Directors of the Company continued to believe that the discounted trading multiple approach was the most appropriate.
The Company also operates a Bonus Share Plan BSP.
The following awards under the BSP have been made to the Executive Directors and certain members of senior management: during 2006, awards of shares were made relating to a monetary award determined in May 2005 and September 2005.
These awards vested in three equal tranches following the announcement of the Preliminary Results for each of the financial years 2006, 2007 and 2008: during 2008, awards of shares were made relating to a monetary award determined in March, May and September 2007.
These awards vested and will vest subject to continued employment in three equal tranches following the announcement of the Preliminary Results for each of the financial years 2008, 2009 and 2010: and during 2009, awards of shares will be made relating to a monetary award determined in March 2008.
These awards will vest in three equal tranches following the announcement of the Preliminary Results for each of the financial years 2010, 2011 and 2012.
Awards are made in the form of a conditional allocation of shares.
The performance conditions attached to the BSP are non-market based performance conditions.
Dividends will accrue and be added as additional shares upon vesting.
Details of the operation of the BSP can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The rules of the BSP provide that the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to satisfy the awards using cash instead of shares.
It is the intention, however, of the Company to satisfy the awards using newly-issued shares.
As the BSP provides free share awards with no market based performance conditions attached, and which carry an entitlement to dividends paid in cash or shares during the vesting period, the fair value of the awards is the value of the grant.
This is due to the fact that regardless of the market price at the time the award of shares is made, the total value of shares to be awarded will not change.

pdf 52 27 3 09 17:09:08 27 3 09 17:09:08 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued The Company also operates a Performance Share Plan PSP under which the first share award was made on 31 May 2005 in the form of a conditional allocation of shares.
The number of shares subject to the share award was determined by reference to the price at which the shares were offered for sale upon the listing of the Company on the London Stock Exchange in June 2005 of 2.45 per share.
Participants are entitled to receive the value of any dividends that are paid during the vesting period in the form of cash or additional shares.
In March 2008, 100% of these shares vested.
Additional share awards were made in September 2005, March 2007 and March 2008 with the reference price in determining the number of shares of 3.24, 3.95 and 4.39 respectively market value of shares on the date of grant.
The PSP shares will not normally be transferred to participants until the third anniversary of the award date.
The transfer of shares is dependent upon the performance conditions being satisfied over the three consecutive financial years starting in the financial year the award date falls.
The rules of the PSP provide that the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to satisfy the awards using cash instead of shares.
It is the intention, however, of the Company to satisfy the awards using newly-issued shares at the end of the relevant three year period unless a participant leaves and is entitled under the Rules to receive a proportionate award and the performance condition has been met.
Details of the operation of the PSP can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The performance conditions for the PSP is based on the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to constituents of the FTSE 350 Index excluding investment trusts and a non-market based condition, based on EBITDA measured over a three year period.
The vesting schedule for PSP awards is structured so that the shape of the vesting schedule is determined by both TSR and EBITDA performance.
The market based performance condition has been incorporated into the valuation.
The fair value of the allocation and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: Performance Share Plan CEO Award 31 May 29 September 29 March 19 March 28 September Grant date 2005 2005 2007 2008 2007 Grant price 2.45 3.24 3.95 4.39 4.49 Exercise price nil nil nil nil nil Bad leaver rate 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Vesting period 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected correlation between any pair of shares in PSP comparator group 12% 10% n a n a n a Volatility 36% 34% 27% 28.5% 28% Fair value per share option 1.34 2.20 2.15 2.40 2.65 Both the BSP and PSP share awards expire 10 years after date of grant.
The weighted average of the remaining contractual life for both the BSP and PSP share awards at 31 December 2008 is 8.5 and 7.3 years respectively.
Following the announcement on 28 September 2007 that Andrew Sukawaty has agreed to remain in the joint role of Chairman and Chief Executive officer for a further period, expected to be not less than two years, the Remuneration Committee made him an exceptional award of one million incentive shares conditional upon the delivery of significant share price growth.
The mid-market closing share price on 27 September 2007 was 4.49 per share.
No shares will be earned unless, three years after grant, the share price reaches a minimum price of 5.50.
For performance above this level, shares will be earned pro rata up to a share price of 7.25 at which the full award will be earned.
A further award over 700,000 shares could be earned if, at the time that performance is assessed, the share price has reached 9.25.
If the share price is below 7.25, none of the additional shares would be earned and if between 7.25 and 9.25, shares would be earned pro rata up to a share price of 9.25.
The share price performance condition will be assessed on the basis of the average closing price of Inmarsat shares over the last 20 trading days of the performance period.
Additional shares will accrue representing the value of dividends paid during the performance period on the number of shares that ultimately vest.
The Remuneration Committee anticipates that if an award of shares is made to Mr Sukawaty, then the share price performance will have out-performed the FTSE 350 Index excluding investment trusts.
However, in the event that this is not the case, the Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to scale back the award of shares by up to 50% of the proposed share award.
The Trust purchased one million shares on 26 November 2007 to hold against the satisfaction of the award.
This has been funded through a loan from Inmarsat plc to the Trust.
The Company also operates a UK Sharesave Scheme.
The Sharesave Scheme is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme open to all UK PAYE-paying permanent employees.
The maximum that can be saved each month by an employee is 250 and savings plus interest may be used to acquire shares by exercising the related option at the end of the three-year savings contract.
Options are exercisable for a period of up to six months following the end of the three year savings contract and under certain circumstances if an employee leaves the Inmarsat group.
No dividends are accumulated on options during the vesting period.
Newly issued shares will be used to satisfy the options.

The first grant matured on 1 September 2008.
A second grant under the Sharesave Scheme was made in December 2008 with an option price of 3.06 per ordinary share a 20% discount to the average market value of the shares in the week prior to the invitation date 17 -21 November 2008.
The Company also operates an International Sharesave Plan which mirrors the operation of the UK Sharesave Scheme as closely as possible.
However, instead of receiving a share option, participants receive the spread between the share price at the date of exercise and the grant price, delivered at the Companys discretion in cash or shares.
It is the Companys intention to satisfy the awards using shares only some of which are held by the Trust and some of which will be newly-issued.
The first grant under the International Sharesave Plan was made in October 2005 with an option grant price of 2.24 per ordinary share.
A second grant under the International Sharesave Plan was made in December 2008 with an option price of 3.06 per ordinary share.
Options under the UK Sharesave Scheme and International Sharesave Plan expire after a maximum of 3.5 years following the initial savings payments having been made.
The weighted average of the remaining contractual life for the first grant of the UK Sharesave Scheme and International Sharesave Plan at 31 December 2008 is 0.1 and 0.3 years, respectively.
The weighted average of the remaining contractual life for the second grant of the UK Sharesave Scheme and International Sharesave Plan at 31 December 2008 is 3.5 years and 3.5 years, respectively.
Options under the UK Sharesave Scheme and International Sharesave Plan have been valued using the Black Scholes model with the following assumptions: Sharesave Sharesave Sharesave Sharesave Scheme Scheme Plan Plan UK UK International International Grant date 21 July 2005 15 December 2008 19 October 2005 15 December 2008 Market price at date of Grant 3.14 4.44 2.80 4.44 Exercise price 2.24 3.06 2.24 3.06 Bad leaver rate 5%pa 3%pa 5%pa 3%pa Vesting period 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Volatility 35% 33.2% 34% 33.2% Dividend yield assumption 3.6% 3.36% 2.8% 3.36% Risk free interest rate 4.25% 2.46% 4.25% 2.46% Fair value per option 1.10 1.50 0.90 1.50 The historical volatility is based on the constituents of the FTSE 350 Telecoms Service Index, which was measured over three years to each of the grant dates.
The volatility assumption used for each of the awards is based on median volatility for the constituents of the sector.
Awards under the UK Share Incentive Plan SIP were made on 7 April 2006 and 10 April 2007.
The SIP is an HM Revenue & Customs approved plan open to all UK permanent employees and operates in conjunction with a UK tax-resident trust which holds shares on behalf of participating employees.
Under the SIP, the Company can award Free Shares up to a maximum value of 3,000 to employees.
Employees can also acquire Partnership Shares from their salary up to a maximum of 1,500 per annum and the Company will match this with up to two free Matching Shares per Partnership Share equivalent to a maximum value of 3,000 per annum.

Earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust, which are treated as cancelled, and after taking account of the restructuring of the existing share capital.

Currently the underlying shares in relation to our Convertible Bonds outstanding and the Share options in relation to employee share plans are the only categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares.
For the Convertible Bonds the weighted average of the maximum number of ordinary shares, assuming full conversion, is included in the calculation of the weighted average number of shares.
For employee share options a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and value of related future employee services.

Pension arrangements and post-retirement healthcare benets 1 Inmarsat Core provides both pension fund arrangements and post-retirement medical benets for its employees.
1 Inmarsat Core operates pension schemes in each of its principal locations.
The UK scheme has two plans: a dened benefit scheme, which is closed to new employees, and a dened contribution plan.
The dened benefit scheme is funded and its assets are held in a separate fund administered by a corporate trustee.
US$2.4m was credited in the Income Statement in the 2008 financial year in respect of the dened benefit scheme 2007: US$2.1m charged.
The dened benefit plan was valued using the projected unit credit method with the formal valuation undertaken by professionally qualied and independent actuaries, Watson Wyatt LLP, as at 31 December 2005.
The actuarial valuation of the assets of the scheme at that date, net of liabilities, was US$8.9m.
The results of the valuation have been updated for any material transactions and material changes in circumstances including changes in market prices and interest rates up to 31 December 2008.
The results of this updated valuation as at 31 December 2008, for the purposes of the additional disclosures required by IAS 19, are set out below.
The post-retirement healthcare benets are the provision of healthcare to retired employees and their dependants who were employed before 1 January 1998.
Employees who have 10 years of service at the age of 58 and retire are eligible to participate in the post-retirement healthcare benefit plans.
The plan is self-funded and there are no plan assets from which the costs are paid.
The cost of providing retiree healthcare is actuarially determined and accrued over the service period of the active employee group.
Membership of this plan is multi-national, although most staff are currently employed in the UK.
The obligation under these plans was determined by the application of the terms of medical plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates.
The long-term rate of medical expense ination used in the actuarial calculations is 4.0% per annum in excess of the rate of general price ination of 3.15% 2007: 4.0% in excess of 3.45%.
The discount rate used in determining the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was 6.1% at 31 December 2008 2007: 5.8%.
CIP provides pension fund arrangements for its employees and operates schemes in each of its principal locations.
The majority of CIPs employees are covered by dened contribution pension plans.
CIP also operates dened benefit pension plans, including an unfunded early retirement plan for the employees of its subsidiary Xantic B. V. US$0.5m was charged in the Income Statement in the period in respect of these dened benefit schemes 2007: US$nil.
The dened benefit plan was valued using the projected unit credit method with the formal valuation undertaken by professionally qualied and independent actuaries TKP Pension B. V. Netherlands as at 31 December 2008.

1 The healthcare cost trend rate assumption for Inmarsat Cores post-retirement healthcare benets has a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Income Statement in respect of the post-retirement medical benets.
Increasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point would have increased the post-retirement medical benefit obligation as of 31 December 2008 by US$5.2m 2007: US$5.1m and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by US$0.7m 2007: US$0.4m.
Decreasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point would have reduced the post-retirement medical benefit obligation as of 31 December 2008 by US$3.9m 2007: US$4.0m, and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by US$0.5m 2007: US$0.3m.

Financial instruments Treasury management and strategy 1 Inmarsat Cores treasury activities are managed by its corporate finance department under the direction of a Treasury Review Committee whose chairman is the Chief Financial officer, and are consistent with Board-approved treasury policies and guidelines.
The overriding objective of treasury activities is to manage financial risk.
Key features of treasury management include: 1 ensuring that Inmarsat Core is in a position to fund its obligations in appropriate currencies as they fall due: maintaining adequate undrawn borrowing facilities: economically hedging both contracted and anticipated foreign currency cash ows on a minimum twelve-month rolling basis with the option of covering exposures up to a maximum of three years forward: interest rate hedging: and maximising return on short-term investments.

pdf 60 27 3 09 17:09:09 27 3 09 17:09:09 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Treasury activities are only transacted with counterparties who are approved relationship banks.
Treasury foreign exchange policy is implemented primarily through the use of forward purchases of foreign currencies.
The treasury department is, however, authorised to use purchased options, futures and other derivative instruments, but only to the extent that such instruments form part of the hedging policy so as to establish a known rate of exchange.
Having arranged the purchase of foreign currency in line with the anticipated requirement for that currency over each financial year, an average rate of exchange is calculated from the agreed currency deals.
This average rate is applied as per requirements of IAS 21.
The policy is designed to minimise the impact of currency gains and losses in the Income Statement: gains and losses will arise to the extent that the level of actual payments in the period are different from those that were forecast.
1 The management of Inmarsat Core has no control over the financial and operating policies of CIP.
The treasury activities 1 of CIP are managed independently of Inmarsat Core by the management of CIP.
Capital risk management 1 1 Inmarsat Cores objective when managing its capital is to safeguard Inmarsat Cores ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benets for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 1 cost of capital.
Inmarsat Core continually evaluates sources of capital and may repurchase, renance, exchange or retire current or future borrowings and or debt securities from time to time in private or open-market transactions, or by any other means permitted 1 by the terms and conditions of borrowing facilities and debt securities.
Additionally Inmarsat Core may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
1 The capital structure of Inmarsat Core consists of debt, which includes borrowings note 20, cash and cash equivalents note 17 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent notes 26 and 28, comprising ordinary share capital, share premium, other reserves, equity reserve and retained earnings.
1 Inmarsat Cores overall strategy remains unchanged from 2008.
Capital risk of CIP is managed 1 independently of Inmarsat Core by the management of CIP.
