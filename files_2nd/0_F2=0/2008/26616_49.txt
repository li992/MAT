As at 31 March 2008, there were no forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges 2007: $230 million, and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges aggregated to nil 2007: $460 million.
The notional value of other derivative contracts is $287 million 2007: nil.
All contracts mature within one year.
b Market risk management i Seeding and other investments The Group invests in early stage managers as part of its ongoing business to build investment capacity.
These investments are generally held for less than one year at which point the investment is redeemed and either investor funds allocated, or the account closed.
The Group calculates the market risk on these investments using a value at risk VaR methodology using a one month time horizon, at a 95% confidence interval.
The increase in the VaR in 2008 compared with 2007 reflects the increased level of seed investments and the increase in historical volatilities.
2008 2007 VaR VaR Other investments in Other investments in fund products Close Avg Max Min fund products Close Avg Max Min $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m 1,279 70 59 72 51 829 47 39 49 32 ii Residual investment in MF Global and other assets The Groups residual investment in MF Global $221 million and exchange shares are held as available-for-sale financial assets, where gains and losses arising from movements in the share price are recorded in the available-for-sale reserve within equity.
Using a calculation based on the historical volatility of comparable firms share price movements over a one year period, a one standard deviation change results in a change in the value of the holding s in MF Global of 45% and Exchange shares of 45% 2007: 30%.
iii Foreign exchange and interest rate risk The majority of the Groups revenue streams, assets, liabilities and funding is denominated in US dollars and foreign currency transactions mainly relate to Sterling and Swiss Franc costs.
The Group, from time to time, puts in place short-term foreign currency contracts to hedge these costs.
The Groups net assets are exposed to the effect of movements in the exchange rate between the US dollar and other currencies, to the extent that the Group has net assets or liabilities in currencies other than the US dollar.
At 31 March 2008, a 10% strengthening weakening of the US dollar against all other currencies, with all other variables held constant, would not have had a significant impact.
The Groups monetary assets and liabilities earn incur interest indexed to floating rates and are therefore not exposed to interest rate risk.

At 31 March 2008, 74% of the Groups financial assets subject to credit risk were rated AAor above 2007: 78%, and a further 11% were rated Ato A 2007: 11%.
As at 31 March 2008, 98% of the Groups financial assets were neither past due nor impaired 2007: 99%.
Amounts past due have been subsequently received in full.
No significant impairments were recorded in either the current or comparative financial years.
The weighted average balance of amounts owed by fund products during the financial year ended 31 March 2008 was $691 million 2007: $692 million.
The maximum credit risk exposure is equivalent to the carrying fair value of the balances shown.
The MF Global facility and Empyrean Re commitments are disclosed separately in Note 8 d. ii Concentrations of credit risk At 31 March 2008, the Groups single largest counterparty exposure is $450 million held with a AA rated bank 2007: $1,229 million.
The largest loan to a fund was $44 million 2007: $25 million.
The amount of these exposures can change significantly each month.
d Financial guarantees and commitments i Committed purchase agreements In respect of some of its structured products, the Group has made a commitment to provide monthly liquidity for some of their underlying investments in fund products which otherwise have only quarterly liquidity by purchasing these shares.
This commitment allows these structured products to rebalance their portfolios and offer monthly redemption terms to investors.
The Groups commitment at 31 March 2008 covers investments in existing funds totalling $2.65 billion 2007: $3.56 billion.
At 31 March 2008, the aggregate risk of loss to which the Group was exposed in relation to committed purchase agreements amounted to $87 million 2007: $105 million at a 99.9% confidence level, taking into account the contingent nature of these exposures and the probability of a loss being incurred on any resulting holding.
104 MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 Financial Performance FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ii MF Global brokerage account MF Global has put in place a $400 million daylight overdraft facility for certain funds which is guaranteed by the Group.
This guarantee has a 364 day term and can be cancelled on any day by giving notice prior to 10:00 hours.
Under normal circumstances, the Group has no exposure to the guarantee at the end of any given day.
iii Loan facilities provided to the funds The Group provides committed loan facilities to the MAST structures.
These are collateralised fund obligations providing financing support to a range of Man structured products.
The facilities exist to provide liquidity and bridging facilities rather than to provide permanent leverage.
The Group manages the CFO portfolios to ensure that sufficient underlying investments are liquidated to meet ongoing fee and coupon payments.
As a result, drawings are infrequent and small in relation to the facilities available.
Utilisation under these facilities at the financial year end was as follows: 2008 2007 Commitment Utilisation Commitment Utilisation $m $m $m $m MAST 1 125 MAST 2 25 25 Man Glenwood Asset Holdings MAST2 3 189 192 214 342 Otherwise all of the loan facilities which the Group provides to its fund products are uncommitted.
iv Commitments made by Empyrean Re Empyrean Re writes short-term trade credit insurance and reinsurance on a global basis.
It is exposed to credit risk in the event that losses resulting from defaults by the underlying obligors in each reinsurance contract exceed the deductible under that contract.
Empyrean Re manages credit default risk by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of the underlying obligors and maintaining exposures within limits.
The portfolio risk is modelled taking into account each reinsurance contract including deductibles, limits, coinsurance and reinstatements using a proprietary quantitative model.
Capital market transactions are undertaken to maintain the portfolio within a risk-based limit.
Empyrean Re primarily employs Moodys KMV Expected Default Frequency EDF to determine the probability of default PD and the rating.
Credit exposures at 31 March 2008 are $548 million 2007: $87 million.
Approximately 74% of Empyrean Res credit exposures have a rating equivalent to an Aor better.
No single exposure is greater than $99 million.
The economic capital calculation at a 99.9% confidence interval is $24 million.
Capital management The Group monitors its capital requirements through continuous review of its regulatory capital and economic capital, including monthly reporting to Finance Committee and the Group Board.
The Group has been in compliance with the Regulatory Capital requirements at all times during the year.
The Groups Financial Resources at 31 March 2008 is $2,619 million 2007: $2,272 million, as set out in the top half of the table in the Governance and Risk Management section on page 59.
