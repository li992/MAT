i Sharesave Scheme The weighted average fair value of equity-settled share options granted during the year under the Sharesave Scheme, as estimated at the date of grant, was 2.23 2007: 1.75.
This was calculated using the Black-Scholes share option pricing model, using the following weighted average assumptions: 2008 2007 Share price 6.93 5.66 Exercise price 5.38 4.53 Expected volatility 23.0% 25.4% Expected life 4.1 years 3.5 years Expected dividends 2.2% 2.2% Risk-free interest rate 5.0% 4.8% ii Senior Management Scheme The weighted average fair value of equity-settled share options granted during the year under the Senior Management Schemes, as estimated at the date of grant, was 5.54 2007: 4.38.

The fair value of nil-priced options granted during the year was measured on the basis of the marketprice of the Companys shares on the date of grant, discounted for expected dividends which would not be received over the vesting period of the options.
The following weighted average assumptions were used in calculating these fair values: 2008 2007 Share price 6.53 5.49 Exercise price 0.00 0.00 Expected volatility 18.9% 23.6% Expected life 1.9 years 3.0 years Expected dividends 2.4% 2.2% Risk-free interest rate 5.3% 4.8% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price, over a period equal to the expected life of the options.
