ASTRAZENECA ANNuAl REpoRT ANd FoRm 20-F INFoRmATIoN 2008 ADDITIONAL INfOrmATION 191 During 2008, AstraZenecas share re-purchase programme, which was introduced in 1999, continued with the re-purchase and subsequent cancellation of 13.6 million shares at a total cost of $610m, representing 0.9% of the total issued share capital of the Company.
The average price paid per share in 2008 was 2397 pence.
This brings the total number of shares repurchased to date since the beginning of the re-purchase programme in 1999, to 376.3 million Ordinary Shares at an average price of 2661 pence per share for a consideration, including expenses, of $18,099m.
The excess of the consideration over the nominal value was charged against the profit and loss account reserve.
Shares issued in respect of share schemes totalled 4.1 million.
In 1999, in connection with the merger, AstraZenecas share capital was redenominated in US dollars.
On 6 April 1999, Zeneca shares were cancelled and US dollar shares issued, credited as fully paid on the basis of one dollar share for each Zeneca share then held.
This was achieved by a reduction of capital under section 135 of the Companies Act 1985.
Upon the reduction of capital becoming effective, all issued and unissued Zeneca shares were cancelled and the sum arising as a result thereof credited to a special reserve, which was converted into US dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the record date.
This US dollar reserve was then applied in paying up, at par, newly created US dollar shares.
At the same time as the US dollar shares were issued, the Company issued 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares with a nominal value of 1.00 each for cash at par.
The Redeemable Preference Shares carry limited class voting rights and no dividend rights.
This class of shares is also capable of redemption at par at the option of the Company on the giving of seven days written notice to the registered holder of the shares.
A total of 826 million AstraZeneca shares were issued to Astra shareholders who accepted the merger offer before the final closing date, 21 May 1999.
AstraZeneca received acceptances from Astra shareholders representing 99.6% of Astras shares and the remaining 0.4% was acquired in 2000 for cash.

Except where otherwise indicated, figures included in this Report relating to pharmaceutical product market sizes and market shares are obtained from syndicated industry sources, primarily IMS Health IMS, a market research firm internationally recognised by the pharmaceutical industry.
The 2008 market share figures included in this report are based primarily on data obtained from an online IMS database.
IMS data may differ from that compiled by the Group with respect to its own products.
Of particular significance in this regard are the following: 1 AstraZeneca publishes its financial results on a financial year and quarterly interim basis, whereas IMS issues its data on a monthly and quarterly basis: 2 the online IMS database is updated quarterly and uses the average exchange rates for the relevant quarter: 3 IMS data from the US is not adjusted for Medicaid and similar state rebates: and 4 IMS sales data are compiled using actual wholesaler data and data from statistically representative panels of retail and hospital pharmacies, which data are then projected by IMS to give figures for national markets.
References to prevalence of disease have been derived from a variety of sources and are not intended to be indicative of the current market or any potential market for AstraZenecas pharmaceutical products since, among other things, there may be no correlation between the prevalence of a disease and the number of individuals who are treated for such a disease.
