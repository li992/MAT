Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1 Corporate information The Group Financial Statements of Moneysupermarket.
com Group PLC Company, a company incorporated in England, and its subsidiaries for the period ended 31 December 2008 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 24 February 2009.
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Company Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 75 to 79.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
Comparative figures presented in the Financial Statements represent the six months and nine days ended 31 December 2007.
The Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors deem appropriate, given the Groups positive cash position and lack of debt.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below.
The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, are described in more detail in the relevant accounting policies and accompanying notes: Notes 3 and 12 goodwill and other intangibles, including their amortisation and impairment Note 13 revenue recognition Note 13 provision for doubtful debts Note 14 accruals Note 18 share-based payments Basis of consolidation These Group Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Group Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Foreign currency The Group Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
The functional currency of the foreign operation Icero GmbH is the euro.
The income and expenses of the foreign operation are translated into sterling at an average exchange rate for the period in which the activity occurred.
The assets and liabilities of the foreign operation are translated into sterling using exchange rates ruling as at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising upon translation is taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised as a profit or loss.
Revenue Internet business The Group generates fees from internet lead generation click based revenue, commissions from brokerage sales and advertising through a variety of contractual arrangements.
The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that the lead is generated.
Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the customer.
Advertising revenue is recognised in the period when an advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Intermediary business Commissions are recognised on completed transactions in the period that a transaction completes.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2008 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until brought into use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 50 years Plant and equipment including IT equipment 3 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Office equipment 5 years The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.
Intangible assets Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method.
The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All the Groups intangible assets other than goodwill have been identified as having finite useful lives.
As such, they are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at each financial year end.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Income Statement in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Market-related 10 years Customer relationships 7 years Customer lists 3 years Technology 3 years Market-related intangible assets are defined as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and services, for example trademarks, trade names and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer lists, customer contracts and relationships, and non-contractual customer relationships.
For accounting purposes, customer relationships and customer lists have been identified separately.
Relationships with high-profile customers provide the Group with prominence in the marketplace, create volume and traffic on the website, and enhance the reputation of the brand.
Customer lists allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and unpatented technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Groups assets is taken to be the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged to the Income Statement when incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the criteria outlined in SIC 32.
Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Income Statement.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2008 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Cash Flow Statement.
Employee benefits Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred.
Share-based payment transactions The share option programme allows certain Group employees to acquire shares of Moneysupermarket.
com Group PLC: these awards are granted by Moneysupermarket.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Income Statement as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Net finance income Net finance income comprises interest payable and interest receivable, which are recognised in the Income Statement as they accrue using the effective interest method.
Dividends Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders equity in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
A deferred tax liability was recognised in the prior period as 30% of the value of the intangible assets with finite lives which were generated upon the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited, representing the tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in future periods.
At the prior period end, this liability was revalued at the enacted corporation tax rate of 28%, this being the rate at which the liability will unwind.
This liability will decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the deferred tax credit recognised in the Income Statement in accordance with IAS 12.
Group management of capital The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2008 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In assessing the level of capital all components of equity are taken into account, i. e. share capital and retained earnings and reserves where applicable.
The Group manages its cash balances by depositing them with a number of financial institutions to reduce credit risk.
The Group has no debt as at 31 December 2008 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements: management of capital therefore focuses around its ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds.
The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
Accounting standards issued but not yet effective A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued during the year ended 31 December 2008 but are not yet effective, and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Group: IFRS 8 Operating Segments introduces the management approach to segmental reporting.
IFRS 8, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2009 Financial Statements, will require the disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each segments performance and to allocate resources to them.
Currently the Group presents segment information on a business and geographical segment basis see note 4.
The Group expects to present its segmental reporting on a different basis in the future.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes addresses the accounting by entities that operate, or otherwise participate in, customer loyalty programmes for their customers.
It relates to customer loyalty programmes under which the customer can redeem credits for awards such as free or discounted goods or services.
IFRIC 13, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2009 Financial Statements, is not expected to have any impact on the Group Financial Statements.
Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation Of Financial Statements requires presentation of all non-owner changes in equity either in a single statement of comprehensive equity, or in an income statement plus a statement of comprehensive equity.
The amended standard, which will become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 with earlier adoption permitted, will require a change in the presentation of the Groups Financial Statements.
Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to an acquisition, construction, or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of the asset, removing the option to recognise the costs as an expense.
The revised standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The Group currently holds no borrowings, so the standard is expected to have no impact on the Group Financial Statements.
Amendment to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 Cost Of An Investment In A Subsidiary requires changes to the accounting for a noncontrolling interest in and the loss of control of a subsidiary.
The amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, and apply retrospectively, except in certain circumstances, are not expected to have any impact on the Group Financial Statements.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share Based Payments: Vesting Conditions And Cancellations changes the definition of vesting conditions within IFRS 2 to clarify that vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions, with other conditions considered non-vesting.
Under the amendment, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in measuring the grant date fair value of the share based payment and there is no true-up of equity-settled arrangements for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Therefore if all vesting conditions are met, then the entity will recognise the grant date fair value of the equity-settled share based payment as a compensation cost, even if the counterparty does not become entitled to the share based payment due to a failure to meet a non-vesting condition.
The amendment applies retrospectively to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, with earlier application permitted.
The Group does not expect the amendment to have any impact on the Group Financial Statements.
Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation Of Financial Statements provides exemptions from the requirement to classify as a liability financial instruments under which an entity has an unavoidable obligation to deliver cash.
The exemptions apply to two categories only of instruments issued by an entity, being puttable financial instruments, or an instrument or components of instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation.
The amendments set out detailed definitions and circumstances that must be met before these exemptions are available.
The amendments to IAS 32 lead to consequential amendments to IAS 1, IFRS 7 and IFRIC 2.
The amendments to IAS 32 are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, with earlier adoption permitted.
The Group does not currently hold any financial instruments falling within the scope of the amendment, and therefore does not expect the amendment to have any impact on the Group Financial Statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition And Measurement Eligible Hedged Items addresses the two situations where the IASB considered that diversity existed or was likely to exist, being the designation of one-sided risk in a hedged item, and the designation of inflation in a financial hedged item.
The amendment does not replace existing guidance, but simply provides additional application guidance to clarify the existing principles in relation to what items can qualify for hedge accounting, assessing hedge effectiveness and designating financial items as hedged items.
The amendment is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, and is not expected to have any impact on the Group Financial Statements.
The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of other new standards and interpretations which may be endorsed by the European Union and require adoption by the Group in future accounting periods.

Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

com Group PLC Annual Report 2008 12 Intangible assets Market Customer Customer Technology related relationship list related Goodwill Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Cost: On acquisition of Moneysupermarket.
During 2007 the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualified and experienced independent third party to value the intangible assets acquired from Moneysupermarket.
This valuation was used as the initial carrying value for these assets.
Since the goodwill and intangibles have historically constituted approximately 90% of the Groups net assets balance, the Group has tended to use its quoted market price to provide assurance over the value, or indicate impairment of, its assets.
At the balance sheet date and prior to any impairment, the market capitalisation of the Group represented 92% of the total carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets 2007: market capitalisation exceeded carrying value by 70%.
Whilst not directly comparable, the quoted market price acts as an indicator of impairment, and in light of this, the Group has performed a thorough assessment during the period to consider whether its non-current assets are impaired.
Impairment testing of goodwill On an annual basis, or where an indication exists, the Group is required to assess its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment.
Given the worsening economic conditions and the turmoil in the credit and wider financial markets, the impairment testing has been performed on the following basis.
For the current period, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use and was calculated by reference to the cash flows taken from the Groups forecasts as detailed below.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Group has one significant cash generating unit CGU, the internet segment, to which all of the goodwill has been allocated.
The segment is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The present value of its future cash flows has been calculated with the following key assumptions applied: Cash flows for year 1 represent managements best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2008, and are based upon the Groups approved budget for 2009.
The main assumptions underlying the 2009 budget relate to visitor numbers and revenue per transaction visitor.
The budget reflects the general downturn in the consumer economy and expected lower levels of credit available to consumers and lower levels of discretionary expenditure in general.
Subsequent cash flows for future years assume 0% growth in earnings from those forecast for 2009.
Management believe this reflects the tightening of lending criteria, withdrawal of products by providers, and the general downturn in the economy.
No reliable third party estimates of long term growth rates exist given it is a relatively new business model.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been incorporated in the calculations.
A pre-tax discount rate of 16% has been used in the forecast.
This reflects the increased risk and uncertainty inherent in the current economic climate, the lack of confidence with which the near future can be forecast, and the additional risks specific to the Group and the industry in which it operates.
When the economy begins to recover a different set of assumptions may be more appropriate.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2008 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 12 Intangible assets continued Impairment testing of goodwill The analysis performed calculates the value in use of the internet segment as 237.2m, indicating that the segments assets are impaired as follows: 000 Value in use of internet segment 237,249 Representing: Carrying value of tangible non-current assets 13,596 Carrying value of other intangible non-current assets 168,688 Implied book value of goodwill 54,965 Carrying value of goodwill 124,965 Impairment of goodwill 70,000 An impairment loss of 70.0m has been recognised in the year and therefore there is no difference between the carrying amount and recoverable amount of the goodwill balance as at the balance sheet date.
An increase of 1% in the discount rate, with all other assumptions held constant, would give rise to an additional impairment charge of 14.5m.
A decrease of 1% in the value of cash flows generated, with all other assumptions held constant, would give rise to an additional impairment charge of 2.4m.
Impairment testing of other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment For impairment testing purposes, all of the Groups intangible, and other non-current, assets are also assigned to the internet segment.
With reference to the testing described above, the value in use of 237.2m assigned to the internet segment indicates that neither the other intangible, nor other non-current, assets are impaired.
