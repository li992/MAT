Financial instruments An outline of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to financial instruments is set out in the Financial Review on pages 30 and 31 of this report, and in note 2 on pages 63 to 70.
Nature and extent of risk associated with financial instruments Market risk As an upstream oil & gas company, the Company is subject to many risks, at both the macro and micro level, including currency, interest and credit risk, arising in the normal course of the Groups business.
The Business Review on pages 7 and 8 describes these risks in more detail, but also provides the Companys view of the principal risks facing the Company that potentially have a medium to high impact on the Company.
In particular, this highlights a number of risks which have emerged as a result of the rapid deterioration of the global economy into recession and the liquidity and credit crises in the world banking markets.
Risks such as inability to finance work programmes, or potential default of coventurers and suppliers are all now higher profile risks facing the sector and the Company.
The Company has however, recently secured a new source of bank funding for the next three years and generally partners with larger well established upstream companies, so believes it has mitigated these risks.
The Company has a geographically diverse portfolio of assets and remains unhedged with respect to commodity price, interest rates and currency fluctuations.
Specific financial instrument risks are therefore deemed to be of low probability in nature and of low impact in quantum relative to the macro risks highlighted above.
It is against this backdrop and context that the following disclosure on the nature and extent of risks from financial instruments is provided.
Financial assets and liabilities: credit risk The financial assets of the Group are subject to floating charges provided to the debt provider for the new debt facility secured during 2009 see note 36.
As such the financial assets are subject to certain terms and conditions further explained below which help preserve the credit worthiness of the asset to the debt providers.
Cash and cash equivalents Unless agreed otherwise, all such balances must be maintained with institutions party to the debt facility.
The Group may however, make money market deposits for up to six months duration and up to 40 million, with any institution whose senior unsecured credit and unguaranteed long term corporate debt rating is at least equivalent to Standard and Poors AA-.

Financial instruments Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk in trade receivables is minimal.
The Group does not have continued a trading arm, but sells produced hydrocarbons only to recognised and creditworthy parties, typically the trading arm of large, international oil & gas companies.
European crudes sales are primarily sold under an annual contract at agreed premia or discounts to Brent, depending upon crude quality.
Sales are typically generated on a monthly entitlement basis rather than crude liftings to facilitate regular cashflow.
Sales of gas from the Groups older UK gas fields are sold under long-term contracts with built-in escalation mechanisms.
Gas production from the newly developed Cavendish field in the UK is also sold under an annual contract at day ahead pricing.
European credit terms normally require settlement within 15 days of invoicing and accordingly impairment exposure is minimal, a fact supported by track record.
With the acquisition of crude production in Egypt, the ageing profile of trade and other receivables has been extended.
Egyptian crude is sold predominantly to government organisations but also to large international trading companies.
Country practice is for much extended credit terms of up to 120 days, but particularly with the government organisations there is also an established practice of offsetting liabilities due to the counterparty, which facilitates the management of such receivables.
Management of this extended credit exposure is one of the key objectives of the Egyptian business unit management team.
Also in Egypt, the Groups operations in the East Zeit field, provides infrastructure access and logistics support services to third parties operating in the same locale.
These other receivables occasionally prove problematic to collect and require active pursuit by management.
Past practice would indicate that any impairment exposure is not material in the context of the Egyptian business.
As of 27 March 2009 71.2% of receivables outstanding at the year end have been collected.
An ageing analysis of trade receivables is disclosed in note 17 a.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets and liabilities is represented by their carrying value as at the balance sheet date as set out in the summary table below.
Financial assets and liabilities: Liquidity risk Cash and cash equivalents As at 31 December 2008, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of 158,948,000 2007: 115,960,000.
In response to the crisis impacting the banking sector during 2008, the Group diversified the number of banks with which it had a deposit relationship, and reduced the tenor of such deposits.

Financial instruments Borrowings and financial liabilities The Groups interests are predominantly non-operated in nature and payments to suppliers continued occur only after goods and or services have been received.
For operated activity, material or long-term contracts will generally only be awarded after a tender process, where supplier creditworthiness will be evaluated.
Also where a drilling management contractor has been engaged, specific contractual arrangements have been put in place to govern and control the disbursement of funds by the intermediary.
During 2008, the Group fully repaid all bank debt and continued to service the coupon on the 2014 Guaranteed Convertible Bond.
The Convertible Bond has an investor put in July 2012.
An analysis of the maturity profile of the Groups borrowing financial liabilities is shown in note 21a and details of the underlying facilities are detailed in note 21b and note 22.
The undiscounted cash flows associated with the maturity profile is noted in the table below.
As noted above, the Group currently has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to repay in full borrowings currently drawn.
2008 2007 Amounts falling due 000 000 in one year or less or on demand 41,761 39,139 in more than one year but not more than two years 4,102 80,049 1 in more than two years but not more than five years 153,813 153,810 199,676 272,998 1 assuming bondholders exercise their put option in 2012.
In February 2009, the Group agreed a new three-year USD400 million revolving credit facility with the Bank of Scotland.
This replaces the existing facility with ABN AMRO Bank N. V. which has been cancelled.
This together with the Groups cash resources, should provide sufficient liquidity for the Group until normality returns to the credit markets.
Financial assets and liabilities: Interest rate risk Details of the Groups interest rate risk profile on financial assets and liabilities is set out below.
The fixed rate and competitive nature of the Convertible Debt coupon of 2.9% per annum, provides excellent protection against the risk of changes in market interest rates and complements the variable interest rate applicable to the Bank debt.
USD LIBOR which underpins the Bank debt has also reduced significantly and remains under downward pressure, as the US government seek to use interest rates to fight recessionary pressures.
Accordingly in 2008, the Group continued to enjoy an extremely low cost of finance and profits provide substantial interest cover.

Financial instruments Financial assets continued Fixed rate Floating rate financial financial assets assets 1 year 1 year Total 000 000 000 2008 Cash and cash equivalents 122,856 36,092 158,948 2007 Cash and cash equivalents 83,328 32,632 115,960 Cash and cash equivalents which are presented as a single class of asset on the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and other short-term deposits and liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
At 31 December 2008, short-term deposits and liquid investments were earning interest at a weighted average fixed deposit rate of 3.78% 2007: 6.12%.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on a discount to USD GBP LIBOR.
Financial liabilities Fixed rate Floating rate financial financial liabilities liabilities 1 year 1 year Total 000 000 000 2008 Convertible Bond 115,767 115,767 115,767 115,767 2007 Bank loan 75,268 75,268 Convertible Bond 111,989 111,989 111,989 75,268 187,257 The fixed rate liability comprises the convertible bonds issued which bear an interest coupon of 2.9% per annum until the maturity of the bonds in 2014 or on the exercise of the investor put on the fifth anniversary of the issue date July 2012.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are noninterest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
The Groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on its financial liabilities.
If the interest rates for the year were to have changed by - 1% in 2008, with all other variables held constant, it is estimated that the Groups profit before tax for 2008 would have decreased increased by 1,531,000 2007: 1,300,000.

Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities: Currency risk continued The predominant functional currency within the Group is sterling but due to the Groups USD denominated oil production, the Group does remain exposed to fluctuations in the USD currency, the primary area of currency risk.
Such exposures can be hedged against using financial instruments but the Group takes the view that this would be inconsistent with the Groups unhedged position on commodity price, given the historic inverse correlation between movements in the price of oil and movements in the USD.
Whilst this approach may give rise to currency exchange gains and losses, these are in effect largely offset by corresponding gains and losses in the value of crude oil sales.
Egyptian activities are undertaken by USD reporting entities given that this is the main currency of the underlying operations, with only a relatively minor exposure to Egyptian pounds.
This creates exposure to currency translation risks which is mitigated by the USD bank debt drawn by the UK subsidiary acquiring these entities.
Once again this may give rise to currency gains and losses, but these will be offset by corresponding gains and losses in the underlying financial results of the Egyptian subsidiaries.
Dana Petroleum Norway AS has a functional currency of NOK, the predominant source currency of the Companys cost base.
Revenues, being generated from crude sales are however, USD denominated.
In cash terms the Group is short GBP and NOK, and long USD.
The Group is however, able to make deposits of USD, on a dual or tri-currency basis, where in return for pre-agreed exchange rates, and interest yields significantly ahead of vanilla USD deposit rates, the Group grants the counterparty the right to return the original deposit, in the nominated currency of their choice, namely USD, GBP or NOK.
Using this mechanism the Group has been able to achieve deposit yields much higher than those available on vanilla USD deposits.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups profit before tax and the Groups equity.
