Fixed rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
The Borrowing Base Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling or US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 100 basis points to 240 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD assets.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31 August 2012, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
There is no requirement under the Borrowing Base Facility to hedge interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR.
The Borrowing Base Facility states that consideration should be given to hedging at least 30% of the interest rate exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR for Sterling and US Dollars in respect of loans under the facility, net of relevant cash balances.
The Hardman Bridge Facility is now a US$200 million 138.1 million revolving facility which is repayable in full on 31 December 2009.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 300 basis points increasing in quarterly 25 basis point increments until expiry in December 2009.

The Company is exposed to floating rate interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The company hedges its floating rate interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate derivatives, namely interest rate swaps, interest rate collars and interest rate caps.
All interest rate derivatives currently in place were put in place for a three-year period in May 2008 and expire in May 2011.
The interest rate swap currently in place has a swap rate of 3.4375% for a current notional principal of US$50 million 34.5 million.
The effect of the interest rate collar currently in place limits the exposure to US Dollar LIBOR at varying rates maximum of 4.3% over the life of the derivative for a current notional principal of US$50 million 34.5 million.
The combined mark to market position as at the 2008 year end was 2,089,000 2007: 104,000.
The interest rate hedges are included in fixed rate debt in the 2008 and were included in the floating rate debt table in 2007 as there was non-material differences between book and fair values for the mark-to-markets on the hedges in place at the time.
