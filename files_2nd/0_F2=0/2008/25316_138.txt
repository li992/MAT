The Group uses interest rate swaps in order to fix the interest payable on a large proportion of its borrowings and foreign currency contracts to hedge against specified future foreign currency cash flows.
In addition the Group also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge against forecast profits denominated in foreign currency.
These foreign exchange contracts do not hedge against a specific future cash flow so do not qualify for hedge accounting: changes in their fair value are therefore taken to the income statement.
None of these contracts were outstanding at the balance sheet date.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps cash flow hedges to hedge those interest cash flows that are expected to occur within four years of the balance sheet date and foreign currency swaps cash flow hedges to hedge those foreign currency cash flows that are expected to occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
The effect on the income statement will also be within these periods.
An amount of 8.9m has been charged to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges 2007: credit of 1.4m, Company: credit of 0.2m 2007: nil.

These interest rate swaps cover a proportion of both current borrowings and forecast future borrowings which includes rollovers of current borrowings.

A charge of nil 2007: 0.2m has been made to the income statement in the year representing the movement in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps.

The Company held no interest rate swaps in 2007.
