The investment represents 17.8% of the share capital of Songbird Estates plc which in turn owns 60.8% of Canary Wharf Group plc.
In view of the control rights of other shareholders, the investment is not equity accounted.
Intangible assets relate to fund management contracts which are amortised over the expected remaining life of each contract, which ranged from six to 10 years at acquisition.
The original fair value was 79m 2007: 75m with accumulated amortisation at 31 March 2008 being 40m 2007: 25m.

Trade and other debtors are shown after deducting a provision for bad and doubtful debts of 9m 2007: 5m.
The charge to the income statement was 4m 2007: 2m.
The increase in the trade debtor impairment charge reflects the application of the Groups provisioning policy in respect of bad and doubtful debts.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other debtors approximates their fair value.
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade debtors as the Group has a large number of customers, who are paying their rental in advance.
Trade payables are interest free and have settlement dates within one year.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates their fair value.
As at 31 March, trade and other debtors outside their payment terms yet not provided for are as follows: Outside credit terms but not impaired Total Within credit terms 0-1 month 1-2 months More than 2 months m m m m m 2008 101 73 1945 2007 95 73 1615 16 Other non-current liabilities 2008 2007 m m Obligations under finance leases 35 30 Minority interest 3 7 38 37 17 Deferred taxation Deferred tax is calculated on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 28% 2007: 30% as described in note 8.
The movement on deferred tax is as shown below: Credited Credited 1April expensed expensed 31March 2007 Acquisition to income to reserves 2008 m m m m m Property and investment revaluations 160 42 25 93 Other timing differences 4 4 Intangible assets 15 4 11 179 46 25 108 Credited Credited 1April expensed expensed 31March 2006 Acquisition to income to reserves 2007 m m m m m Property and investment revaluations 1,216 151 1,181 26 160 Capital allowances 124 2 126 Other timing differences 29 23 10 4 Intangible assets 20 5 15 1,331 153 1,289 16 179 Under the REIT regime development properties which are sold within three years of completion do not benefit from tax exemption.
At 31 March 2008 the value of properties under development is 1,806m 2007: 1,220m and if these properties were to be sold and tax exemption was not available the tax arising would be 75m 2007: 100m.
No provision is made for this amount as the Group has no current plans to sell these properties.
