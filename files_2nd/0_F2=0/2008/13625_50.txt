There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from the use of forward contracts.
The hedged forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next two years.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity note 16 on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 December 2008 are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
Financial instruments Financial risk and treasury policies The treasury department maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Groups bankers, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk and provides a treasury service to the Groups businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The Group treasury department is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged by the use of forward exchange contracts.
i CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and monies on deposit with financial institutions.
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced through the use of credit insurance covering 60%-75% of trade receivables at any time.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set above this depending on the value of the sale.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of non-insured receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.

Financial instruments continued Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: CARRYING AMOUNT 2008 2007 Trade receivables 63,694 44,262 Other receivables 6,715 5,595 Cash and cash equivalents 41,390 38,253 Currency swap deposit 2,175 2,975 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging: Assets 239 95 Total 114,213 91,180 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by currency was: CARRYING AMOUNT 2008 2007 Sterling 7,138 4,658 US dollar 14,444 7,408 Euro 31,248 24,444 Other 10,864 7,752 Total 63,694 44,262 Provisions against trade receivables The aging of trade receivables and associated provision for impairment at the reporting date was: GROSS PROVISION GROSS PROVISION 2008 2008 2007 2007 Not past due 42,778 88 31,366 13 Past due 0-30 days 11,394 173 9,296 48 Past due 31-60 days 5,860 53 2,520 47 Past due 61-90 days 1,938 60 889 25 Past due more than 91 days 3,092 994 799 475 65,062 1,368 44,870 608 ii LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is highly cash generative, and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on investments.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses, but it maintains a 2m overdraft facility 2007: 2m on which interest would be payable at LIBOR plus 100 basis points.

Financial instruments continued iii MARKET RISKS Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups results.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within suitable parameters.
a Currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk primarily are US dollar and related currencies and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 80% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using forward exchange contracts.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than sterling, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges at 31 December 2008 was a 7,310,000 liability 2007: 544,000 liability comprising an asset of 239,000 2007: 95,000 and a liability of 7,549,000 2007: 639,000.
Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
Forward exchange contracts in place at 31 December 2008 mature in 2009 and 2010.
The Group entered into a currency swap in February 2005 when9.0m was borrowed to finance the acquisition of PC Intertechnik, linked to a deposit of 6.2m, at an exchange rate of1.444 1.000.
The9.0m was paid to Rotork Controls Deutschland GmbH in a form of redeemable equity as this company purchased the assets of PC Intertechnik.
This swap was entered into to protect the Group from currency movements on the repayment of equity from Germany.
Sensitivity analysis It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal in particular other exchange rates, a general change of one cent in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have had a 250,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax and a one euro cent movement against sterling would have had a 250,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves assessing the transaction impact of US dollar and euro cash flows and the translation impact of US dollar and euro profits.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: AVERAGE RATE CLOSING RATE 2008 2007 2008 2007 US dollar 1.80 2.01 1.44 1.99 Euro 1.24 1.45 1.03 1.36 b Interest rate risk The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area.
All foreign currency cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and where rates are fixed the period of the fix is generally no more than one month.
The main element of interest rate risk concerns sterling deposits which are made on a floating LIBOR based rate and short-term overdrafts in foreign currencies which are also on a floating rate.
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank loans overdrafts bearing interest rates fixed by reference to the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial liabilities is 4.6% 2007: 3.9% per annum.
The weighted average period for which interest rates on the fixed rate financial liabilities are fixed is one year.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2008 2007 In one year or less 157 118 In more than one year but not more than two years 86 98 In more than two years but not more than five years 62 66 In more than five years 42 45 Total 347 327 At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instruments was as follows: Fixed rate instruments CARRYING AMOUNT 2008 2007 Financial assets 17,643 24,058 Financial liabilities 278 228 17,365 23,830 All foreign currency cash deposits are held on fixed rates of interest in the UK.
All other cash amounts are on floating rates or overnight rates based on the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.

Financial instruments continued iv CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Groups net funds at the balance sheet date were: 2008 2007 Total borrowings 347 327 Cash and cash equivalents note 15 41,390 38,253 Group net funds 41,043 37,926 v FAIR VALUES The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet, were as follows: CARRYING CARRYING AMOUNT FAIR VALUE AMOUNT FAIR VALUE 2008 2008 2007 2007 Loans and receivables Trade receivables 63,694 63,694 44,262 44,262 Other receivables 6,715 6,715 5,595 5,595 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 41,390 41,390 38,253 38,253 Currency swap deposit 2,175 2,175 2,975 2,975 Designated cash flow hedges Forward exchange contracts: Assets 239 239 95 95 Liabilities 7,549 7,549 639 639 Financial liabilities at amortised cost Trade and other payables 59,584 59,584 40,161 40,161 Secured loans 27 27 54 54 Preference shares 42 42 45 45 Finance lease liabilities 278 278 228 228 Currency swap loan 2,175 2,175 2,975 2,975 44,558 44,558 47,078 47,078 As the elements of the currency swap can legally be offset, although the values of the loan and deposit are shown above they have been offset in the consolidated balance sheet.
Basis for determining fair values The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table above.
Designated cash flow hedges Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the contracts value date, and gains and losses taken to equity.
Secured loans As the loans have a flexible repayment schedule, and may be paid down in less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Trade and other receivables payables As the majority of receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
