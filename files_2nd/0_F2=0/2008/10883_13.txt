Taxation continued Factors that may affect future tax charge During the year, as a result of the change in the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% that will be effective from 1 April 2008, the deferred tax expected to reverse has been measured using the 28% tax rate.
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2008 Budget Statement and are expected to be enacted in the 2008 Finance Act.
These include changes to the industrial buildings allowance regime.
The changes have not been substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date and are therefore not included in these regulatory accounting statements.
However, changes to the industrial buildings allowance regime are expected to have a 13m tax charge impact.
