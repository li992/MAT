Financial Statements 21 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued Foreign exchange risk: The Group is exposed to limited cross-border foreign exchange commitments and, where significant, these are hedged at inception using forward foreign currency contracts.
These exposures arise mainly through stock purchases.
The Groups foreign exchange position is calculated daily and any positions are closed out immediately unless the exposure is trivial.
In some circumstances, particularly for highly volatile currencies, the Group also hedges future currency commitments, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
Group policy permits the use of long-term derivative treasury products such as cross-currency swaps for the management of currency risk, although none is currently held.
The currencies in which the main Group exposures arise include Euro, US Dollar, Swiss Franc, Swedish Krona and South African Rand.
Translation foreign currency risk for example, investments in overseas assets or the funding of subsidiaries is hedged using foreign exchange swaps or currency borrowings, as appropriate, at all times.
A significant proportion of Group borrowings is held in Euro and Swiss Franc for this purpose.
However, in line with Group policy, balance sheet translation risk is not hedged against adverse movements in exchange rates and the results of any such movements are taken to reserves.
Likewise, the translation risk on converting overseas currency profits or losses is not hedged and such profits or losses are converted into Sterling at average exchange rates throughout the period.
Currency loans and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates: this sensitivity can be analysed in comparison to period-end rates assuming all other variables remain constant as follows: 2008 2007 Income Income statement Equity statement Equity movement movement movement movement m m m m 10% movement in the Sterling Euro exchange rate 43.3 34.4 10% movement in the Sterling Swiss Franc exchange rate 44.7 38.4 Changes in the value of currency loans and foreign exchange contracts would not be expected to have an impact in the income statement, as they match currency assets, the value of which would rise or fall correspondingly, with fair value hedges assumed to remain fully effective.
The impact on equity of revaluations would be partially offset on consolidation by the revaluation of any net assets that are hedged by these borrowings and derivatives.
There is limited net asset offset on consolidation, for Swiss Franc loans and foreign exchange contracts, and the Groups exposure in reserves to changes in the value of the Swiss Franc is therefore more marked than for other currencies.

These floating rates are linked to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency.
Future cash flows arising from these financial instruments depend on interest periods agreed at the time of rollover.
Group policy permits the use of long-term interest rate derivatives in managing the risks associated with movements in interest rates, although the Group holds none of these products at present.
Since all cash, cash equivalents and borrowings are at floating rates of interest, no further disclosure on the effect of interest rate derivative products has been provided.
Cash and borrowings, as well as some foreign exchange products, are sensitive to movements in interest rates and such movements have been analysed in the chart below by calculating the effect on the income statement and equity of 1% movements in the interest rates for the currencies in which most Group cash and borrowings are denominated.
This analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the period-end positions prevail throughout the period, and therefore may not be representative of fluctuations in levels of borrowings.

Regular reports are made to the Audit Committee assessing current facilities and debt and, in the shorter term, weekly reports are circulated showing variances against the Groups cash flow budget.
Headroom is assessed based on historical experience as well as by assessing current business risks, including foreign exchange movements.
Maturity dates of existing facilities are spread over five years and therefore some refinancing risk is also mitigated: it is the Groups policy to refinance debt maturities significantly ahead of maturity dates.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows assuming that interest rates remain constant and that borrowings are paid in full in the year of maturity.

Debt, investments, foreign exchange and derivative transactions are all spread amongst a number of banks all of which have shortor long-term credit ratings appropriate to the Groups policies and exposures.
The investments made by the insurance companies, which hold the bulk of the Groups cash investments, are reviewed regularly by the appropriate boards and judged against existing investment policies and counterparty credit risk policies.
Trade receivables primarily comprise balances due from individual fixed line and mobile customers and balances due from network operators.
Network operators are generally major multi-national enterprises with whom the Group has well established relationships and are consequently not considered to add significantly to the Groups credit risk exposure.
Provision is made for any receivables that are considered to be irrecoverable.
