In addition, Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral exploitation of under-pit Reserves in certain areas is dependent on new Resources and Ore Reserves the JORC Code as published by the Joint methods of access and transportation which require more detailed Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and studies and costings.
The current mining Contract for Tur expires on 7 October SRK has reviewed the Companys GKZ reserve statements as prepared 2021.
The Reserves are based on a Life of Mine Plan to the end of 2017. in accordance with the local regulatory requirements of the Republic of The Resources will support operations continuing beyond 2017.

There has been an overall increase in Mineral In 2007, SRK prepared an independent mineral experts report MER Resources 132Mt and Ore Reserves 12Mt as a result of additional on the mining, processing, smelting and power generating assets of technical studies and exploration for Ushkatyn III underground, ENRC.
An abridged version of this MER was included in the prospectus Perstenevsky and Zapadny Zhomart Zhomart operations.

The MER contained Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve SRK has however undertaken sufficient work to demonstrate that the Statements in accordance with the JORC code, dated 1 July 2007.
Reserves are economic based on the assumed consensus market forecasts for the long-term prices of the various products.
In 2008, SRK carried out a desktop review of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, and provided an updated statement in line with the JORC The current mining Contract for Ushkatyn III expires in June 2015 and for Code, based on a review of the depletion of the Reserves from the Zhomart in June 2013.
The Reserves for the Zhairem deposit are based annual submissions to the state the 5GR forms, the actual production on a Life of Mine Plan to the end of 2024.

For 2009, considering the significant changes to commodity prices and Iron Ore Division SSGPO demand production profile for many of the products produced by ENRC, In 2008 SSGPO produced 37.8Mt of iron ore at 32.4% iron, from four this update has been carried out in significantly more detail than open pits and one underground mine.

The Reserves are based on an overall Life of Mine plan for 2008 review, form the basis for the current update.
The Resources can support operations continuing beyond 2040.
SRK have reviewed the Ore Reserve Statements in conjunction with the current consensus market forecasts, which in turn are derived from the Aluminium Division AoK median of long-term price assumptions as reported by various analysts In 2008 the two Divisions of AoK produced 5.2Mt of bauxite, 4.5Mt from during Q1 2009.
The consensus market forecasts used to support the 10 open pits in three areas of KBRU and 0.67Mt from three open pits of current Ore Reserve declarations are: TBRU.
All mining licences expire on 21 January 2017, with the exception of the mining licence for Vostochno-Ayatskoye which expires on 26 July Chromite at US$200 tonne and HCFeCr at US$0.80 lb.
SRK has declared the Reserves on the understanding that AoK Manganese concentrate products between US$56 and 193 tonne can extend these licences under similar terms for periods that match and iron concentrate products between US$25 and 36 tonne.
The Reserves are based on an overall Life of Iron ore at US$1.26 dmtu dry metric tonne units for pellets, Mine Plan for AoK to the end of 2041.
SRK notes that the economic and US$0.77 dmtu for concentrates.

Codes or guidelines similar to JORC with only minor regional variations have been adopted in South Africa, Canada, the United States, Chile, Europe and some other countries.
Together these represent current best practice for reporting ore reserves and mineral resources.
The JORC Code envisages the use of reasonable investment assumptions, including the use of projected long-term commodity prices, in calculating reserve estimates.
Ore Reserve and Mineral Resources information in the tables below is based on Ore Reserve and Mineral Statements of the individual entities as audited and re-stated as at 31 December 2008 in accordance with the JORC Code by SRK Consulting UK Ltd SRK.
The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resources estimate figures in the following tables are as of 31 December 2008.
Summary data for year-end 2007 are shown for comparison.
No significant changes with respect to the classification of the Mineral Reserve and Ore Resource have occurred in 2008.
Mineral Resources are inclusive of Ore Reserves.
