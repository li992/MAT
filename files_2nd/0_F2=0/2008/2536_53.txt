Pensions The Group principal pension scheme, the Britvic Pension Plan BPP, has both a defined benefit and a defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section of the BPP was closed on 1 August 2002, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join the defined contribution section of the BPP.
Following a 60 day employee consultation period that started on 4 February 2008, the Britvic Pension Plan changed with effect from 1 July 2008.
The key changes are detailed below.
Defined benefit section 1 The pension accrual rate reduced from 1 60 to 1 90 for each year of future service membership for employee members.
2 The pension accrual rate for Executive members was reduced proportionately by one third for each year of future service membership.
3 Increases to pensions in payment for pension earned for membership from 1 July 2008 are in line with the Retail Price Index up to 2.5% each year.
Defined contribution section 1 The Company contribution rate for future service was increased to 1.5 times employee contributions for employee members.
2 A proportionate increase for Executive members.
The changes have not had a material effect on Britvics future pension scheme obligations.
Contributions are paid into the Plan in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary and as outlined in the Schedule of Contributions.
The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2007 under the Scheme Specific Requirements and as a result, annual contributions of 10.0m in respect of the funding shortfall outlined in the Recovery Plan will continue to be made by 31 December in each of the years 20082010 in order to eliminate the funding deficit in the Plan.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the BPP defined contribution scheme in the income statement for 2008 was 2.0m 2007: 1.4m.
As a result of the acquisition of Britvic Ireland on 29 August 2007, in Northern Ireland the Group inherited a further pension scheme in which its employees at the date of the transfer participated, the C&C Pension Fund.
The name of this scheme has subsequently been changed to the Britvic Northern Ireland Pension Plan BNIPP, with employees of C&C Group transferring out on 30 June 2008.
The next actuarial valuation is due on 31 December 2008.
At present, the bulk transfer out of assets for the C&C employees has still to be finalised.
The BNIPP was closed to new members on 28 February 2006, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join a Stakeholder plan with Legal & General.
In the Republic of Ireland ROI, employees continued to participate in a number of C&C Group pension funds following the acquisition until transferring into two newly formed pension plans called the Britvic Ireland Defined Contribution Pension Plan and the Britvic Ireland Defined Benefit Pension Plan BIPP on 1 September 2008.
Both Plans are held under trust and operated by the Trustees of Britvic Ireland Pension Trust Limited.
Since 1 March 2006 under the previous C&C arrangements, and continuing under the new BIPP arrangements, new employees are offered membership of the defined contribution plan in the first instance, with the ability to transfer into the defined benefit plan after a period of five years.
The bulk transfer of assets to these new Plans in respect of members past service rights from the C&C arrangements are still to be finalised.
The next actuarial valuation will be carried out following the receipt of the bulk transfer of assets from the C&C pension arrangement.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the Irish defined contribution schemes in the Income Statement for 2008 was 0.1m 2007: nil.
All Group pension funds are administered by trustees and are independent of the Groups finances.
The assets and liabilities of the pension schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 28 September 2008 by Watson Wyatt BPP and Mercer BIPP and BNIPP.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate on assets assumption for the portfolio.
Demographic assumptions The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.
This is based on standard actuarial tables known as PA92.
An allowance for future improvements in longevity has also been included.
The following life expectancy assumptions have been used: 2008 2008 2007 2007 Years Years Years Years ROI GB ROI GB Current pensioners at age 65 males 20.7 19.9 19.0 19.9 Current pensioners at age 65 females 23.8 22.8 21.9 22.8 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 males 21.8 21.1 20.5 21.1 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 females 24.8 24.0 23.4 24.0 The mortality assumptions used to calculate the GB pension obligation were revised in 2007 following a mortality investigation carried out as part of the actuarial valuation of the Britvic Pension Plan at 31 March 2007.
The mortality assumptions for the ROI were reviewed by the actuary during the year and updated in light of the improvements experienced.
Sensitivities The value of plan assets is sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values.
Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the income statement and balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on GB plan liabilities Impact on ROI plan liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 7.8m Decrease increase by 1.0m Inflation rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 5.9m Increase decrease by 0.8m Mortality rate Increase in life expectancy by one year Increase by 12.1m Increase by 0.9m 84 Britvic plc Annual Report 2008 25.

The pension curtailment in the prior year is triggered by the transfer of Group employees under the outsourcing arrangements of the secondary distribution network.
Those employees that are members of the BPP will no longer accrue future entitlement, which gives rise to the curtailment gain.
