Diamonds Argyle Rio Tinto: 100 per cent The Diamonds group owns and operates the Argyle diamond mine in Western Australia.
Production from Argyles AK1 open pit mine is expected to continue through to 2011 after which the mine will transition to underground operations which are expected to extend the life of the mine to about 2018.
2008 operating performance The AK1 pit experienced a wall failure at the end of 2007, which significantly reduced ore volumes from the mine.
As a result, lower grade stockpiled ore was processed through the recovery plant.
Diamonds recovered decreased to 15.1 million carats in 2008 from 18.7 million carats in 2007.
With a planned slowdown in underground construction Argyle intends to operate the open pit mine through to 2011.
Mining will continue in the southern end of the pit to extract the remaining economic ore.
When the southern end of the pit is completedin 2009, mining is expected to move to the Northern Bowl and continue until ore is available from the underground mine.
With the diamond market severely impacted by the downturn in the US economy, the underground project has been slowed by reducing the project workforce.
