These include six offices in the US and offices in Shanghai and Beijing, PR China: Shin-Yokohama, Japan: Seoul, South Korea: Taipei, Taiwan: Kfar Saba, Israel: Paris, France: Munich, Germany and Bangalore, India.
Design offices are based in Cambridge, Maidenhead, Sheffield and Blackburn, UK: Sophia Antipolis and Grenoble, France: Leuven-Heverlee, Belgium: Aachen and Grasbrunn, Germany: Trondheim, Norway: Sentjernej, Slovenia: Lund, Sweden: Austin, Texas, Olympia, Washington and San Jose, California in the US and Bangalore, India.
More information about the business and key performance indicators are set out in the business review comprising the Chairmans statement on pages 2 and 3, the Chief Executive Officers review of operations on pages 5 to 8, the financial review on pages 11 to 15 and the corporate responsibility report on pages 26 and 27.
Future developments The Groups stated objective is to establish a global standard for its RISC architecture, physical IP and other products in the embedded microprocessor and semiconductor markets.
The directors believe that, in order to achieve this goal, it is important to expand the number and range of potential customers for its technology.
The Group intends to enter into licence agreements with new customers and to increase the range of new technology supplied to existing customers.
Relationships will continue to be established with third-party tools and software vendors to ensure that their products will operate with the Groups products.
As a result of its position in its industry, the Group is presented with many opportunities to acquire complementary technology or resources and it intends to continue to make appropriate acquisitions from time to time.
Going concern After dividend payments of 26.4 million and spending 40.3 million on the share buyback programme in 2008, the Group grew its cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities balance to 78.8 million at the end of 2008 from 51.3 million at the start of the year.
After reviewing the 2009 budget and longer-term plans, the directors are satisfied that, at the time of approving the financial statements, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of both the Group and the parent company.
Dividends The directors recommend a final dividend in respect of the year to 31 December 2008 of 1.32 pence per share which, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting AGM on 14 May 2009, will be paid on 20 May 2009 to shareholders on the register on 1 May 2009.
This final dividend, combined with the interim dividend of 0.88 pence per share paid during the year, makes a total of 2.2 pence per share for the year, an increase of 10% on the total dividend of 2.0 pence per share for 2007.
Share buyback programme In accordance with the rolling authority given by shareholders at the 2007 AGM, 41.2 million shares representing 3.1% of the issued share capital of 0.05 pence each were bought back by the Company in 2008 2007: 94.5 million shares at a total cost of 40.3 million 2007: 128.6 million.
In 2009 to date, no shares have been bought back, but the buyback programme remains in place and may be used during the year, if appropriate.
Research and development R&D R&D is of major importance and, as part of its research activities, the Group collaborates closely with universities worldwide and plans to continue its successful engagement with Michigan University.
Key areas of product development for 2009 include the development of further energy efficient, high-performance engines for both data and control applications such as ARM cores based on symmetric multiprocessor and superscalar technology.
The Group is investing in future physical IP development including low-power, low-leakage technologies for both bulk CMOS complementary metal oxide semiconductor and SOI silicon on insulator processes to ensure leadership in this market.
In addition, the Group will deliver development tools, graphics processors and fabric IP to enable its customers to design and programme systems-on-chip SoCs.
The Group incurred R&D expenses of 87.6 million in 2008, representing 29.3% of revenues, compared with 84.0 million in 2007.
R&D expenses have been charged to the income statement since the requirements for capitalisation were not met.
