Impairment The impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement, as a separate line within operating profit, in respect of goodwill and intangible assets relate exclusively to the Wyatt Media Group AB Wyatt and its subsidiary companies.
During the year ended 31 December 2008, the goodwill and intangible assets in respect of the Groups online media operations was impaired by 17,458 thousand and 4,527 thousand respectively.
This was triggered by significant intensification of market competition primarily in the social networking environment, which now offers free content and membership and increasing obsolescence of existing coding and software causing a significant pre-tax risk adjustment which has triggered the impairment charge.
At 31 December 2008 there is no goodwill or intangibles in relation to Wyatt remaining.
There was no impairment for the year ended 31 December 2007.
