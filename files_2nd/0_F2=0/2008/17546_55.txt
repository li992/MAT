The consolidated financial information of the Yell Group consolidates the financial results of Publicom SA for the twelve months ended 31 March 2008.
It is estimated that Group revenue to 31 March 2008 was increased by approximately 13.4 million, Group EBITDA was increased by approximately 4.9 million and profit after taxation by approximately 2.3 million.
The activities of Publicom SA were integrated into our other Argentine interests at the end of 2007.
On 26 September 2007, we reached agreement with the minority shareholders to acquire their remaining 1.28% of the share capital of Yell Publicidad for 40.4 million 27.8 million, including expenses of 1.0 million 0.7 million.
In the USA the activities of the six acquisitions have all been integrated into the parent company, Yellow Book Inc, and its results are incorporated into the Groups reported results.
The timing of the distribution of the acquirees directories means that it is not possible to determine the exact contribution they made to the Groups reported results nor what they would have contributed if they had been owned for the entire period.
However, it is estimated that Group revenues were increased by 7.8 million during the period of ownership and if the acquirees had been owned for the whole period that revenues would have have been increased by 13.0 million.
Group EBITDA is estimated to have increased by 2.0 million during the period of ownership and would have increased by 5.3 million for the whole year.
Operating profit of the acquirees would not have been materially different to EBITDA and the profit after tax not less than 1.3 million during the period of ownership and 3.7 million for the whole year.
Acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 2007 In the year ended 31 March 2007, the Yell Group paid 2,039.2 million for acquisitions.
The largest acquisition was that of 94.25% of the share capital of Telefnica Publicidad e Informacin, S. A. TPI for 2,939.8 million 2,010.3 million.

Directories in development comprise all current intangible assets, including customer commitments and a customer database.
Goodwill of 1,925.0 million 1,316.4 million is attributable to the future synergies expected, the workforce acquired and future growth of the business.
The acquisition of TPI now renamed Yell Publicidad was financed by debt acquired of 1,634.0 million, proceeds from the share placement of 344.8 million, and operating cash of 31.5 million.
The consolidated financial information of the Yell Group consolidates the financial results of Yell Publicidad for the eight months ended 31 March 2007.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2006, we estimate that the pro forma Group revenue to 31 March 2007 would have been 2,206.8 million and Group adjusted EBITDA would have been 708.7 million.
On 28 March 2007, we purchased a further 16,136,315 shares of Yell Publicidad for 137.5 93.6 million, representing a further 4.47% of the share capital, resulting in ownership of 98.72% of the issued share capital.
On 2 April 2007, Yell Publicidad formally delisted its remaining outstanding shares.
This purchase was accounted for using the economic entity method whereby any excess of consideration over the Groups share of net assets is an adjustment to equity rather than goodwill.
We made a number of acquisitions in the US that are not considered material for separate presentation.
We paid cash of $55.9 million 28.9 million to acquire operations with net assets of $9.3 million 4.8 million to record goodwill of $46.6 million 24.1 million and other intangible assets of $15.0 million 7.8 million.
