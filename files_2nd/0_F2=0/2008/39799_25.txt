Notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, IFRIC Interpretations, and the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
In addition, the Group has also followed best practice recommendations issued by the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA as appropriate.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
This is discussed in the Financial Review.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present a separate income statement for the Parent Company.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of properties, available-for-sale investments and financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
These financial statements are presented in sterling since that is the currency in which the majority of the Groups transactions are denominated.
Management believes that the judgements, estimates and associated assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable, however actual results may differ from these estimates.
Critical judgements, where made, are disclosed within the relevant section of the financial statements to which such judgements have been applied.
The key estimates and assumptions relate to the property valuations applied by the Groups property valuers, the actuarial assumptions used in calculating the Groups retirement benefit obligations, valuation of share options granted under share-based payment schemes and in the determination of the valuation of available-for-sale investments, and are described in more detail in the accounting policy notes below, or the applicable note to the financial statements.
During 2008, the following accounting standards and guidance became effective and were adopted by the Group: IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions: and IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The following published standards and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and in some cases have not been adopted by the EU have not been adopted early by the Group: IAS 39 amended IFRS 7 amended, Reclassification of Financial Instruments Reclassification of Financial Assets: Effective Date and Transition: IFRS 1 amended IAS 27 amended, Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate: IFRS 2 amended, Share-based Payments Vesting Conditions and Cancellations: IFRS 3 revised 2008, Business Combinations: IFRS 8, Operating Segments: IAS 1 revised 2007, Presentation of Financial Statements: IAS 23 revised 2007, Borrowing Costs: IAS 27 revised 2008, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: IAS 39 amended, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items: IFRIC 15, Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate: IFRIC 16, Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation: IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners: IFRIC 18, Transfer of Assets from Customers: and Improvements to IFRSs May 2008.
It is not expected that these will have any significant future impact on the Groups accounts, except for: potential changes to segment disclosures when IFRS 8 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009: and an amendment to IAS 40 Investment Property Improvements to IFRSs May 2008.
All investment property in the course of construction will be recognised in investment property and measured at fair value through the income statement.
Currently, properties acquired to be developed for future use as investment properties are treated as development property.
Any fair value movements for such properties are recorded directly in the revaluation reserve, rather than through the income statement.
It is not possible to estimate the impact that this is expected to have on the Groups financial statements when the amendment is adopted.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and the Group, plus the Groups share of the results and net assets of the joint ventures.
The Company holds investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost.
A joint venture is a contract under which the Group and other parties undertake an activity or invest in an entity, under joint control.
The Group uses equity accounting for such entities, carrying its investment at cost plus the movement in the Groups share of net assets after acquisition, less impairment.
Presentation of Group income statement The Group income statement has been presented by analysing the results into three columns: Adjusted income and expense, Adjustments and Total income and expense.
In addition, the results of the property joint ventures have been included immediately after net property rental income and profit on sale of trading properties.
This differs from the normal position set out in IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, so as to reflect the property income of the Group together within the Group income statement.
Annual Report 2008 SEGRO plc Notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling on the transaction date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settling these, or from retranslating monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies, are booked in the Group income statement.
The exception is for foreign currency loans that hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in equity until the investment is realised.
Consolidation of foreign entities Assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Their income, expenses and cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period or at spot rate for significant items.
Resultant exchange differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the income statement when the operation is sold.
Investment properties These properties comprise freehold and leasehold properties and are first measured at cost including transaction costs, then revalued to market value at each reporting date by professional valuers.
Leasehold properties are shown gross of the leasehold payables which are accounted for as finance lease obligations.
Valuation gains and losses in a period are taken to the income statement, and then reclassified to revaluation reserves until realisation on the sale of the property.
As the Group uses the fair value model as per IAS 40, no depreciation is provided.
Development properties These comprise properties acquired to be developed for future use as investment properties, as well as completed properties occupied by Group entities, and are initially measured at cost including capitalised interest where applicable.
Development properties are fair valued on the same basis as investment properties with revaluation movements being booked in the revaluation reserve through the statement of recognised income and expense, with deficits below cost taken to the income statement.
Subsequent revaluation gains are taken to the income statement, but only to the extent of cumulative net deficits previously charged to the income statement.
Trading properties These are properties developed and held for sale, and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct expenditure and capitalised interest.
Property purchases and sales Property purchases and sales are recognised on the date of unconditional exchange, or, where exchange is conditional, on the date that the conditions have been satisfied.
Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee, are classified as finance leases.
All others are deemed operating leases.
Under operating leases, properties leased to tenants are accounted for as investment properties.
In cases where only the buildings part of a property lease qualifies as a finance lease, the land is shown as an investment property.
Revenue Revenue includes rent, income from service charges and proceeds from the sale of trading properties.
Rental income This includes net income from managed operations.
Rentals from properties let as operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives and initial costs to arrange leases are capitalised, then amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
For properties let as finance leases, minimum lease receipts are apportioned between finance income and principal repayment, but receipts that were not fixed at lease inception e. g. rent review rises, are booked as income when earned.
Surrender premiums received in the period are included in rental income.
Service charges and other recoveries from tenants These include income in relation to service charges, directly recoverable expenditure and management fees.
Revenue from services is recognised by reference to the state of completion of the relevant services provided at the reporting date.
Financial Instruments Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.
Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing.
Interest is capitalised as from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
Significant accounting policies continued Financial Instruments continued Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivatives especially interest rate swaps in managing interest rate risk, and does not use them for trading.
They are recorded, and subsequently revalued, at fair value, with revaluation gains or losses being immediately taken to the income statement.
The exception is for derivatives qualifying as hedges, when the treatment of the gain loss depends upon the item being hedged.
None of the Groups interest rate derivatives qualify as a hedge.
However, there are USD and euro forward currency sales that have been designated as effective net investment hedges.
Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables are booked at fair value.
An impairment provision is created where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect in full.
Trade and other payables are stated at cost, since cost is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Available-for-sale AFS investments AFS investments are initially measured at cost, and then revalued to market value based on quarterly reports received from the fund manager, or other market evidence where publicly traded.
Gains and losses arising from valuation are taken to equity, and then recycled through the income statement on realisation.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, any cumulative loss recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Pensions Defined benefit schemes The schemes assets are measured at fair value, their obligations are calculated at discounted present value, and any net surplus or deficit is recognised in the balance sheet.
Operating and financing costs are charged to the income statement, with service costs spread systematically over employees working lives, and financing costs expensed in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised through equity in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Where the actuarial valuation of the scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognisable asset is limited to that for which the Group can benefit in the future.
Professional actuaries are used in relation to defined benefit schemes and the assumptions made are outlined in note 22.
Share-based payments The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is recognised in the income statement at their fair value at grant date.
They are expensed straight-line over the vesting period, based on estimates of the shares or options that will eventually vest.
Charges are reversed if it appears that performance will not be met.
Options are valued using the Black-Scholes model.

Annual Report 2008 SEGRO plc Notes to the financial statements 13.
Properties continued 13 i Total property assets, including joint ventures continued Investment, development and owner occupied properties were externally valued as at 31 December 2008 by CB Richard Ellis, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, Colliers CRE or King Sturge.
The valuation basis is market value, conforms to international valuation standards and was arrived at by reference to market evidence of the transaction prices paid for similar properties.
In relation to the property valuations applied by the Groups independent, professionally qualified property valuers, the current volatility in the global financial system has created a significant degree of turbulence in commercial real estate markets across the world and the lack of liquidity in the capital markets means that it may be very difficult to achieve a sale of property assets in the short-term.
Therefore, the property valuers are of the opinion that abnormal market conditions currently prevail and that there is likely to be a greater than usual degree of uncertainty in respect of the property valuation figures now reported.
Until the number and consistency of comparable transactions increases, this situation is likely to remain.
The value of the Groups portfolio is affected by the prevailing market and economic conditions and thus the Groups net asset value can increase or decrease due to external factors outside of the Groups control.
However, the Group has a diverse portfolio spread across ten countries in Europe and it is anticipated that this should help to mitigate the impact of current market and economic conditions on the Group.
All the valuers listed above are qualified independent valuers who hold a recognised and relevant professional qualification and have recent experience in the relevant location and the category of properties being valued.
All the valuers have adopted policies for the regular rotation of the responsible valuer.
CB Richard Ellis, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, Colliers CRE and King Sturge also undertake some professional and letting work on behalf of the Group, although this is limited in relation to the activities of the Group as a whole.
All four firms advise us that the total fees paid by the Group represent less than 5 per cent of their total revenue in any year.

Financial instruments and fair values Categories of financial instruments Financial assets in the Group comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, some of which are categorised as derivatives designated as fair value through the income statement non hedge, and other forward foreign exchange contracts which are classified as derivatives designated as hedges.
Financial assets also include finance lease receivables, trade and other receivables, availablefor-sale investments and cash and cash equivalents, which are all classified as other financial assets.
Financial liabilities in the Group comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, some of which are categorised as derivatives designated as fair value through the income statement non hedge and other forward foreign exchange contracts which are classified as derivatives designated as hedges.
Financial liabilities also include secured bank loans, unsecured bond issues, unsecured loan notes, bank loans and overdrafts and preference shares, all of which are categorised as debt at amortised cost, and trade and other payables, provisions and current tax liabilities, which are classified as other financial liabilities.
The carrying values of these financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value, with the exception of unsecured bond issues, secured bank loans and unsecured loan notes.
At 31 December 2008 the fair value of 1,286.3 million of unsecured bond issues was 875.8 million 2007 1,285.5 million compared to 1,238.7 million fair value, the fair value of 108.8 million of secured bank loans was 109.2 million 2007 80.2 million compared to 80.2 million fair value and the fair value of 52.8 million of unsecured loans was 53.9 million 2007 36.8 million compared to 38.7 million fair value.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to the quoted market prices.
Financial guarantees are issued by the Parent entity to support bank borrowings of 100 per cent owned subsidiary companies domiciled overseas.
The face value of these borrowings is already included in the Group balance sheet.
As the borrowing entity will have unencumbered directly owned property assets exceeding the value of the guaranteed borrowings the probability of the Parent entity having to recognise any loss in respect to these guarantees is considered to be highly unlikely.
Hence no fair value liability has been ascribed to these guarantees in the accounts of the Parent entity.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns and as such it aims to maintain a prudent mix between debt and equity financing.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 23 to 26.
Debt primarily comprises long-term debt issues and drawings against medium-term committed revolving credit facilities from banks as disclosed in note 18.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Foreign currency risk management The Group does not have any regular transactional foreign currency exposures as it does not have any regular business involving cross border currency flows.
However, it does have operations in Europe which transact business denominated mostly in euros.
Hence there is currency exposure caused by translating the local trading performance and local net assets into sterling for each financial period and at each balance sheet date.
The Groups approach to managing balance sheet translation exposure is described in the Foreign Currency Translation Exposure section in the Financial Review on page 52.
Annual Report 2008 SEGRO plc Notes to the financial statements 19.
Financial instruments and fair values continued Foreign currency risk management continued The Groups balance sheet translation exposure is summarised below: 2008 2007 Euros US dollars Total Euros US dollars Total Group m m m m m m Gross currency assets 2,054.9 35.7 2,090.6 1,502.6 225.2 1,727.8 Gross currency liabilities 1,791.0 27.6 1,818.6 1,287.9 218.8 1,506.7 Net exposure 263.9 8.1 272.0 214.7 6.4 221.1 Company Gross currency assets 433.5 433.5 328.5 214.0 542.5 Gross currency liabilities 859.6 27.6 887.2 476.2 218.8 695.0 Net exposure 426.1 27.6 453.7 147.7 4.8 152.5 2008 gross currency liabilities include EUR455.7 million 434.0 million and USD40.3 million 27.6 million designated as net investment hedges.
2007 gross currency liabilities include EUR200.0 million 147.0 million designated as a net investment hedge.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups main currency exposure is the euro.
The blended sensitivity of the net assets of the Group to a 10 per cent change in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies is 30.2 million 2007 27.1 million, with a sensitivity of 29.3 million against the euro 2007 25.5 million and 0.9 million against the US dollar 2007 1.6 million.
For the Company, the blended sensitivity is 50.4 million 2007 17.5 million with a sensitivity of 47.3 million against the euro 2007 17.0 million and 3.1 million against the US dollar 2007 0.5 million.
Forward foreign exchange contracts In the current year, the Group has entered into various forward sales and currency swap contracts.
Some of these are designated as net investment hedges, and hedge accounted.
The others are effectively cash flow hedges, using the surplus cash in one currency to temporarily fund paying off debt in another currency.
These have not been designated as hedges and as a consequence their change in fair value is taken through the income statement.
The following table details the forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding as at the year end: Average Currency contract exchange rates local currency Contract value Fair value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 rate rate m m m m m m Group Cash flow hedges Sell euros buy sterling 1.20 1.41 242.7 267.1 231.1 196.4 28.0 7.2 Sell euros buy US dollars 1.42 60.2 44.3 1.3 Net investment hedges Sell euros buy sterling 1.23 1.38 209.7 200.0 199.8 147.1 29.1 1.8 Sell US dollars buy sterling 1.45 25.0 17.1 0.1 57.0 10.3 Company Cash flow hedges Sell euros buy sterling 1.21 1.41 452.4 467.1 430.9 343.5 57.1 9.0 Sell euros buy US dollars 1.42 60.2 44.3 1.3 Sell US dollars buy sterling 1.45 25.0 17.1 0.1 57.0 10.3 99.
Financial instruments and fair values continued Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The current Group policy states that around 85 per cent of gross borrowings should be at fixed rate provided by long-term debt issues attracting a fixed coupon or from floating rate bank borrowings converted into fixed rate or hedged via interest rate swaps, forwards, caps, collars or floors or options on these products.
Hedging activities require the approval of the Treasury Risk Committee and are evaluated and reported on regularly to ensure that the policy is being adhered to.
The Group Board reviews the policy on interest rate exposure annually with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1 per cent increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2008 would decrease increase by 3.0 million 2007 decrease increase by 3.1 million.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits.
Fixed rate debt issues are held at amortised cost and are not re-valued in the balance sheet to reflect interest rate movements.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Economic cash flow hedges Outstanding pay fixed, receive floating contracts are as follows: Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % m m m m Group In one year or less 3.2 6.3 0.1 In more than one year but less than two 4.4 212.4 4.7 In more than two years but less than five 3.9 4.0 761.9 568.3 30.2 4.1 Total 974.3 574.6 34.9 4.2 Company In one year or less 4.3 123.8 2.3 In more than two years but less than five 4.0 4.1 423.8 423.0 19.2 1.5 Total 547.6 423.0 21.5 1.5 The above are effective economic hedges although the Group has not elected to adopt hedge accounting for them.
Hence their change in fair value is taken direct to the income statement rather than to other equity.
The interest rate swaps settle on either a 3 month or 6 month basis with the floating rate side based on the EURIBOR rate for the relevant period.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
Financial instruments and fair values continued Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the lease portfolio to either business sector or individual company as the Group has a well spread diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than 5 per cent of rental income.
Trade receivables which include unpaid rent and amounts receivable in respect of property disposals were approximately 1 per cent of total assets at 31 December 2008 and at 31 December 2007.
The Directors are of the opinion that the credit risk associated with unpaid rent is low.
In excess of 95 per cent of rent due is generally collected within 21 days of the due date.
Investment in financial instruments is restricted to short-term liquid funds with a good credit rating.
Derivative financial instruments are transacted via ISDA agreements with counterparties with a good investment grade credit rating.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by having a policy that requires adequate cash and committed bank facilities remain available to cover and match all debt maturities, development spend, trade related and corporate cash flows forward over a rolling 12 month period.
This is achieved by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk management is discussed in more detail in the Liquidity Position and Going Concern sections in the Financial Review on pages 52 and 53.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity profile for its financial instruments.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.

Retirement benefit schemes Background The Group has two defined benefit schemes in the UK, the Slough Estates 1957 Pension Scheme the Slough scheme and the Bilton Group Pension Scheme the Bilton scheme.
Their assets are held by Trustees separately from the assets of the employer.
The Bilton scheme was closed to new members from 2003, and the Slough scheme from October 2005.
Valuation of the Slough and Bilton schemes has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2007 for Slough and 5 April 2007 for Bilton and updated by the independent actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2008.
The Company has an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme UURBS for one employee, the Chief Executive.
This arrangement is a defined benefit scheme in nature.
The calculation of the value of this unapproved benefit promise uses assumptions which are consistent with those used for the Slough scheme.
There are no assets supporting this UURBS.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes in the UK and Continental Europe.

Asset class returns are based on a forward looking building block approach.
Equity returns are developed based on the selection of an equity risk premium above the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with the yields on government bonds.
Returns on property are assumed to be 1 per cent per annum lower than those on equities.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes holdings of these instruments.
