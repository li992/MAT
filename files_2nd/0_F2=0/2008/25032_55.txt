Financial instruments continued Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the Nature and extent of risks arising from Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
financial instruments Management of market risk The principal activities of the Group outlined in the Directors Report Market risk is managed on a Group-wide basis.
The Groups give rise to exposure to financial risks in the ordinary course of products can be divided into two groups: those which relate to a business.

The Groups revenue model for each of these control and risk management and approving any changes to the product groups is set out below.
Groups risk management policy which materially increases the risk profile of the Group.
Limits as to the acceptable level of risk are The Group does not take proprietary positions based on an established and regularly reviewed by the Board.

The Group has a formal risk policy which includes limits, or a methodology for setting limits, for every single financial market The Groups finance department, headed by the Finance Director, which the Group trades, as well as certain groups of markets which who is responsible to the Board, comprises risk management, the directors consider to be correlated.
These limits determine the financial planning, financial control and credit departments, which net exposure arising from client activity and hedging which the are responsible for the operation of the Groups controls in these Group is prepared to carry.
The Groups exposure monitor allows it to areas.
The risk management department reports daily to the Groups continually monitor its exposure against these limits.

The objective of the risk department is to exposure exceeds these limits, the policy requires that sufficient manage the Groups financial risk and to minimise the effects of hedging is carried out to bring the exposure back within the defined fluctuations in financial markets on the value of the Groups financial limit or, if the market is closed, as soon as it re-opens.

IG Group Holdings plc 82 Report and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements at 31 May 2008 30.
Financial instruments continued Market risk continued Sports spread bets and binary bets are difficult or not cost-effective to hedge and there is often no direct underlying market which can be utilised in setting the price which the Group quotes.
The Group normally undertakes no hedging for these markets but can lay off large positions if considered necessary.
The directors aim to reduce the volatility of revenue from these markets by offering a large number of different betting opportunities, the results of which should, to some extent, offset each other irrespective of the underlying market outcome.
The overwhelmingly short-term nature of these bets means that risk on these markets at any point in time is not considered to be significant.
Exposure to market risk The Group has exposure to market risk to the extent that it has a residual un-hedged position.
The Groups exposure to market risk at any point in time depends primarily on short-term market conditions and client activities during the trading day.
The exposure at each balance sheet date is therefore not considered representative of the market risk exposure faced by the Group over the year.
The Groups exposure to market risk is determined by the exposure limits described above which change from time to time.
The most significant market risk faced by the Group is on equity positions including shares and indices which are highly correlated and managed on a portfolio basis.
Other exposures, including foreign exchange, commodities and interest rates do not give rise to significant market risk.
The equity exposure at the balance sheet date and details of the exposure limit at the year end and for the year then ended is as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Equity exposure at year end 12,920 10,015 Equity exposure limit at year end 15,000 15,000 Average equity exposure limit for the year 15,000 13,750 The Group has no significant concentration of market risk.
Sensitivity analysis The following sensitivity analysis shows the potential impact of large moves in equity markets on revenue.
The percentage applied is based upon the Groups assessment of movements in equity markets and the percentages applied are considered to represent single day market falls that are reasonably possible.
Equity Market Potential exposures movement revenue 2008 applied impact 000 % 000 Equities 12,920 5% 646 The Groups average daily gain from financial instruments classified as held for trading was 504,000 2007 - 334,000 and therefore the potential revenue impact shown above represents 1.3 days trading.
Reasonably possible movements in other markets have no significant impact on the Groups revenue.
Changes in risk variables have no direct impact on the Groups equity as the Group has no financial instruments classified as available for sale, or designated in hedging relationships.
IG Group Holdings plc Notes to the Financial Statements at 31 May 2008 Report and Financial Statements 2008 83 30.
Financial instruments continued Market risk continued Foreign currency risk Foreign currency exposures arise in the normal course of business and the management of this risk forms part of the risk policies outlined above.
Limits on the exposures which the Group will accept in each currency are set by the Risk Committee and the Group hedges its exposures as necessary with market counterparties.
Foreign currency risk is managed on a Group-wide basis, while the Companys exposure to foreign currency risk is not considered by the directors to be significant.
The functional currency of each company in the Group is that denominated by the country of incorporation as disclosed in note 15.
The Groups currency exposures are measured and managed in Sterling.
The Groups exposure monitor measures foreign currency risks including currency balance sheet exposures, equity, commodity, interest and other positions denominated in foreign currencies and bets and trades on foreign currencies.
The Groups net exposure to foreign exchange risk based on notional amounts at each balance sheet date was as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 USD 12,548 8,155 EUR 8,074 707 AUD 313 376 Other 7,506 3,367 No sensitivity analysis is presented for foreign exchange risk as the impact of reasonably possible market movements on the Groups revenue and equity are immaterial.
Interest rate risk The Group has interest rate risk arising from its trading activities which is hedged as part of the overall market risk management.
The Group offers bets and contracts for difference CFDs on interest rate derivatives and hedges its exposure using exchange traded futures and options.
Exposure limits are set by the Risk Committee for each product, and also for groups of products where it is considered that their price movements are likely to be positively correlated.
Interest rate risk arising from trading activities is not considered to be significant by the directors and is measured by the Groups exposure monitor on a Group wide basis.
The Group also has interest rate risk relating to financial instruments not at fair value through profit and loss such as cash held with banks which are not included in the Groups exposure monitor.
These exposures are not significant and are not hedged.
IG Group Holdings plc 84 Report and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements at 31 May 2008 30.
Financial instruments continued Market risk continued The interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date was as follows: Group W ithin 1 year More than 5 years Total 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate Redeemable preference shares 8% 40 40 40 40 Floating rate Trade receivables 263,323 352,628 263,323 352,628 Trade payables 582,689 726,144 582,689 726,144 Cash and cash equivalents 471,722 484,556 471,722 484,556 152,356 111,040 40 40 152,316 111,000 Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Trade receivables and payables include client and broker balances upon which interest is paid or received based upon market rates.
Cash and cash equivalents includes client money equivalent to the amount included with trade payables.
Other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
No sensitivity analysis is presented for interest rate risk as the impact of reasonably possible market movements on the Groups revenue and equity are immaterial.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation.
Management of credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group-wide basis.
The Group has credit exposure to the banks with which it deposits funds and the market counterparties with which it hedges.
The Group sets limits for its maximum exposure to each market counterparty and bank to which it has credit exposure.
Certain balances with brokers are held in segregated accounts with banks.
Clients are permitted to deal in circumstances where they may be capable of suffering losses greater than the funds they have on their account, or in limited circumstances are allowed credit.
The Group has a formal credit policy which determines the financial and experience criteria which a client must satisfy before being given an account which exposes the Group to credit risk, including trading limits for each client and strict margining rules.
The Group accepts collateral from clients in the form of shares or other securities which mitigate credit risk and all such assets are individually assessed and discounted for expected market risk.
IG Group Holdings plc Notes to the Financial Statements at 31 May 2008 Report and Financial Statements 2008 85 30.
Financial instruments continued Credit risk continued Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements such as personal guarantees.
The maximum exposures to credit risk at the reporting date was: Group Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 471,722 484,556 46 607 Trade receivables due from brokers 252,522 345,076 Trade receivables due from clients 10,801 7,552 735,045 837,184 46 607 The fair value of collateral held at 31 May 2008 against amounts due from clients was 4,521,000 2007 - 10,727,000.
The Groups largest credit exposure to any one individual broker at 31 May 2008 was 71,614,000, or 28% of the exposure to all brokers 2007 - 108,000,000, 31%.
The Groups largest credit exposure to any bank at 31 May 2008 was 125,189,000, or 27% of the exposure to all banks 2007 - 148,000,000, 31%.
The Group has no significant exposure to any one particular client.
The balance of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables due from brokers, will fluctuate over the course of the reporting period.
The tables below presents further detail on the Groups and the Companys exposure to credit risk.
External credit ratings Moodys long term ratings or equivalent are available for exposures to brokers and banks, and these are shown below.
No external credit rating of clients is available and therefore the balances are unrated.
Amounts due from clients are considered past due from the date that positions are closed and are aged from that date.
If debtors arise on open positions the amounts due from clients are considered neither past due nor impaired unless impairment is provided.
IG Group Holdings plc 86 Report and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements at 31 May 2008 30.
Financial instruments continued Credit risk continued The Group records specific impairments of trade receivables due from clients in a separate allowance account.
Impairments are recorded where the Group determines that it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts owing according to the contractual terms of the agreement.
There are no collective impairments taken, and no other assets are considered impaired.
Below is a reconciliation of changes in the separate allowance account during the period: 2008 2007 000 000 Balance at 1 June 2,849 2,069 Impairment loss for the year - charge for the year 4,478 2,064 - recoveries 453 387 Write-offs 1,010 897 Balance at 31 May 5,864 2,849 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations arising from its financial liabilities.
Management of liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed centrally for the whole Group by the Risk department.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its broker margin requirements and liabilities when due, under both normal circumstances and stressed conditions.
In order to monitor and manage this risk, the Groups Risk Department records the available funds daily and undertakes monthly liquidity stress testing.
The liquidity testing simulates what would happen to the Groups cash resources should there be a large single market fall and a sequential three day market fall.
This testing requires a number of assumptions regarding the impact of large market moves on client and broker positions and balances and the resulting behaviour of clients and brokers in terms of maintaining or closing positions and settling margin requirements.
There were no changes in the management of liquidity risk during the year.
Exposure to liquidity risk Positions can be closed at any time by clients and can also be closed by the Group, in accordance with the Groups margining rules.
If after closing a position a client is in surplus, then the amount owing is repayable on demand by the Group.
When client positions are closed, corresponding positions relating to the hedged position are closed with brokers.
Accordingly the Group releases cash margin, which is repaid by brokers to the Group on demand.
In the event of a significant movement in world markets, IG could have a short-term funding requirement to meet its payment obligations to market counterparties or winning clients before payment would be received from losing clients.
Any failure by IG to meet its payment obligations could result in market counterparties closing IGs hedge positions which would have materially adverse consequences for the Groups business.
The key measure used by the Group for managing liquidity risk is the level of working capital.
For this purpose working capital is the net of all trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and trade payables.
Working capital at the balance sheet date was as follows: IG Group Holdings plc 88 Report and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements at 31 May 2008 30.
Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk continued 2008 2007 000 000 Amounts due from brokers 252,522 345,076 Amounts due from clients 10,801 7,552 Cash and cash equivalents 471,722 484,556 Trade payables 582,689 726,144 152,356 111,040 The Groups liquidity risk under stressed conditions is mitigated by its committed bank facilities which amounted to 160.0m 2007 - 80.0m at the year end.
In the directors opinion the Group has sufficient funds available to meet all operational requirements in the event of a large market movement.
Liquidity management is also dependent on credit risk management described above.
Residual contractual maturities of financial liabilities The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, excluding estimated interest payments.
Given the nature of trade payables representing liabilities to clients in respect of trading margin deposited, unrealised profits on open positions and surpluses held on account and the fact that open positions can be closed immediately, trade payables are presented in the table below as on demand.

The directors are responsible for managing operational risk and have identified the following risks which are considered significant to the Group.
Technology The Groups operations are highly dependent on technology and advanced information systems.
Its ability to provide its clients with reliable, real-time access to its systems is fundamental to the success of the business.
Such dependency upon technology exposes the Group to significant risk in the event that such technology or systems experience any form of damage, interruption or failure.
The Group has business continuity procedures and policies in place which are designed to allow the Group to continue trading in its core markets and its systems are designed to mitigate the risk of failure of any component.
IG Group Holdings plc Notes to the Financial Statements at 31 May 2008 Report and Financial Statements 2008 89 30.
Financial instruments continued Operational risk continued Where the Group is dependent upon providers of data, market information, telephone and internet connectivity, the Group mitigates against the risk of failure of any of these suppliers by ensuring that where possible multiple providers and data routes are utilised.
To remain competitive, the Group must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, accessibility and other features of its software, network distribution systems and technologies.
Regulation The Groups spread betting, CFD and foreign exchange businesses are regulated in a number of jurisdictions.
In addition, two of the Groups subsidiaries are subject to regulation as licensed bookmakers by the Gambling Commission.
The Group is also subject to various regulation and legislation relating to technology, the provision of internet services and the use of the internet.
These regulatory frameworks impose restrictions on certain of the Groups activities and resources which place constraints on the Group operations and development.
The regulatory environment is regularly changing and imposes significant demands on the resources of the Group.
As the Groups activities expand, offering new products and penetrating new markets, these regulatory demands will inevitably increase.
The increasing complexity of the Groups operations require training and recruitment be tailored to meet these regulatory demands and the costs of compliance are expected to increase.
Capital management Regulatory capital The Groups lead regulator is the Financial Services Authority FSA.
Two of the Groups UK operating subsidiaries are regulated by the FSA which imposes a minimum level of regulatory capital which must be retained by each company and also an overall level of regulatory capital which must be maintained by the Group.
Given the Groups recent strong growth, profits have been and continue to be the primary source of new capital.
The Group is highly cash generative and plans to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 60% of earnings.
Capital resources are largely comprised of share capital and reserves, net of intangible assets and treasury shares.
Capital requirements are derived from credit risk, operational risk, counterparty risk and market risk considerations.
Capital resources, capital requirements and surplus capital at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Group Capital resources 127,480 94,638 Capital requirements 60,893 50,332 Surplus capital resources 66,587 44,306 Certain of the Groups subsidiaries are also regulated by a number of other regulators in overseas jurisdictions.
There have been no material changes in the Groups management of capital during the year.
