Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and overview of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board has established a Risk Committee which meets four times a year and is responsible for developing and monitoring the Groups risk management policies.
The Committee reports regularly to the Board in relation to its activities.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risks limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
This function is currently outsourced to Grant Thornton UK LLP.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management control and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the potential financial loss if a tenant or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
It relates principally to the Groups receivables from tenants and other third parties.
Counterparties to financial instruments all have at least an AArating by Standard & Poors.
Non-current receivable In 2007, the Company took the strategic decision to invest in a corporate loan to a private company in order to advance the strength of the Groups position in relation to one of its own properties.
The Company paid 53.2m plus legal costs and arrangement fees for the loan which has a maximum term of 16 years but can be repaid in full or in part at the issuers option at any time.
Interest is payable on the roll-over dates at LIBOR plus 2.5%.
The borrower has met all its interest payments to date and has repaid capital of 7,851,000 in 2006 07 and 2,362,000 in 2007 08.
The loan is secured on a property asset with a commercially acceptable loan to value ratio.
Whilst the loan represents a concentration of risk in a single counterparty, the Group has no reason to believe that it will not be repaid in full.
Trade and other receivables The Groups activities are focused exclusively in Great Britain and the Channel Islands and within this geographical area, its exposure to credit risk arising from trade and other receivables is influenced by the individual characteristics of each tenant.
As at 31 March 2008, the Groups 20 largest tenants within its directly held properties and its joint ventures accounted for 36.0% 2007: 41.5% of the passing rents from these properties.
The Group operates a policy whereby the creditworthiness of each tenant is assessed prior to lease or pre-lease terms being agreed.
The process includes seeking external ratings where available and reviewing financial information in the public domain.
In certain cases, the Group will require collateral to support these lease obligations.
This usually takes the form of a rent deposit, parent company guarantee or a bank guarantee.
Rent collection is outsourced to managing agents who report regularly on payment performance and provide the Group with intelligence on the continuing financial viability of tenants.
Arrears are monitored internally on a weekly basis by the internal property management teams and a strategy for dealing with significant potential defaults is presented on a timely basis by the Head of the Investment Portfolio or the property managers of the Groups various joint ventures to the weekly meeting of the Executive Directors.
