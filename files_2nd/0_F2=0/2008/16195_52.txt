Provisions i Decommissioning costs 2007 2008 as restated 000 000 At 1 January as restated 135,139 124,868 New provisions and changes in estimates 9,987 7,252 Disposal of subsidiaries note 26 37,916 Decommissioning payments 194 5,065 Unwinding of discount note 5 10,072 8,609 Currency translation adjustment 16,931 525 At 31 December 134,019 135,139 The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK, African and Asian oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred up to 2025.
These provisions have been created based on Tullows internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
ii Deferred taxation UK and overseas corporate PRT taxation Total 000 000 000 At 1 January 2007 2,751 309,174 311,925 Charged to income statement 1,395 21,860 20,465 Acquisition of subsidiary note 26 9,020 9,020 Hedge movement directly to equity note 17 29,918 29,918 Currency translation adjustment 3,877 3,877 At 1 January 2008 1,356 306,259 307,615 Charged to income statement 3,852 47,740 43,888 Disposal of subsidiary note 26 7,398 7,398 Hedge movement directly to equity note 17 2,326 2,326 Currency translation adjustment 74,489 74,489 At 31 December 2008 5,208 342,732 347,940 Deferred UK and overseas corporation tax is provided as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Accelerated capital allowances 294,809 175,549 Decommissioning charges 25,009 40,223 Other temporary differences 1,557 174,810 Currency translation adjustment 74,489 3,877 Provision 342,732 306,259 No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group has no plans to remit these to the UK in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable.
This involves an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the level of deferred tax assets recognised which can result in a charge or credit in the period in which the change occurs.
