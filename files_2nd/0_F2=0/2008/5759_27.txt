Significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies of the Company are noted below.

134 Experian Annual Report 2008 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 2 5 6 37 38 64 Company financial statements B.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued The interest differential reflected in forward foreign exchange contracts is taken to interest expense.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised at fair value, based on forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Gains or losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are taken directly to net foreign exchange gains or losses in the profit and loss account.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply when the timing differences reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Own shares The Experian Group Limited Employee Share Trust, the Experian UK Approved All-Employee Share Plan and the GUS plc ESOP Trust are separately administered trusts.
Liabilities of these trusts are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the trusts mainly comprise shares in the Company.
The assets, liabilities and expenses of the trusts are included in the Companys financial statements as if they were the Companys own.
Such shares held by the trusts are shown as a deduction from total equity shareholders funds at cost.
Share-based payments The Group has a number of equity settled, share-based compensation plans.
These include options and awards in respect of shares in the Company made at or after demerger together with options and awards previously granted in respect of shares in GUS plc which were rolled over into options and awards in respect of shares in the Company at demerger.
The fair value of such options and awards granted to employees of the Company is recognised after taking into account the Companys best estimate of the number of options and awards expected to vest.
The Company revises the vesting estimate at each balance sheet date and non-market performance conditions are included in the vesting estimates.
Amounts are recognised over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured at the date of grant using whichever of the Black-Scholes model, Monte Carlo model and closing market price is most appropriate to the award.
Market based performance conditions are included in the fair value measurement on grant date and are not revised for actual performance.
The issuance by the Company of share incentives to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions and the fair value of such options and awards is therefore recognised as an increase in the Companys investment in group undertakings with a corresponding increase in total equity shareholders funds.
