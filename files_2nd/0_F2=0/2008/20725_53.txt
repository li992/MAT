23 Financial instruments and Risk The Directors Report details the Companys approach to investment risk management on pages 32 and 33 and the accounting policies on pages 60 to 64 explain the basis on which currencies and investments are valued for accounting purposes.
All assets and liabilities are carried at fair value, with the exception of the Companys debenture and preference stocks.
Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust the Company invests in equities, investment property, private equity, and its subsidiary businesses for the long term in order to achieve the investment objectives set on page 8.
In pursuing these objectives the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for payment as dividends.
The principal financial instruments at risk comprise those in the Companys investment portfolio and this note addresses these risks below.
The Group has certain additional risks, and these are detailed in the appropriate sections below.
These risks and the directors approach to managing them are set out below under the following headings: market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk, and other price risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.
The Group has a risk management framework in place which is described in detail on pages 32 and 33.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks have not changed from the previous accounting period.
23.1 Market Risk Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes currency risk see note 23.2, interest rate risk see note 23.3 and price risk see note 23.4.
Market risk is managed on a regular basis by the Asset Liability and Income Committee ALICo.
The purpose of this Executive Committee is to manage the capital of the company within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
The Companys strategy on investment risk is outlined in our statement of investment objectives and policy on page 8.
Details of the investment portfolio at the balance sheet date are disclosed on pages 9 to 23.
In the course of 2007 the Board has approved a derivatives policy but no derivatives transactions had been entered into as at the balance sheet date.
23.2 Currency Risk Some of the groups assets, liabilities and transactions are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency of sterling.
Consequently the group is exposed to the risk that movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The groups currency holdings and gains losses are reviewed regularly by the Directors, and the currency risk is managed on a regular basis by ALICo within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
At the reporting date the group had the following currency exposures: 42472 Financial:42472 Financial 21 4 08 02:23 Page 80 80 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts Currency Exposure Group Overseas Net monetary Total currency Overseas Net monetary Total currency investments assets exposure investments assets exposure 000 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 US dollar 398,364 472 398,836 332,892 14,703 347,595 Euro 448,344 5,675 454,019 266,763 54,663 321,426 Yen - - - 163,793 33,936 197,729 Other non-sterling 329,781 16,771 346,552 334,542 14,593 349,135 1,176,489 22,918 1,199,407 1,097,990 117,895 1,215,885 Currency Exposure Company Overseas Net monetary Total currency Overseas Net monetary Total currency investments assets exposure investments assets exposure 000 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 US dollar 398,364 472 398,836 332,892 14,703 347,595 Euro 448,344 5,675 454,019 266,763 54,663 321,426 Yen - - - 163,793 33,936 197,729 Other non-sterling 329,781 15,008 344,789 334,542 14,394 348,936 1,176,489 21,155 1,197,644 1,097,990 117,696 1,215,686 Sensitivity analysis If the pound had strengthened by 5% relative to all currencies on the reporting date, with all other variables held constant, the income statement and the net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent would have decreased by the amounts shown below.

23.3 Interest Rate Risk The group is exposed to interest rate risk in a number of ways.
A movement in interest rates may affect the fair value of investments in fixed interest rate securities, income receivable on cash deposits and interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
The Company does not generally hold significant cash balances.
It finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels which are approved and monitored by the Board.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows as a result of an interest rate change are taken into account when making investment or borrowing decisions.
The Company has a financial services subsidiary, Alliance Trust Savings Ltd, which holds client deposits and pays interest on these.
This subsidiary has detailed risk management policies, with treasury and cash management undertaken within a framework of banking policies.
These banking policies cover credit risk, counterparty exposure, capital adequacy and liquidity.
The Alliance Trust Savings Management Team reviews interest rate risk on a regular basis.
The following table details the groups and Companys exposure to interest rate risks: GROUP COMPANY 000 2008 2007 2008 2007 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash at Bank 227,653 346,571 30,328 208,647 Bank Overdraft - 5,188 - - Bank loans 159,000 - 159,000 - 68,653 341,383 128,672 208,647 Information for Overview Business Review Governance Directors Remuneration Financial Statements Shareholders 42472 Financial:42472 Financial 21 4 08 12:23 Page 81 Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts | 81 Sensitivity analysis If interest rates had decreased by 5% on the reporting date, with all other variables held constant, the income statement and the net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent would have decreased by the amounts shown below.

23.4 Other price risk Other price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices other than those arising from currency risk or interest rate risk, whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment or its issuer, or by factors affecting all instruments traded in that market.
As the majority of the groups financial assets are carried at fair value with fair value changes recognised in the income statement, all changes in market conditions will directly affect investment income and net assets.
The directors manage price risk by having a suitable investment objective for the Company.
The board reviews this objective and investment performance regularly.
The risk is managed on a regular basis by ALICo within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
As mentioned in Note 23.1 above, ALICo now also has the ability to use derivatives to manage other price risk.
No derivative transactions had been entered into before the balance sheet date.
Concentration of exposure to other price risks An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on page 9.
This shows that the majority of the investments value is in UK companies, with significant amounts also in Europe and North America.
The analysis on page 9 also shows the concentration of investments in various sectors.
The following table details the groups exposure to market price risk on its quoted and unquoted equity investments: 42472 Financial:42472 Financial 21 4 08 02:23 Page 82 82 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts GROUP COMPANY 000 2008 2007 2008 2007 Fixed Asset Investments at Fair Value through Profit & Loss Listed 2,691,274 2,515,749 2,663,402 2,478,858 Unlisted 38,123 22,636 38,123 22,636 Related and Subsidiary Companies - - 40,287 49,030 Property 80,100 67,145 80,100 67,145 2,809,497 2,605,530 2,821,912 2,617,669 Sensitivity analysis 93.5% of the Companys investment portfolio is listed on stock exchanges.
If share prices had increased by 3% at the reporting date with all other variables remaining constant, the income statement and the net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent would have increased by the amounts shown below.
GROUP COMPANY 000 2008 2007 2008 2007 Income Statement Revenue return - - - - Capital return 80,738 75,472 79,902 74,365 Net Assets 80,738 75,472 79,902 74,365 A 3% decrease in share prices would have resulted in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
23.5 Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the group.
This risk is managed as follows: Investment transactions are carried out with a number of well established, approved brokers.
Investment transactions are done on a cash against receipt or cash against delivery basis The group also minimises credit risk through banking polices which restrict deposits to highly rated financial institutions Moodys Aa3 or above.
The policies also set maximum exposure to individual banks.
None of the groups financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the reporting date.
At the reporting date, the groups financial assets exposed to credit risk were as follows: GROUP COMPANY 000 2008 2007 2008 2007 Credit Rating Aaa 31,402 49,000 16,402 40,000 Aa1 15,000 83,934 - 44,754 Aa2 154,510 147,156 13,671 123,793 Aa3 26,741 66,104 255 - A2 - 377 - 100 227,653 346,571 30,328 208,547 Average maturity 22 days 58 days 1 day 3 days At the reporting date the Group was invested in gilts per the table below: GROUP COMPANY 000 2008 2007 2008 2007 Gilts 10,480 17,124 - - Average maturity 175 days 452 days - - The Companys UK listed equities are held in CREST, and its overseas listed equities are held by Bank of New York as custodian.

Other than outlined above there were no significant concentrations of credit risk to counterparties at the reporting date.
No individual investment exceeded 3% of net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent.
