The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge the risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
As explained in section Q of the Groups accounting policies, such derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement in the period.
The Group has a small number of outstanding put options which enable minority shareholders to require the Group to purchase the minority interest shareholding at an agreed multiple of earnings.
These options are treated as derivatives over equity instruments and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value which is re-evaluated at each period end.
Fair value is based on the present value of expected cash outflows.
The movement in fair value is recognised as income or expense within the income statement.

This effective rate results from the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
The impact of changes in statutory tax rates in the year ended 30 September 2007 relate principally to this reduction in the UK corporation tax rate, as a deferred tax charge arose from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those assets were expected to reverse.
Overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

Of the total, tax losses of 7 million will expire at various dates between 2009 and 2017.
These deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the timing of recovery is uncertain.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 2,616 million 2007: 2,726 million relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas operations as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
6 Discontinued operations Year ended 30 September 2008 The profit for the year from discontinued operations of 53 million is comprised of the profit arising on the sale of two properties formerly occupied by Selecta, the European vending business, which was disposed of in July 2007, of nil: an adjustment to deferred tax liabilities forming part of the net assets of businesses disposed of in prior years of 9 million: the release of surplus provisions of 38 million and accruals relating to prior year disposals of 11 million: and a loss after tax from trading activities of 1 million.
Year ended 30 September 2007 The Group disposed of its European vending business, Selecta, on 2 July 2007 for a net profit after tax of 129 million.
The Group also completed the sale and closure of a number of other small businesses as part of the exit from other discontinued operations, and established additional provisions totalling 45 million in respect of prior year disposals in these areas, resulting in a net loss after tax of 11 million before the release of net tax provisions of 79 million.
These provisions were released following the settlement of a number of long-standing issues connected with prior year discontinued activities.
The total net profit after tax arising on the disposal of these operations was 68 million.
Overall an exceptional net credit of 197 million was recognised in the period.

The recoverable amount of a CGU has been determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are longterm growth rates and pre-tax discount rates and use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a five year period.

Trade receivables The book value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the majority of the receivables.
Credit sales are only made after credit approval procedures have been satisfactorily completed.
The policy for making provisions for bad and doubtful debts varies from country to country as different countries and markets have different payment practices, but various factors are considered including how overdue the debt is, the type of debtor and its past history, and current market and trading conditions.
Full provision is made for debts that are not considered to be recoverable.

The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 18: debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19: and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 25.
Financial management The Group continues to manage its interest rate and foreign currency exposure in accordance with the policies set out below.
The Groups financial instruments comprise of cash, borrowings, receivables and payables that are used to finance the Groups operations.
The Group also uses derivatives, principally interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts, to manage interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Groups treasury policies are designed to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates and to manage the Groups financial risks.
The Board approves any changes to the policies.
Liquidity risk The Group finances its borrowings from a number of sources including the bank, the public and the private placement markets.
The Group has developed long-term relationships with a number of financial counterparties with the balance sheet strength and credit quality to provide credit facilities as required.
The Group seeks to avoid a concentration of debt maturities in any one period to spread its refinancing risk.
Foreign currency risk The Groups policy is to match its principal projected cash flows by currency to actual or effective borrowings in the same currency.
As currency cash flows are generated, they are used to service and repay debt in the same currency.
The objective is to achieve an effective foreign currency hedge in real economic terms for the period of the currency loans.
Where necessary, to implement this policy, forward currency contracts are taken out which, when applied to the actual currency liabilities, convert these to an effective amount borrowed by currency.
The borrowings in each currency give rise to foreign exchange differences on translation into Sterling.
As the effective borrowings are either less than, or equate to, the net investment in overseas operations, these exchange rate movements are treated as movements on reserves and recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense rather than in the income statement.
Non-Sterling earnings streams are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Fluctuations in exchange rates have given and will continue to give rise to translation differences.
The Group is partially protected from the impact of such differences through the matching of cash flows to currency borrowings.
The Group has minimal exposure to the foreign currency risk of trade receivables and payables as operations within individual countries have little cross-border activity giving rise to translation risks on trade-related balances.
The main currencies to which the Groups financial position is exposed are the US Dollar, the Euro and the Japanese Yen.
As explained above, the Group seeks to hedge its exposure to currencies by matching debt in currency against the cash flows generated by the Groups foreign operations in such currencies.
The effect of a 10% strengthening of Sterling against these currencies is shown below.
A 10% weakening would result in an equal and opposite impact on the profit or loss and equity of the Group.
This table shows the impact on the financial instruments in place on 30 September and has been prepared on the basis that the 10% change in exchange rates occurred on the first day of the financial year and applied consistently throughout the year.

The Group implements this policy either by borrowing fixed rate debt or by using interest rate swaps so that at least 80% of the Groups projected debt is fixed for one year, reducing to 60% fixed for the second year and 40% fixed for the third year.
The sensitivity analysis given below has been determined based on the derivative and non-derivative financial instruments the Group had in place at the year end date only.
The effect of a 1% increase in interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date on the Groups variable rate cash and cash equivalents and debt at the balance sheet date would be a gain of nil 2007: 2 million over the course of a year.
A similar decrease in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect over the course of a year.

The sensitivity gains and losses given above may vary because cash flows vary throughout the year and interest rate and currency hedging may be implemented after the year end date in order to comply with the treasury policies outlined above.
Credit risk The Groups policy is to minimise its exposure to credit risk from the failure of any single financial counterparty by spreading its risk across a portfolio of financial counterparties and managing the aggregate exposure to each against certain pre-agreed limits.
Exposure to counterparty credit risk arising from deposits, derivative and forward foreign currency contracts is concentrated at the Group centre where possible.
Financial counterparty limits are derived from the long and short-term credit ratings, and the balance sheet strength of the financial counterparty.
All financial counterparties are required to have a minimum short-term credit rating from Moodys of P-1 or equivalent from another recognised agency.
The Groups policy to manage the credit risk associated with trade and other receivables is set out in note 16.
Hedging activities The following section describes the derivative financial instruments the Group uses to apply the interest rate and foreign currency hedging strategies described above.
Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate borrowings.
These instruments swap the fixed interest payable on the borrowings into floating interest rates and hedge the fair value of the borrowings against changes in interest rates.
These interest rate swaps all qualify for fair value hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39.
90 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2008 Consolidated financial statements CG40001 RA p89-114 10 12 08 16:49 Page 91 20 Derivative financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows from floating rate borrowings.
These instruments swap floating interest payable on these borrowings into fixed interest rates and hedge against cash flow changes caused by changing interest rates.
The cash flows and income statement impact hedged in this manner will occur between one and three years of the balance sheet date.
These interest rate swaps do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39 because the Group creates synthetic floating rate foreign currency borrowings see net investment hedges below through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts which IAS 39 prohibits from being designated as a hedged item.
These interest rate swaps are an effective economic hedge against the exposure of the Groups floating rate borrowings to interest rate risk.
Net investment hedges The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt and forward foreign exchange contracts to partially hedge against the change in Sterling value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of debt in a net investment hedge was 1,028 million 2007: 965 million.
Derivatives not in a hedging relationship The Group has a number of derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
These include some interest rate swaps and some forward foreign exchange contracts.
All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the balance sheet.

Provisions in respect of discontinued and disposed businesses relate to estimated amounts payable in connection with onerous contracts and claims arising from disposals.
The final amount payable remains uncertain as, at the date of approval of these financial statements, there remains a further period during which claims may be received.
The timing of any settlement will depend upon the nature and extent of claims received.
Surplus provisions of 38 million 2007: nil were credited to the discontinued operations section of the income statement in the year.
Provisions for onerous contracts represent the liabilities in respect of short-term and long-term leases on unoccupied properties and other contracts lasting under five years.
Provisions for legal and other claims relate principally to provisions for the estimated cost of litigation and sundry other claims.
The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain.
Environmental provisions are in respect of potential liabilities relating to the Groups responsibility for maintaining its operating sites in accordance with statutory requirements and the Groups aim to have a low impact on the environment.
These provisions are expected to be utilised as operating sites are disposed of or as environmental matters are resolved.
23 Post-employment benefit obligations Pension schemes operated The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self-administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups finances.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group makes employer contributions to the various schemes in existence within the range of 6%-35% of pensionable salaries.
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 28 million 2007: 36 million have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
UK schemes Within the UK there are three main arrangements: i Compass Group Pension Plan the Plan : ii Compass Pension Scheme the Scheme : and iii Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan CRISP.
CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003.
This is the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK but existing members of the Plan and the Scheme will continue to accrue benefits under those arrangements.
CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay minimum 3%.
Within CRISP there has been a new defined contribution section established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan CHIP.
Senior employees who contribute to CRISP, the Plan or the Scheme will receive an additional employer-only contribution into CHIP.
The amount of contribution and eligibility for CHIP are decided annually at the Companys discretion.
The payment towards CHIP may be taken as a cash supplement instead of a pension contribution.
The Plan and the Scheme are defined benefit arrangements that are closed to new entrants other than for transfers under public sector contracts where the Group is obliged to provide final salary benefits to transferring employees.
Such transferees enter into special sections of the Plan, known collectively as the GAD sections, which have been certified by the Government Actuarys Department as broadly comparable to the relevant public sector scheme.
After a thorough review by the Group, the pensions accruing under the Plan and Scheme for service accruing after 6 April 2006 other than for the protected members in the GAD sections were reduced so that all members now accrue benefits on an 80th of final pensionable salary basis.
In addition, the link between pensionable pay and salary was removed so that pensionable pay from 6 April 2006 will only increase in line with salary up to a maximum of 5% per annum or the increase in the Retail Price Index if lower.
This change, together with additional funding including lump sums of 280 million in 2005-2006 and 45 million in 2006-2007 from the proceeds of disposals and a reduction in the risk profile of investments means that the Group has taken action to substantially reduce funding deficits in the UK.

The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.
Formal actuarial valuations of the Plan and the Scheme are carried out every three years.
The most recent valuations were as at 5 April 2007.
The final results revealed a significant improvement in the funding positions since the previous valuation, even allowing for the updated mortality assumptions.
The Plan and the Scheme are reappraised annually by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits requirements.
The Chairman, Tony Allen, is independent.
The other six trustee directors are UK-based employees of the Group, three of whom have been member-nominated.
The Plan has a corporate trustee and two independent directors, including the Chairman, Peter Morriss.
There are a further eight trustee directors who are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, four of whom have been member-nominated.
The Scheme is a closed defined benefit arrangement and also has a corporate trustee.
The Chairman, David Bishop, is independent.
The remaining seven trustee directors are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, three of whom have been member-nominated.
Overseas schemes In the USA, the main plan is a defined benefit plan.
The funding policy, in accordance with government guidelines, is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
During 2007, defined benefit arrangements in the Netherlands were closed and replaced with defined contribution arrangements.
The accrued benefits arising from the defined benefit plan were transferred to the respective insurance companies.
In Canada, Norway and Switzerland the Group also participates in funded defined benefit arrangements.
In other countries Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
Other than where required by local regulation or statute, the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
For these schemes the current service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
Disclosures showing the assets and liabilities of the schemes are set out below.

The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the respective investment portfolio of each plan.

Information relating to all option schemes The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 350.52 pence 2007: 345.64 pence.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.1 years 2007: 5.5 years for executive and management schemes and 0.9 years 2007: 1.5 years for employee schemes.
For 2008, options were granted on 28 March 2008 and 30 September 2008.
The estimated fair value of options granted on those dates was 71.52 pence and 80.44 pence respectively.
For 2007, options were granted on 30 March 2007 and 28 September 2007.
The estimated average fair value of these options was 90.97 pence and 62.10 pence respectively.
Fair values for the executive and management schemes were calculated using a binomial distribution option pricing model so that proper allowance is made for the presence of performance conditions and the possibility of early exercise.
In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the probability of performance conditions being met.
Fair values for options granted under employee savingsrelated schemes were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The expected volatility is calculated with reference to weekly movements in the Compass share price over the three years prior to the grant date.

These shares are now reported as lapsed in 2008.
Vesting of LTIP awards made before September 2005 and 50% of LTIP awards made from 1 October 2005 onwards are dependent on the Groups performance relative to a comparator group of companies comprising the FTSE 100 index TSR.
This is treated as a marketbased condition for valuation purposes and an assessment of the vesting probability was built into the grant date fair value calculations.
This assessment was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
The remaining 50% of awards made from October 2005 onwards depend on the achievement of the Group Free Cash Flow GFCF target.
25% of that part of the award will vest if the minimum GFCF target is met, and 100% of that part of the award will vest if the maximum GFCF target is met.

The award of bonus shares is subject to performance conditions and matching shares may be released by the Company following completion of a further period of service.
The terms of the Plan require that these shares are purchased in the market, rather than being issued by the Company.
The shares are purchased and distributed by the ESOP and CGET.

Cash-settled share-based payments In 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Group granted phantom share options to certain employees under the terms of the Management Equity Bonus Plan which mirror grants made under the management option plan.
These require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the option to the employee at the date of exercise.
At 30 September 2008, the Group has recorded liabilities of nil 2007: 1 million.
The fair value of the phantom options is determined using the binomial distribution pricing model using the assumptions shown above.

The adjustments made in respect of the acquisitions in the 12 months to 30 September 2008 are provisional and will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in GR SA represents the premium the Group paid to gain full operational and strategic control of the company.
This will allow the business to be fully integrated into the Group.
The initial goodwill arising on the acquisition of the other businesses represents the premium the Group paid to acquire seven small companies which complement the existing business and create significant opportunities for cross-selling and other synergies.

IHC and the United Nations.
Ernst & Young assisted Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in this investigation.
On 1 February 2006, it was announced that the investigation had concluded.
The investigation established serious irregularities in connection with contracts awarded to ESS by the UN.
The work undertaken by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Ernst & Young gave no reason to believe that these issues extended beyond a few individuals within ESS to other parts of ESS or the wider Compass Group of companies.
The Group settled all outstanding civil litigation against it, in relation to this matter, in October 2006 but litigation continues between competitors of ESS, IHC and other parties involved in UN procurement.
IHCs relationship with the UN and ESS was part of a wider investigation into UN procurement activity being conducted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, and with which the Group cooperated fully.
The current status of that investigation is uncertain and a matter for the US authorities.
Those investigators could have had access to sources unavailable to the Group, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer or Ernst & Young, and further information may yet emerge which is inconsistent with, or additional to, the findings of the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer investigation, which could have an adverse impact on the Group.
The Group has however not been contacted by, or received further requests for information from, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with these matters since January 2006.
The Group has cooperated fully with the UN throughout.
In February 2007, the Groups Portuguese business, Eurest Portugal Sociedade Europeia Restaurantes LDA, was visited by the Portuguese Competition Authority PCA as part of an investigation into possible past breaches of competition law by the Group and other caterers in the sector.
The PCA investigation relates to a part of the Portuguese catering business which services mainly public sector contracts.
The Group is cooperating fully with the PCA.
The investigation has been ongoing for some while and it is likely that it will take several more months to complete.
The outcome cannot be predicted at this point.
Revenues of the Portuguese business for the year ended 30 September 2008 were 110 million a145 million.
It is not currently possible to quantify any potential liability which may arise in respect of these matters.
The directors currently have no reason to believe that any potential liability that may arise would be material to the financial position of the Group.
The Group, through a number of its subsidiary undertakings, is, from time to time, party to various other legal proceedings or claims arising from its normal business.
Provisions are made as appropriate.
None of these proceedings is regarded as material litigation.
The Group has provided a guarantee to one of its joint venture partners over the level of profits which will accrue to them in future periods.
The maximum amount payable under this guarantee is 35 million, which would be payable in respect of the period from 1 July 2007 to 31 December 2010.
Based on the latest management projections, no overall liability is expected to arise in relation to this guarantee.
No provision has been recorded at 30 September 2008 2007: nil.
