Standards and Interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group Annual periods beginning on Standard or after Impact on the Group IFRS 2 AC 139 Share Based Payments 1 January 2009 The impact on the Group is that non-market vesting conditions, other than service and performance conditions, which have always been included in assumptions about the number of awards that are expected to vest, will now be included in the estimate of the fair value of the share awards granted.
The Group is unable to determine the financial impact at this stage.
IFRS 3 AC 140 Business Combinations 1 July 2009 There will be no impact with regards to existing business combinations.
The Group is unable to assess the impact of the application of the Standard in future as such an assessment can only be made on the basis of each individual business combination as and when they occur.
IFRS 8 AC 145 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 Management has assessed the expected impact on the future presentation of the Groups segmental results, assets and liabilities.
This will result in minor presentation changes with the reportable segments remaining unchanged.
IAS 1 AC 101 Presentation of Financial Statements 1 January 2009 The impacts of the changes are of a presentation and disclosure nature, with the most significant impact being the replacement of the statement of recognised income and expense by a statement of comprehensive income and the presentation of a complete statement of changes in equity.
The financial results will not be impacted in any way.
IAS 7 AC 118 Statement of Cash Flows 1 July 2009 The amendment is unlikely to impact the Groups results in the period of initial adoption, unless there is a transaction whereby control is changed but not lost.

IAS 23 AC 114 Borrowing Costs 1 January 2009 The Groups accounting policy already stipulates that such borrowing costs are capitalised, consequently, this amendment has no impact on the Group.
IAS 27 AC 132 Consolidated and Separate 1 July 2009 Unlikely to have a material impact on the Group, however, the main possible Financial Statements impact of the revision is the absorption of losses by non-controlling interests which will increase the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of Mondi if there are losses realised in subsidiaries.
The change in level of control is unlikely to impact the financial results of the Group because the Group currently accounts for transactions where control is not lost as equity transactions.

2 Licences and other intangibles mainly relate to software development costs, and customer relationships and contractual arrangements capitalised as a result of business combinations.
78 Annual report and accounts 2008 Mondi Group 11 Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash-generating units CGUs which reflect how it is monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
Value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets covering a three year period that are based on latest forecasts for revenue and cost as approved by the Boards.
Cash flow projections beyond three years are based on internal management forecasts and assume a growth rate not exceeding gross domestic product for the respective countries.
Pre-tax cash flow projections are discounted using a real pre-tax discount rate of 8.86% 2007: 9.86%, adjusted by 0%-3% reflecting the economic and political risks of the specific location that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows specific to each CGU.
Zero percent real growth rates are assumed in perpetuity for most of the businesses given the commodity nature of the majority of the products i. e. volume growth is assumed to be offset by real price declines.
In certain of the Europe & International cash-generating units, negative growth rates are assumed, in line with long-term growth forecasts for the relevant product segments.
Perpetuity maintenance capital expenditure has been assumed at 60% of depreciation.
In accordance with the methodology required by IAS 36, the impact of the major capex projects in Poland and Russia have been excluded from the discounted cash flow analysis in calculating the value-in-use.
Similarly, they have been excluded from the carrying value of the relevant cash-generating units.
These projects are expected to be commissioned during the second half of 2009 and 2010 respectively.
The assumptions utilised in calculating value-in-use have considered the current economic environment, resulting in a more conservative estimate regarding future value.
Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time.
They are significantly affected by a number of factors, including market and production estimates, together with economic factors such as prices, discount rates, currency exchange rates, estimates of production costs and future capital expenditure.
In respect of the CGUs that have not been impaired, a 1% increase in discount rate or a 1% decrease in cash flows would not give rise to an impairment.

The fair values of trade and other receivables are not materially different to the carrying values presented.
a Trade receivables: credit risk The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables and the associated risk management techniques that the Group deploys in order to mitigate this risk are discussed in note 38. Credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk profiles of, and invoicing conventions established in, the various markets in which the Group operates.
Interest is charged at appropriate market rates on balances which are considered overdue in the relevant market.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, charges have been recorded in the combined and consolidated income statement and the carrying values have been written down to their recoverable amounts.
The total gross carrying value of these impaired trade receivables as at the reporting date is 71 million 2007: 54 million and the associated aggregate impairment is 50 million 2007: 37 million.
Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balance are specific debtor balances with customers totalling 87 million 2007: 103 million which are past due but not impaired as at the reporting date.
The Group has assessed these balances for recoverability and believes that their credit quality remains intact.
An ageing analysis of these past due trade receivables is provided as follows: Trade receivables past due by Less than More than million 1 month 1-2 months 2-3 months 3 months Total Carrying value at 31 December 2008 57 15 6 9 87 Carrying value at 31 December 2007 56 18 15 14 103 Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balances are debtor balances with customers totalling 8 million 2007: 3 million where contractual terms have been renegotiated to extend the credit period offered.
The Group believes that these balances are fully recoverable and therefore no impairment loss has been recognised.
The Group has entered into certain debt factoring arrangements in which the financial counterparties retain recourse in the event of debtor default.
Accordingly, the Group continues to recognise the underlying trade receivables transferred until cash settlement occurs.
A concurrent financing liability is also recognised in respect of the obligation to transfer economic benefit to financial counterparties.
At the reporting date, trade receivables with a value of 1 million 2007: 1 million are subject to such factoring arrangements and an associated financial liability of 1 million 2007: 1 million has been recognised.

A provision is recognised for the present value of such costs.
These costs are expected to be incurred over a period in excess of 20 years.
Other provisions mainly consist of provisions for restructuring and reorganisation costs.
Of these, 24 million 2007: 14 million are due to be incurred within the next 12 months.
The residual 27 million 2007: 30 million will be incurred over a period longer than one year.
All non-current provisions are discounted using a discount rate relevant in the local countries, based on a pre-tax yield on long-term bonds over the last five years.

25 Retirement benefits The Group operates post-retirement defined contribution and defined benefit plans for the majority of its employees.
It also operates post-retirement medical arrangements in South Africa.
The accounting policy for pensions and post-retirement benefits is included in note 1.
Defined contribution plans The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans of 15 million 2007: 18 million is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
There were no material outstanding or prepaid contributions recognised in relation to these plans as at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
Defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical arrangements The majority of the post-retirement defined benefit plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice throughout the world.
The unfunded pension plans are principally in Europe.
The post-retirement medical arrangements provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The majority of these plans are unfunded.
There are no plan assets in respect of post-retirement medical plans.
The Groups defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare arrangements, for the five years ended 31 December 2008, are summarised as follows: 2008 2007 Southern Southern million Africa Europe Total Africa Europe Total Assets Defined benefit plans 8 3 11 Liabilities Defined benefit plans funded and unfunded 132 132 129 129 Post-retirement medical plans 50 50 71 71 Total liabilities 50 132 182 71 129 200 Experience adjustments On plan liabilities 14 3 17 4 1 3 On plan assets 4 30 34 6 2 4 Total experience adjustments 18 33 51 10 3 7 1 Income statement charge Defined benefit pension plan costs 10 10 4 4 Post-retirement medical plan costs 5 5 6 6 Total income statement charge 5 10 15 6 4 10 Note: 1 Includes service costs, past service costs and curtailments where applicable, interest payable on scheme liabilities and expected returns on scheme assets.

Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations every three years using the projected credit unit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2008.
The market value of assets is used to determine the funding level of the plans and is sufficient to cover 100% 2007: 114% of the benefits which have accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
Companies within the Group are paying contributions at rates agreed with the schemes trustees and in accordance with local actuarial advice and statutorial provisions.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members.
Consequently, it is expected that the Groups share of contributions will increase as the schemes members age.
The aggregate benefit obligation in respect of the unfunded plans at 31 December 2008 is 114 million 2007: 127 million.
The total loss, net of applicable tax, recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense relating to experience movements on scheme liabilities and plan assets and actuarial assumption changes for the year ended 31 December 2008 is 14 million 2007: gain of 12 million.
The cumulative total recognised since 1 January 2004 is a loss of 6 million.
The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectations, at the beginning of a reporting period, for returns over the entire life of the related pension obligations.
Expected returns may vary from one reporting period to the next in line with changes in long-run market sentiment and updated evaluations of historic fund performance.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the actual return on plan assets in respect of defined benefit pension schemes was a loss of 17 million 2007: gain of 26 million.

The Group has a dual listed structure and the shares of both Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, the ultimate holding companies for the African and the non-African assets respectively, were admitted to the JSE Limited JSE and the London Stock Exchange LSE on 3 July 2007.
The sharing agreement between Mondi Limited and Mondi plc ensures that the two respective sets of shareholders can be regarded as having the interests of a single economic group.
Accordingly, the Group presents combined and consolidated equity, which represents the combined interests in the Groups equity of both sets of shareholders.
Anglo American plc Prior to the demerger, Anglo American plc injected capital of 120 million into the Mondi Group and took receipt of a final dividend of 202 million, crystallising a net return of capital of 82 million.
Interest of 32 million on a loan instrument deemed to be equity in nature was also capitalised using retained earnings attributable to Anglo American plc.
On 2 July 2007, the Anglo American plc investment in the Mondi Group 2,051 million was terminated by way of a dividend in specie of the whole interest in the Mondi Group to Mondi plcs newly created shareholders see below.
In addition, the legacy profits attributable to Anglo American plc, excluding Mondi Limiteds reserves 198 million, at the date of the demerger 832 million were written off to the demerger reserve.
Annual report and accounts 2008 Mondi Group 97 Financial statements Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued 26 Reconciliation of movement in combined and consolidated equity continued Mondi plc On 2 July 2007, Mondi plc issued its own equity instruments to the owners of Anglo American plc, on a pro rata basis of one ordinary share of Mondi plc for every one Anglo American plc ordinary share held, in exchange for a 100% ownership interest in Mondi Investments Limited formerly Anglo Mondi Investments Limited or AMIL, a holding entity for the entire Mondi Group.
The fair value of the equity instruments issued 2,938 million equalled the fair value of the underlying net assets of Mondi Investments Limited.
Prior to the listing of Mondi plcs shares on the LSE, the nominal share capital raised on the inward transfer of AMIL was reduced and transferred to retained earnings 2,864 million net of share issue costs 74 million and the issue of special converting shares 29 million.
The scrip issue of special converting shares is discussed in note 28.
The dividend in specie represents the transfer of Mondi Limited to its own, newly-created, external shareholders.
The share capital reduction, legally sanctioned by the UK High Court on 2 July 2007, was therefore used to create opening distributable reserves of Mondi plc 1,968 million.
Mondi Limited Mondi Limiteds historical equity has been combined and consolidated with the equity attributable to Mondi plc.
A one-off currency translation adjustment resulted from the retranslation of Mondi Limiteds equity as at 2 July 2007.

The Group classifies these preference shares as a liability, and not as equity instruments, since they contractually obligate the Group to make cumulative dividend payments to the holders.
The dividend payments are treated as a finance cost rather than distributions.
2 The special converting shares are held on trust and do not carry dividend rights.
The special converting shares provide a mechanism for equality of treatment on termination for both Mondi Limited and Mondi plc ordinary equity holders.
29 Share-based payments Mondi share awards The Group has set up its own share-based payment arrangements to incentivise employees, as well as certain transitional schemes to compensate relevant employees for the benefits foregone on outstanding Anglo American plc schemes.
The Group also operates equity-settled demerger arrangements for directors and key management to provide for an orderly transition into the post-demerger period.
In addition, the Co-Investment Plan has been created for the chief executive officer of the Group.
All of these schemes are settled by the award of ordinary shares in either Mondi Limited or Mondi plc.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to settle the awards made under these schemes in cash, except for the reimbursement of dividends foregone on BSP awards that vest.
The demerger arrangements were instituted prior to, and in anticipation of, the demerger.
The associated fair value charge, attributable to the vesting period elapsed, has been recognised from 1 January 2007.
The fair value charges resulting from all other share awards made by the Group, attributable to the vesting periods elapsed, have been recognised from the effective date of grant.
The total fair value charge in respect of all the Mondi share awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2008 is made up as follows: million 2008 2007 Demerger see note 5 9 9 Transitional BSP 1 1 BSP 2007 2 1 LTIP 2007 1 2 Co-Investment Plan 1 BSP 2008 2 LTIP 2008 2 1 Total share-based payment expense 18 13 Note: 1 The fair value charges associated with the transitional LTIP share award scheme are immaterial for the year ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.

All of the schemes were equity-settled, either by award of options to acquire ordinary shares, under the Employee Share Option Scheme ESOS, or award of ordinary shares, under the Bonus Share Plan BSP, the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Share Incentive Plan SIP.
Disclosure of the assumptions used to fair value the awards made under these schemes is contained within the Prospectus dated 1 June 2007.
On demerger from Anglo American plc, the Group cash-settled its obligations in respect of share awards made under these schemes, with the minor exception of outstanding 2004 ESOS awards in South Africa, which will be cash-settled as options are exercised by recipients over a period of two years from the demerger date.
The share-based payments reserve has been adjusted to remove the balance attributable to these schemes, thereby reflecting the elimination of Anglo American plcs equity interest in the Group see note 26 for further information on the Groups demerger accounting.
The total share-based payment charge for the respective periods is made up as follows: 1 million 2008 2007 ESOS 1 BSP 5 LTIP 4 Total share-based payment expense 10 Note: 1 Included within the charge for 2007 is an amount of 8 million representing the accelerated charge on legacy Anglo American plc schemes, which were deemed to have fully vested on demerger.
The accelerated charge has been classified as an operating special item see note 5.

2 Adjustments to the acquired contingent liabilities of Tire Kutsan which was acquired in 2007.
The values used in accounting for the identifiable assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are provisional in nature at the balance sheet date.
If necessary, adjustments will be made to these carrying values, and to the related goodwill, within 12 months of the acquisition date.
The goodwill which arose on the acquisition of Dunapack represents the value harnessed of further expanding into the emerging markets of Hungary and Ukraine and consolidating the Groups position in Bag Converting in the CEE region.
Furthermore it represents significant potential for synergies and rationalisation in Hungary.
The goodwill which arose in Rochester represent the value associated with strengthening the Groups market position in Coatings and the realisation of substantial synergies.
No goodwill was recognised on acquisition of the Loparex Group.
To 31 December 2007 Principal acquisitions made during the year to 31 December 2007, accounted for under the acquisition method, were: Name of entity acquired Nature of entity acquired Date of acquisition Percentage acquired Lenco Rigid plastics manufacturer 4 July 2007 100.0 Unterland Flexible Packaging Plastic films manufacturer 31 August 2007 100.0 Tire Kutsan Containerboard and corrugated packaging manufacturer 3 September 2007 63.4 Annual report and accounts 2008 Mondi Group 103 Financial statements Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued 30 Business combinations continued Details of the aggregate net assets acquired, as adjusted from book to fair value, and the attributable goodwill are presented as follows: million Lenco Unterland Tire Kutsan Other Total Net assets acquired: Intangible assets 24 24 Property, plant and equipment 43 32 74 15 164 Financial asset investments 1 1 1 3 Deferred tax assets 2 2 Inventories 10 14 23 11 58 Trade and other receivables 13 21 45 14 93 Cash and cash equivalents 4 1 2 7 Short-term borrowings 4 2 18 18 42 Other current liabilities 12 14 25 10 61 Long-term borrowings 40 34 33 1 108 Deferred tax liabilities 5 3 1 9 Provisions 1 1 2 1 Contingent liabilities 5 5 Retirement benefits obligation 4 4 3 11 Equity minority interest 20 1 21 Net assets acquired 29 19 35 9 92 2 Goodwill arising on acquisition 38 19 58 3 118 Total cost of acquisition 67 38 93 12 210 Cash acquired net of overdrafts 4 4 1 2 3 3 Debt consideration 14 14 Net cash paid 71 34 78 10 193 Notes: 1 Acquired contingent liabilities relate to financial guarantees that have been issued by the acquiree entity to third parties prior to the acquisition date.

3 The purchase price attributable to a 9.83% ownership interest in Tire Kutsan is due by 3 October 2010.
The obligation carries interest at a market rate until discharged.
During the year to 31 December 2008 adjustments totalling 7 million have been made to the provisional values estimated of net assets of Tire Kutsan acquired in the year to 31 December 2007.
The goodwill which arose on the acquisition of Lenco represented the strategic value placed on the diversification of product mix and on entering the relatively higher growth rigid plastics market sector in South Africa.
The goodwill which arose on the acquisition of Unterland Flexible Packaging represented significant expected synergies with other operations of the Group and the strategic value placed on becoming an integrated operator in the consumer flexibles market.
The goodwill which arose on the acquisition of Tire Kutsan represented the value harnessed from entering a high-growth Turkish market for corrugated packaging and the complementarity achieved with the Groups existing emerging market strategy.

Annual report and accounts 2008 Mondi Group 109 Financial statements Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued 37 Capital management continued Total capital employed is managed on a basis that enables the Group to continue trading as a going concern, while delivering acceptable returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
Additionally, the Group is also committed to reducing its cost of capital by maintaining an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain an optimal capital structure, the Group may adjust the future level of dividends paid to shareholders, repurchase shares from shareholders, issue new equity instruments or dispose of assets to reduce its net debt exposure.
The Group reviews its total capital employed on a regular basis and makes use of several indicative ratios which are appropriate to the nature of the Groups operations and are consistent with conventional industry measures.
The principal ratios used in this review process are: gearing, defined as net debt divided by total capital employed: and return on capital employed, defined as underlying operating profit, plus share of associates net earnings, before special items, divided by average capital employed.
The Group operates a DLC structure which has been agreed with the South African Ministry of Finance and is subject to certain exchange control conditions.
The exchange control conditions do not infringe upon the Groups ability to manage its capital structure optimally.
However, they do require that the capital supplied by, or made available to, the shareholders of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, is constrained by the equality of treatment mechanism, which serves to maintain and protect the economic interests of both sets of shareholders.
38 Financial risk management The Groups trading and financing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact on current or future earnings.
Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Boards and are overseen by the DLC executive committee.
In turn, the DLC executive committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies.
Group treasury continually reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment, identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks by entering into derivative contracts with counterparties where appropriate.
The Group does not take positions on derivative contracts speculatively and only enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to foreign exchange and cash flow interest rate risk.
Both risks are actively monitored on a continuous basis and managed through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps interest rate swaps respectively.
Although the Groups cash flows are exposed to movements in key input and output prices, such movements represent economic rather than residual financial risk inherent in commodity payables and receivables.
Consequently, the Group is not substantively exposed to commodity price risk as defined in IFRS 7.
Since the impact on the Groups equity would be immaterial for a wide range of relevant commodity price changes, the Group has chosen not to perform sensitivity analysis on its commodity price derivatives.
The Group is also exposed to a limited extent to the equity price risk that attaches to its available for sale financial asset investments.
Even under stressed market conditions, the impact on earnings or equity attributable to the crystallisation of equity price risk would be immaterial.
Accordingly, the Group has chosen not to disclose sensitivity analysis on equity price risk.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates across various national boundaries and is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the normal course of its business.
Multiple currency exposures arise from forecast commercial transactions denominated in foreign currencies, recognised financial assets and liabilities monetary items denominated in foreign currencies and the translational exposure on net investments in foreign operations.
110 Annual report and accounts 2008 Mondi Group 38 Financial risk management continued Forward foreign exchange contracts The Groups foreign exchange policy requires its subsidiaries to actively manage foreign currency exposures against their functional currencies by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts.
The management of foreign exchange exposures incorporates both forecast transactions and recognised monetary items in the balance sheet.
For segmental reporting purposes, each subsidiary enters into, and accounts for, forward foreign exchange contracts with Group treasury or with counterparties that are external to the Group, whichever is more commercially appropriate.
Currencies bought or sold forward to mitigate possible unfavourable movements on forecast transactions are designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups budgeting and forecasting systems enable subsidiaries to assign a high degree of probability to forecast transactions and this therefore qualifies them for designation as hedged items.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of designated forward foreign exchange contracts are initially taken to the cash flow hedging reserve in equity and are subsequently recycled to profit or loss when the underlying forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
The fair value of a forward foreign exchange contract is determined by reference to the current applicable spot foreign exchange rate, as adjusted by the forward points and multiplied by the contracted nominal cash flows.
The forward points reflect interest rate differentials between the two relevant currencies.
Utilisation of cash flow hedging enables the Group to recycle the fair value movements accreted on forward foreign exchange contracts and to match them with the crystallisation of the foreign exchange risk attributable to the designated hedged items in the combined and consolidated income statement.
The effect of applying this accounting treatment is to reduce the underlying volatility of reported earnings.
Hedging documentation is subjected to regular internal and external review, which reduces the risk of hedging ineffectiveness.
Currencies bought or sold forward to mitigate possible unfavourable movements on recognised monetary items are fair valued at each reporting date.
Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at each reporting date to incorporate the underlying foreign exchange movements, as prescribed by IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, and any such movements naturally offset against fair value movements on related forward foreign exchange contracts.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis Foreign exchange risk sensitivity analysis has been performed on the foreign currency exposures inherent in the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at the reporting dates presented, net of related forward positions.
The sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact on the Groups reported earnings of reasonably possible changes in the currency exposures embedded within the functional currency environments that the Group operates in.
In addition, an indication is provided of how reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates might impact on the Groups equity, as a result of fair value adjustments to forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
Reasonably possible changes are based on an analysis of historic currency volatility, together with any relevant assumptions regarding near-term future volatility.

2 Net monetary exposures represent financial assets less financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency, adjusted for the effects of foreign currency hedging, excluding cash flow hedging.
Resultant impacts of reasonably possible changes to foreign exchange rates The Group believes that for each functional to foreign currency net monetary exposure it is reasonable to assume a 5% appreciation depreciation of the functional currency.
If all other variables are held constant, the table below presents the impacts on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement if these currency movements had occurred.
Income expense 2008 million 5% 5% Functional currency zones: Euro 1 1 Russian rouble 1 1 Slovakian koruna 1 1 Other 7 7 Income expense 2007 million 5% 5% Functional currency zones: South African rand 2 2 Euro 1 1 Russian rouble 4 4 Swedish krona 2 2 Czech koruna 2 2 Other 2 2 The corresponding fair value impact on the Groups combined and consolidated equity, resulting from the application of these reasonably possible changes to the valuation of the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flows hedges, would have been -5 million 2007: -9 million.
It has been assumed that changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are fully recorded in equity and that all other variables are held constant.
112 Annual report and accounts 2008 Mondi Group 38 Financial risk management continued Cash flow interest rate risk The Group holds cash and cash equivalents, which earns interest at a variable rate and has variable rate debt in issue.
Consequently, the Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
Although the Group also has fixed rate debt in issue, the Groups accounting policy stipulates that all borrowings are held at amortised cost.
As a result, the carrying value of fixed rate debt is not sensitive to changes in credit conditions in the relevant debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
Management of cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, together with short-term highly liquid investments which have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Centralised cash pooling arrangements are in place, which ensure that cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and, in addition, to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
Management of variable rate debt The Group has multiple variable rate debt facilities, of which the two most significant are syndicated facilities denominated in euros and South African rand respectively see note 21.
Group treasury uses interest rate swaps to hedge certain exposures to movements in the relevant inter-bank lending rates, primarily the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and the Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate JIBAR.
Interest rate swaps are ordinarily formally designated as cash flow hedges and are fair valued at each reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are determined at each reporting date by reference to the discounted contractual future cash flows, using the relevant currency-specific yield curves, and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
The resultant effective portion of the fair value gains and losses are initially taken to the cash flow hedging reserve in equity and are subsequently recycled for offset against the interest cash flows arising on the hedged item.
Cash flow hedging enables the Group to recycle the fair value movements accreted on interest rate swaps from equity and to match them with the crystallisation of the cash flow interest rate risk attributable to the variable rate debt in the Groups combined and consolidated income statement.
Hedging effectiveness documentation is subjected to regular internal and external review, which reduces the risk of hedging ineffectiveness.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents also acts as a natural hedge against possible unfavourable movements in the relevant inter-bank lending rates on its variable rate debt, subject to any interest rate differentials that exist between corporate saving and lending rates.
Net variable rate debt sensitivity analysis The net variable rate exposure represents variable rate debt less the future cash outflows swapped from variable-to-fixed via interest rate swap instruments and cash and cash equivalents.
Reasonably possible changes in interest rates have been applied to net variable rate exposure, as denominated by currency, in order to provide an indication of the possible impact on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement.

In addition to the above, the Group has swapped through the foreign exchange market Euro for certain emerging market currencies, notably Russian rouble, Czech koruna, Polish zloty and Mexican peso, using foreign exchange contracts of mostly six month tenure, that has the effect of exposing the Group to interest rates of these emerging markets.

Credit risk The Groups credit risk is mainly confined to the risk of customers defaulting on sales invoices raised.
Any credit risk arising from cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is deemed to be insignificant on the basis that nearly all relevant counterparties are investment grade entities assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Several Group entities have also issued certain financial guarantees to external counterparties in order to achieve competitive funding rates for specific debt agreements entered into by other Group entities.
None of these financial guarantees contractually obligates the Group to pay more than the recognised financial liabilities in the entities concerned.
As a result, these financial guarantee contracts have no bearing on the credit risk profile of the Group as a whole.
The Group has also provided committed loan facilities to Mondi Packaging South Africa and Mondi Shanduka Newsprint.
Full disclosure of the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table.
Groups exposure to credit risk million 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents 155 180 Derivative financial instruments 73 17 Trade and other receivables 1,088 1,289 Loans and receivables 5 6 Total credit risk exposure 1,321 1,492 114 Annual report and accounts 2008 Mondi Group 38 Financial risk management continued Credit risk associated with trade receivables The Group has a large number of unrelated customers and does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any particular customer.
The Group believes that there is no significant geographical concentration of credit risk, with each geographical segment representing a similar degree of exposure.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the relevant markets that they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across all business segments, such as the use of credit rating agencies, credit guarantee insurance, where appropriate, and the maintenance of a credit control function.
Of the total trade receivables balance of 891 million 2007: 1,117 million reported in the combined and consolidated balance sheet, credit insurance covering 592 million 2007: 462 million of the total balance has been taken out by the Groups trading entities to insure against the related credit default risk.
The insured cover is presented gross of contractually agreed excess amounts.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and retrospectively assessed assumptions to forecast the future cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
The following table shows the amounts available to draw down on the Groups committed loan facilities.
million 2008 2007 Expiry date In one year or less 167 185 In more than one year 895 1,025 Total credit available 1,062 1,210 Forecast liquidity represents the Groups expected cash inflows, principally generated from sales made to customers, less the Groups contractually determined cash outflows, principally related to supplier payments and the repayment of borrowings, including finance lease obligations, plus the payment of any interest accruing thereon.
The matching of these cash inflows and outflows rests on the expected ageing profiles of the underlying assets and liabilities.
Short-term financial assets and financial liabilities are represented primarily by the Groups trade receivables and trade payables respectively.
The matching of the cash flows that result from trade receivables and trade payables takes place typically over a period of three to four months from recognition in the balance sheet and is managed to ensure the ongoing operating liquidity of the Group.
Financing cash outflows may be longerterm in nature.
The Group does not hold long-term financial assets to match against these commitments, but is significantly invested in long-term non-financial assets which generate the sustainable future cash inflows, net of future capital expenditure requirements, needed to service and repay the Groups borrowings.
The Group also assesses its commitments under interest rate swaps, which hedge future cash flows from two to five years from the balance sheet date presented.
Contractual maturity analysis Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial asset held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The Groups financial investments, which are not held for trading and therefore do not comprise part of the Groups liquidity planning arrangements, make up the remainder of the non-derivative financial assets held.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity profile for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.
Non-interest bearing financial liabilities which are due to be settled in less than 12 months from maturity equal their carrying values, since the impact of the time value of money is immaterial over such a short duration.
