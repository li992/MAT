The overall expected rate of return on assets is the weighted average of the expected rate of return on each applicable asset class and reflects the long-term target asset allocation as at the reporting date.
For bonds, the expected rate of return reflects the redemption yields available on corporate and government bonds, as applicable, as at the reporting date.
For all other asset classes, the expected rate of return reflects the rate of return expected over the long term.
The principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date expressed as weighted averages for defined benefit pension schemes are as follows: Australia Americas Europe South Africa 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % % % % % % % Discount rate 6.5 6.3 6.6 6.2 6.4 5.6 10.8 8.5 Future salary increases 5.0 4.9 4.4 4.3 5.2 4.7 9.3 6.8 Future pension increases 3.0 2.8 3.0 2.6 8.2 5.5 Expected rate of return on pension scheme assets 6.5 6.2 7.2 6.9 6.7 6.8 11.7 8.4 The principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date expressed as weighted averages for post-retirement medical schemes are as follows: Americas South Africa 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % % % Discount rate 6.3 6.2 10.5 8.3 Medical cost trend rate ultimate 5.0 5.0 9.3 7.3 Assumptions regarding future mortality can be material depending upon the size and nature of the plan liabilities.
