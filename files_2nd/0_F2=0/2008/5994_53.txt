The group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies approved by the board of directors.
The group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Market risk The groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the purchase of inventory in US dollars: and interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.
Foreign currency risk management The group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate uctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 Euro 3,286 1,436 14 572 Hong Kong dollar 396 213 290 US dollar 3,132 3,328 3,419 2,730 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis A significant proportion of products sold through the groups Home Shopping and Educational Supplies divisions are procured through the groups Far East buying ofce.
The currency of purchase for these goods is principally the US dollar, with a proportion being in Hong Kong dollars.
The following table details the groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Sterling against the relevant foreign currencies.
10% represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower.
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency.
For a 10% weakening of the Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.
co. uk 75 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 39 Financial Instruments continued Forward foreign exchange contracts The group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated sales and purchase transactions out to approximately 12 months from the balance sheet date.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the year end all of these contracts are designated at fair value through the profit and loss account: Outstanding contracts Average exchange rate Foreign currency Contract value Fair value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Rate Rate US$000 US$000 000 000 000 000 Buy US dollars Less than 3 months 1.9974 5,000 2,503 22 3 to 6 months 2.0409 1.9025 5,000 10,000 2,450 5,256 89 154 6 months 2.0265 1.9668 18,000 10,000 8,883 5,085 346 27 11111111 2.0239 1.9346 28,000 20,000 13,836 10,341 457 127 11111111 Changes in the fair value of non-hedging currency derivatives amounting to 584,000 have been credited to income in the year 2007: 381,000 charge to income.
Interest rate risk management The group is exposed to interest rate risk as the group borrow funds at both xed and oating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the group by maintaining an appropriate mix between xed and oating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and dened risk appetite: ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For oating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 50 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the groups profit and equity reserves for the year ended 31 March 2008 would decrease increase by 1,992,000 2007: decrease increase by 1,611,000.
This is mainly attributable to the groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the group agrees to exchange the difference between xed and oating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued xed rate debt held and the cash ow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash ows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
76 39 Financial Instruments continued The following details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date.
The group uses interest rate derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings by the use of interest rate Collar arrangements.
Contracts with a nominal value of 50m have a Cap of 5.75% and a Floor of 4.70% for the period to 4 January 2010 and contracts with a nominal value of 50m have a Cap of 6.25% and a Floor of 4.24% for the period to 4 January 2010.
At 31 March 2008 the fair value of the groups interest rate derivatives is a liability of 0.3m 2007: asset of 0.3m.
These amounts are based on quoted market prices for equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of non-hedging interest rate derivatives amounting to 589,000 have been charged to income in the year 2007: 298,000 credit to income.
Due to the nature of many of the groups hedging and derivative instruments, hedge accounting has not been adopted for these hedging relationships.
Consequently, all of these instruments are designated at fair value through the profit and loss account.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made when there is an identied loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ows.
A more detailed commentary of the groups exposure to credit risk within its trade receivables, and the procedures employed to manage this risk, is set out in note 21.
The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are connected entities.
Other than the loan to associate disclosed in note 40, concentration of credit did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the directors best estimate of the groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity proles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 25 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
