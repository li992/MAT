Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and are all unsecured.
They bear interest at rates set by reference to applicable local rates.
Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table.
Derivatives For interest rate swaps broker quotes are used.
Forward exchange contracts are valued by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward rate.
54 Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 21 Financial instruments continued Interest-bearing loans Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
For amounts with a repricing maturity of less than one year carrying amount approximates fair value.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at market rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities Receivables and payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
For amounts with a repricing maturity of less than one year the carrying amount approximates fair value.
Risk management objectives and policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, market and credit.
Each of these are managed in accordance with Board approved policies.
The policies are set out below.
Liquidity risk The Groups key priority is to ensure that it can always meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group ensures this by always having sufficient committed debt facilities in place to meet all its anticipated funding requirements.
The Groups forecast funding requirements and its committed debt facilities are reported to and monitored by the Treasury Committee monthly.
As at 31 March 2008 the Group had three committed revolving bank facilities, one bilateral multicurrency facility for 12.5m, a syndicated multicurrency facility for 110m and US $120m and a syndicated facility for 63.5m, all with a maturity of February 2010.
It also had a fully drawn bank facility for Yen 800m with a maturity of December 2010 and a fully drawn, amortising, bank facility of 3.6m as at 31 March 2008, with a final maturity of March 2012.
The bank facility for 3.6m was secured on the Groups warehouse in Bad Hersfeld.
As at 31 March 2008, the Group had available 81.1m of undrawn committed debt facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The Group also uses bank overdrafts, uncommitted short term money market loans, cash and short term investments.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups day-to-day funding and liquidity requirements.
Although external credit market conditions have worsened over the year the Group does not believe its liquidity risk, i. e. its ability to raise sufficient committed debt finance as and when required, has materially changed.

Some operating companies also have receivables in currencies other than their functional currency.
Hedging of currency exposures over operating company catalogue lives is implemented in order to shelter the forecast gross profits over those catalogue lives.
In this way the impacts of currency fluctuations can be smoothed until catalogue selling prices can be changed in the light of movements in exchange rates.
The hedges are enacted through forward foreign currency contracts entered into by Group Treasury based on trading projections provided by the operating companies.
In addition specific cash flows relating to material transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the local business are hedged when the commitment is made.
Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 55 Notes to the Group Accounts continued 21 Financial instruments continued Within cash flow hedges the Group classifies forward exchange contracts as hedging instruments against forecast receivables payables.
The forecast cash flows are expected to occur evenly throughout the period for 14 months from the year end, and will affect the profit and loss account in the period in which they occur.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts not used as hedges of forecast transactions at 31 March 2008 was nil.
Cash flow hedges m Fair value of cash flow hedges as at 31 March 2006: Assets 0.9 Liabilities 1.0 Net 0.1 In the year ended 31 March 2007: Amount removed from equity and taken to income statement in operating profit 0.4 Ineffective hedges taken to income statement in operating profit Fair value of cash flow hedges taken to equity 1.4 Fair value of cash flow hedges as at 31 March 2007: Assets 2.0 Liabilities 1.1 Net 0.9 In the year ended 31 March 2008: Amount removed from equity and taken to income statement in operating profit 0.8 Ineffective hedges taken to income statement in operating profit 0.1 Fair value of cash flow hedges taken to equity 10.7 Fair value of cash flow hedges as at 31 March 2008: Assets 1.1 Liabilities 11.8 Net 10.7 Foreign currency transaction exposures, and the hedges in place to mitigate them, are monitored monthly by Group Treasury.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency transactional risk has materially altered during the year.
Foreign currency translational risk The Group has designated certain external loans as net investment hedges against its investments in its US and European subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of the US hedge as at 31 March 2008 was US $170m 85.4m, of which US $104.9m 52.7m formed part of the unsecured bank facility and US $65.1m 32.7m was in the form of an overdraft.
The carrying amount of the Euro hedge was 65m 52.0m, of which 40m 32m formed part of the unsecured bank facility and 25m 20m was in the form of an overdraft.
Both the US Dollar and Euro overdrafts were shown in the balance sheet netted with positive cash balances, as there is an absolute right of set-off.
The carrying value of these US $ and hedges remained unchanged, and 100% effective, throughout the year ended 31 March 2008 and the year ended 31 March 2007.
A foreign exchange loss of 6.5m 2007: gain 12.2m was recognised in equity on translation of the loans to Sterling in the year ended 31 March 2008.
No other foreign currency translation exposures are explicitly hedged although local currency debt is used where economic and fiscally efficient in the financing of subsidiaries and this provides a partial economic hedge.
Guidelines are in place for reviewing the impact of translation exposures on both the currency mix of the Groups net debt and the Groups consolidated profit and loss and net assets.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency translational risk has materially altered during the year.
56 Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 21 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Group has relatively low levels of debt and therefore interest rate risk.
For this reason the Group adopts a policy of paying and receiving interest on a variable interest rate basis, since this minimises interest cost over time.
This policy is subject to regular monitoring of the effect of potential changes in interest rates on its interest cost with a view to taking suitable actions should exposure reach certain levels.
The Group does not believe its interest rate risk has materially altered during the year.
Two interest rate swaps have been entered into in order to hedge interest rate risk.
The swaps mature over the next four years following the maturity of the related loans, one of which is amortising, and have fixed swap rates of 1.15% and 3.85%.
At 31 March 2008 the Group had interest rate swaps with notional contract amounts of JPY 800m and 3.6m 2007: JPY 800m and 4.5m.
Interest rate profile The interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instruments, as at 31 March 2008 and as at 31 March 2007 are set out below.
In the case of non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of the interest rate swaps.

Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the impact: On the interest expense of a 1% increase decrease in interest rates on all currencies from their actual levels for the year ended 31 March 2007 and the year ended 31 March 2008: On the Group profit before tax of a 1% increase decrease in the value of the US Dollar and the Euro against Sterling from the actual level for the year ended 31 March 2007 and the year ended 31 March 2008.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the following: Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments: Changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are recognised at their fair market value: Changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments and all interest rate hedges are expected to be highly effective: Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end: All net investment and foreign currency cash flow hedges are expected to be effective.

The amounts in the balance sheet represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date, as exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers and geographical location.
As such the Group does not believe its credit risk has materially altered during the year.
Financial assets The Group identifies counterparties of suitable creditworthiness based on ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and has procedures to ensure that only these parties are used, that exposure limits are set based on the external credit ratings, and that these limits are not exceeded.
Trade and other receivables All operating companies have credit policies and monitor their credit exposure on an ongoing basis.
Each operating company performs credit evaluations on all customers seeking credit over a certain amount.
Trading receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by local management based on prior experience of customers and assessment of their current economic environment.
There are no significant individual allowances for doubtful receivables included within this amount.
For countries with no local operating company presence export credit limits are set and monitored on a country basis monthly by Group Treasury.
Given the profile of our customers, whereby credit risk is spread amongst a large number of customers with small balances, no further material credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographical region was: 2008 2007 m m UK 58.3 61.0 US 18.1 18.1 Euro zone countries 66.8 57.3 Other European countries 2.3 2.2 Japan 2.7 2.3 Other countries 12.9 10.4 161.1 151.3 58 Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
