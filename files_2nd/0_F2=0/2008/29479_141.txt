Share-based payments During the year ended 31 December 2008 the Group operated a number of different equity settled share-based payment arrangements, which are aggregated as follows: SAYE plan this is a standard HMRC approved scheme that is available to all employees where individuals can contribute up to 250 per month over three years to purchase shares at a price not less than 80% of the market price at the date of the invitation to participate.
Executive deferred bonus schemes under these plans the deferred element of the annual bonus is used to purchase shares at market value in the Company.
The shares are held by the Company until vesting after three years and, in addition to the performance targets, which apply prior to any entitlement being granted, further performance conditions may also apply on vesting.
Executive performance share plan the Remuneration Committee of the Group Board may make awards of performance shares to the executive Directors and other senior managers.
Two-thirds of shares awarded to Directors are subject to an earnings growth condition of the Group and one-third of shares awarded to Directors are subject to a comparative total shareholder return condition, both measured over a three year period.
Further information regarding the vesting conditions of the earnings growth and total shareholder return dependent portions of the award is given in the Remuneration Report on page 68.
Awards made to senior managers are largely only subject to the earnings growth condition of the Group.
Executive and sales management share option schemes these include both approved and unapproved elements and vest after three or five year periods subject to satisfying personal and or Group earnings performance.
The last award under these schemes was made in 2005.
Partner share option schemes these were offered to the Partners of the St. Jamess Place Partnership and vest over three to six years subject to satisfying personal sales related performance criteria.
The last award under these schemes was made in 2007.
Partner performance share plan a new scheme was launched in January 2008 whereby Partners would be entitled to purchase shares in the future at nominal value 15p.
The number of shares the Partners will be entitled to purchase will depend on their personal sales production in the year of the award and validation over the following 3 years.
Share options outstanding under the various share option schemes at 31 December 2008 amount to 32.9 million shares 2007: 35.0 million.
Of these, 29.2 million are under option to Partners of the St. Jamess Place Partnership, 2.5 million are under option to executives and senior management including 0.03 million under option to Directors as disclosed in the Remuneration Report on page 75 and 1.2 million are under option through the SAYE scheme.

The table below shows the assumptions and models used to calculate the grant date fair value of each award: SAYE Executive Executive Partner Partner Deferred Performance Share Option Performance Bonus Share Plan Schemes Share Plan Valuation model Black Black Monte Binomial Black Scholes Scholes Carlo Lattice Scholes Awards in 2007: 2 4 Fair value pence 152.24 469.08 263.28 447.75 177.80 to 209.70 - 5 Share price pence 447.75 469.08 362.00 to 457.25 401.25 to 465.00 - Exercise price pence 370.00 0.00 0.00 401.25 to 465.00 1 Expected volatility % pa 27 N A 27 38 to 40 - 3 Expected dividends % pa 0.8 N A N A 0.7 to 0.8 - Risk-free interest rate % pa 5.4 N A N A 4.8 to 5.5 - Volatility of competitors % pa N A N A 18 to 32 N A - Correlation with competitors % pa N A N A 30 N A - Awards in 2008: 2 4 Fair value pence 95.68 263.50 161.61 266.25 - 247.8 5 Share price pence 260.00 263.50 266.25 to 274.75 - 276.0 Exercise price pence 213.00 0.00 0.00 - 0.15 1 Expected volatility % pa 40 N A 38 - 31 3 Expected dividends % pa 1.7 N A N A - 1.4 Risk-free interest rate % pa 4.1 N A N A - 4.5 Volatility of competitors % pa N A N A 24 to 50 - N A Correlation with competitors % pa N A N A 45 - N A Notes: 1 Expected volatility is based on an analysis of the Companys historic share price volatility over a period typically three or five years which is commensurate with the expected term of the options or the awards.
2 In 2007 and 2008, the vesting period for the SAYE plan was three years.
The vesting period may be extended by up to six months in order to catch up on missed contributions up to a maximum of six.
3 Dividends payable on the shares during the restricted period are paid out during the restricted period for the executive deferred bonus schemes and no dividend yield assumption is therefore required.
4 The awards made under the executive performance share plan are dependent upon earnings growth in the Company two-thirds of the award and a total shareholder return of a comparator group of companies one-third of the award.
This results in having two fair values for each of the awards made in the table above, the first being in relation to the comparator total shareholder return and the second relating to the Companys earnings growth.
5 Awards were made under the executive performance share plan on five and seven separate occasions during 2007 and 2008, respectively.
6 There were no awards made in 2007 or 2008 for the executive share option schemes or the sales management share option schemes.

The options outstanding under the executive share option schemes at 31 December 2008 had exercise prices ranging from 85.5 pence to 257 pence and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.2 years.
The options outstanding under the sales management share option schemes at 31 December 2008 had exercise prices ranging from 80 pence to 242 pence and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.3 years.
The options outstanding under the Partner share option schemes at 31 December 2008 had exercise prices ranging from 75 pence to 465 pence and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.3 years.
Early exercise assumptions The following allowance has been made for the impact of early exercise once options have vested: 1 SAYE plan all option holders are assumed to exercise half-way through the six month exercise window.
2 Executive, sales management and partner share option schemes it is assumed that 10% of option holders are forced to exercise their options each year irrespective of the level of the share price.
For the remainder it is assumed that one-half will exercise their options each year if the share price is at least 33% above the exercise price.
Allowance for performance conditions The executive performance share plan includes a market based performance condition based on the Companys total shareholder return relative to an index of comparator companies.
The impact of this performance condition has been modelled using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, which involve running many thousands of simulations of future share price movements for both the Company and the comparator index.
For the purpose of these simulations it is assumed that the share price of the Company and the comparator index are 30% correlated and that the comparator index has volatilities ranging between 18% pa and 32% pa.
The performance condition is based on the Companys performance relative to the comparator index over a three year period commencing on 1 January each year.
The fair value calculations for the awards that were made in 2008 therefore include an allowance for the actual performance of the Companys share price relative to the index over the period between 1 January 2008 and the various award dates.
