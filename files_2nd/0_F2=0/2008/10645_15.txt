Following consultation with members of the main sections of the Schemes, the pension ultimately payable to an individual will be based on their average earnings, calculated over the period of pensionable service career average revalued earnings or CARE rather than their salary in the period immediately preceding retirement final salary.
The averaging of salary described above will take place only for future periods of service.
The pension built up to 31 July 2007 will be calculated on final pensionable salary and will increase in line with inflation, capped at 5% per annum, up to retirement date.
As a result of this change the retirement benefit obligation was reduced by 18,190,000 net of costs in the year to 31 July 2007.
2 The integration and transition costs have arisen as a r esult of the acquisitions of HBS Business Services Group Limited renamed Mouchel Business Services Limited MBS and Hedra plc renamed Mouchel Management Consulting Limited MCL.
The integration of MBS and MCL has resulted in a small number of staff redundancies, the closure of a loss-making business and other transition costs.
3 Rebrand costs are the costs associated with the change in name for the Group from Mouchel Parkman plc to Mouchel Group plc in December 2007.
4 The Group treats the amortisation of intangible assets arising from business combinations as exceptional costs.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all dilutive share options in issue and shares under Save As You Earn schemes.
The share price used to calculate diluted earnings per share is based on a weighted average price of 428.13p 31 July 2007: 407.05p.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated after adding back shares held by the employee share trusts to the weighted average number of shares.
Earnings are adjusted to exclude amortisation of intangible assets arising from business combinations and other exceptional items net of taxation.
The Directors believe that this additional measure provides a better indicator of the underlying trends in the business.

These calculations use conservative pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets, extrapolated using estimated prudent growth rates stated below.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average for the business in which the CGU operates.
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are as follows: Government Regulated Highways Services Industries % % % Budgeted net margin 8.0-14.0 4.0-10.0 4.0-13.0 Growth rate for the first five years 5.0-8.0 5.0 5.0 Long-term average growth rate 2.3 2.3 2.3 Discount rate pre-tax 10.2 10.2 10.2 These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU within the business segment.
Budgeted net margin is based on past performance and its expectations of market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.
There were no impairments identified during the year.

Customer relationships brought forward have a useful life of between nine and 15 years.
The approximate remaining lives of these relationships are between eight and 12 years.
The two customer relationships acquired in the year as a result of the acquisitions of HBS and Hedra have a useful life of 13 years and seven years respectively.
The values of these relationships were arrived at by discounting attributable future cash flows.
A discount rate of between 10% and 13% was used as appropriate, based on the weighted average cost of capital of the acquired entity.
A customer attrition rate of between 7% and 15% was assumed.
Software costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of between three and five years.
All amortisation charges in the year have been charged through administrative expenses.
Other intangibles comprise non-compete agreements, specialist software acquired and a licence for the Contractors Assurance Case CAC which enables us to work on UK railways.
The software was valued on a replacement cost basis and is amortised over five years.
The values of the non-compete agreements were calculated using discounted cash flows on two base cases: one assuming employees did compete and comparing that with the values obtained if employees did not compete.
Their useful lives are between two and three years: the same timespan as the non-compete agreement is enforceable for.
The CAC was valued on a replacement case basis.
Once granted, this licence does not need to be renewed and therefore has an indefinite life.
Depreciation in the year on those assets was 246,000 2007: 10,000.
1 Items with a gross cost of 8,748,000 and a nil net book value were written off during the year.

The new revolving credit facility detailed in note 22 includes an unsecured overdraft facility of up to 5 million.
22 Borrowings On 1 August 2007, an unsecured revolving credit facility of 125 million was put in place jointly with Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB.
On 4 March 2008, the Group extended its credit facility to 185 million to fund the acquisition of Hedra plc.
Between 2 August 2007 and 31 July 2008 amounts totalling 133.74 million were drawn down.
The facilities mature in August 2012 and September 2009 respectively.
Interest is being charged at LIBOR plus a margin on the ratio of net borrowings to earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation.
MBS has existing secured loans which are repayable in instalments over five years.
Interest is charged at 6.84% on the first loan and 7.44% on the second loan, per annum.
Loans are repayable as follows: Group 2008 2007 000 000 Obligations due within one year 1,165 Obligations due within one and two years 48,671 Obligations due within two and five years 87,079 Total loans due 136,915 Loan issue costs incurred 1,093 Amortisation of loan issue costs 170 Net borrowings 135,992 Loan issue costs of 1,093,000 have been capitalised and are being amortised over the life of the loan.
On 17 December 2007, the Group entered into agreements to hedge against the interest rate risk on the revolving credit facility above.
At 31 July 2008, the total fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was 337,000 2007: nil.

The intercompany loan notes included a discounted convertible loan note DCLN which is both payable and receivable from different group undertakings of 299,038,000.
The conditions for compulsory conversion of the DCLN were met and the note was converted on 31 July 2008 into shares.
All other intercompany loan notes, both payable and receivable, have a five-year term and attract interest at a fixed rate of 6% per annum.
Group Financial Statements 2008 Annual Report and Accounts 83 Mouchel Group plc Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2008 continued 24 Financial instruments The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and price risk in varying degrees but all have relatively low levels of risk.
For this reason the Group has not undertaken hedging or complex financial instruments to mitigate these particular risks.
Interest rate risk arises from long-term pounds sterling borrowings issued at variable rates.
Group policy is to hedge a proportion of the drawn revolving credit facility.
Details of the Groups financial risk management objectives and policies are provided in note 1v.
The financial instruments of the Group comprise bank loan facilities, internal cash resources and debtors and creditors arising from normal trading activities.
The Groups policy is to manage the financial instruments centrally to provide both the working capital and the investment funds necessary for ongoing operations and future development.
The majority of UK projects and contracts are in pounds sterling, and otherwise are in the currencies in which the majority of the costs are denominated.
The Groups principal overseas subsidiaries have arranged working capital facilities in their local currency and it is unusual for them to contract in currencies other than their own functional currency.
Consideration is given to hedging against possible currency movements where considered appropriate.
It is the Groups policy not to trade in derivatives.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for.
None were identified as part of the review.

The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
To manage this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated as a cash flow hedge to hedge underlying debt obligations.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 July shows payable amounts as follows: Within Between Between Between Between More than 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total At 31 July 2008 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate: Other loans 1,165 1,171 736 103 3,175 Obligations under finance leases 179 173 127 479 Floating rate: Bank loan 47,500 86,240 133,740 Cash in hand 51,792 51,792 Cash flow hedges 337 337 Within Between Between Between Between More than 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total At 31 July 2007 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate: Obligations under finance leases 121 121 Floating rate: Cash in hand 19,007 19,007 Bank overdraft 16,176 16,176 Group Financial Statements 2008 Annual Report and Accounts 85 Mouchel Group plc Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 July 2008 continued 24 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk continued The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
Effect on profit Increase in before tax basis points 000 2008 0.25 334 2007 0.25 40 Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies.
In these operations, the working capital facilities are maintained in local currency with funds being remitted back to the UK to minimise exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group does not hedge against foreign currency exchange risk as balances in foreign currency are not significant to the Group.
The extent of foreign currency exposure is monitored on an ongoing basis.
All bonds and guarantees are funded out of the UK.
At 31 July 2008, if the euro had weakened strengthened by 1% against the UK pound with all other variables held constant, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 22,000 2007: 13,000 lower higher, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of UK pound-denominated trade receivables.
At 31 July 2008, if the UAE dirham had weakened strengthened by 1% against the UK pound with all other variables held constant, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 22,000 2007: 20,000 lower higher, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of UK pound-denominated trade receivables.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and unbilled revenue.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The Group manages these risks through a number of measures.
Counterparty risk on cash deposits is managed by adhering to the guidelines set by the Board.
Currently the limits are that up to 5,000,000 of cash can be deposited with any one party who has an AA rating or better.
Trade receivables and unbilled revenue are managed through set-up and authorisation policies for new customers.
It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
An assessment of credit quality of the customer is made as appropriate taking into account their financial position, past experience, external agency ratings and other factors.
Where possible, the risk is mitigated by use of advanced payments.
Group policy is not to apply individual credit limits to trade and other receivables, although total exposure and payment performance are monitored monthly both at individual project and client level.
The Group has a wide range of customers and in the view of management there are no concentrations of credit risk that cause concern.

Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the Group maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve which comprises undrawn borrowing facility and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flow.
In addition, the Groups liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these and monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements.
On 1 August 2007, an unsecured revolving credit facility of 125 million was put in place jointly with Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB to finance the acquisition of HBS Business Services Group Limited and provide capacity for the future growth and development of the business.
On 4 March 2008, the Group extended this facility to 185 million, following the decision to acquire Hedra plc.
Of the total facility, the original 125 million matures in August 2012 with the other 60 million maturing in September 2009.
As at 31 July 2008, the Group was in compliance with the financial covenants of the revolving credit facility.

Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
For capital management purposes, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the consolidated net borrowings to consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.

These schemes are a combination of defined benefit, defined contribution and third-party defined benefit schemes.
a Schemes accounted for on a defined contribution basis The Legal and General GPP Scheme, Parkman Defined Contribution Scheme and the Parkman Ireland Pension Scheme DC section are defined contribution schemes.
Upon the acquisition of HBS Business Services Group Limited and Hedra plc the Group became responsible for their defined contribution schemes.
Some employees who transferred to the Group under the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 1981 as amended TUPE remain members of their previous schemes, which are pre-funded defined benefit schemes.
Where under the terms of the contracts, the defined benefit liability remains with the relevant council, the Group accounts for these schemes as defined contribution schemes.
Cash contributions are recognised as pension costs and no asset or liability is shown on the balance sheet.
Group Financial Statements 2008 Annual Report and Accounts 98 Mouchel Group plc 36 Retirement benefit obligations continued b Schemes accounted for on a defined benefit basis third-party schemes MBS have admitted body status in the Teesside pre-funded defined benefit scheme, as employees of MBS who were previously employed by the local council remain members of the Teesside Pension Fund.
The assets and liabilities of this scheme are identified under retirement benefit obligations on the balance sheet and disclosed as third-party schemes in section d overleaf.
c Schemes accounted for on a defined benefit basis Group schemes The HBS Business Services Group Limited Pension Scheme, the Mouchel Superannuation Fund MSF and the Mouchel Staff Pension Scheme MSPS are funded defined benefit schemes and are disclosed as Group schemes in section d overleaf.
For the three principal defined benefit schemes that the Group is now responsible for, the future liabilities for benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate, trustee-administered funds.
The cost of these schemes is determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
In line with normal business practice these valuations are undertaken on a biennial basis for the MSF and the MSPS schemes and a triennial basis for the MBS scheme.
All schemes are closed to new entrants except for employees transferring to the Group under TUPE, where the Group is required to provide benefits which are broadly comparable to those provided under the Local Government Pension Scheme or another defined benefit scheme provided by the transferring employer.
Given the membership of the schemes, under the projected unit credit method the current service cost would be expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The most recent full actuarial valuations for all of the schemes took place in March 2007.
