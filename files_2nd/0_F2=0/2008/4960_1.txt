Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008 01 Company profile Drax is a power generation business operating principally in the commodity markets of power, coal, biomass and carbon.
We purchase coal, biomass and carbon allowances from both UK and international suppliers.
We currently generate around 7% of the UKs electricity and trade power in the electricity wholesale market of Great Britain.
Through the effective alignment of our trading, production and investment strategies we manage our exposure to commodity price risks, operate and maintain our generating facilities and pursue economic carbon abatement, all to deliver shareholder value.
We are embarking on a growth strategy for the business, with the intention of developing 900MW of dedicated biomass-red power generating capacity and to add to the value of the business in future years.
