Leases Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in borrowings.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Current Tax The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes account of the taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided for on timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date on a nondiscounted basis.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not there will be suitable taxable profits from which future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits The Company operates two types of pension schemes.
Firstly, there is a defined benefit retirement scheme for which the amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of net assets or liabilities represents the present value of the obligations offset by the fair value of the plan assets.
The cost of providing for the scheme is charged to the income statement over the periods relating to the employees service.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of the profit and loss account in retained earnings and presented in the reconciliation of movements in equity shareholders funds note 41.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants with effect from 6 April 2006.
For employees who do not participate in the above scheme the Company makes payments in respect of pensions directly to the employee.
These employees have the option to invest in a defined contribution scheme which the Group has set up or they may make their own arrangements.
108 Notes to the Company accounts 35 Accounting policies continued Share-based payments From the grant date the fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as a personnel expense in the income statement.
The fair value of each option or share appreciation right is determined using either a Black-Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo projection model, depending on the type of the award.
Market related performance conditions are reflected in the fair value of the share.
Non-market related performance conditions are allowed for using a separate assumption about the number of awards expected to vest: the final charge made reflects the numbers actually vested on the basis that non-market conditions are met.
Share options and own shares held In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 25 National Insurance Contributions on Share Option Gains UITF 25 the Company provides in full for the employers national insurance liability estimated to arise on the future exercise of share options granted.
As required under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts UITF 38 the cost to the Company of own shares held is shown as a deduction from shareholders funds within the profit and loss account.
Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of the Companys own shares in the ESOP trust is shown separately in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds.
Dividend reinvestment program Under the Companys Dividend Reinvestment Plan, shareholders can elect for the whole of their cash dividends to be reinvested in Lonmin Plc shares which are purchased on their behalf in the market.
All cash dividends are paid to the Registrars who use the dividends of participants in the plan to fund these purchases.
Accordingly, no new shares are issued, dividends are paid and accounted for in the normal way, and there are no special accounting requirements for the programme.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency of the Group entities using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of transactions.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historic rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit and loss, except for differences arising on the retranslation of available for sale equity instruments, or qualifying cash hedges, which are recognised directly in equity.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Research and development Research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure which meets the recognition criteria for an intangible asset under IAS 38 Intangible Assets, is capitalised and then amortised over the useful economic life of the developed asset, otherwise it is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Borrowing costs related to the development of qualifying assets are capitalised.
Other development expenditure is recognised in profit and loss as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses where it can be demonstrated that the expenditure will result in completion of an asset available for use or sale which will result in future economic benefit arising for the Group.
