58 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 31 December 2008 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 3.3 Risk management objectives continued c Liquidity risk continued In the current economic conditions, with severely restricted liquidity and limited access to new borrowing facilities in capital markets generally, and the real estate sector in particular, further downward pressure on valuations is possible in the forthcoming years.
At 31 December 2008 there were a number of loans on the UK portfolio that although not technically in breach, would have breached loan-to-value LTV covenants if the lenders concerned had commissioned valuations at the balance sheet date.
For all such loans the Group has the unfettered right to place cash on deposit with the lender to remedy such covenant breaches were they to be formally assessed.
The total amount of cash required to remedy all such potential covenant breaches at 31 December 2008 is not significant to the Group.
If valuations continue to fall, this could lead to further actual LTV covenant breaches.
In advance of this stage we will discuss potential breaches with lenders, which could lead to re-negotiation or possible waiving of this condition, particularly in cases where all other covenants are complied with.
On our Continental European assets, our LTV covenants have no such potential breaches at 31 December 2008, and are non-existent on several of our buildings.
The table below analyses the Groups contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities, as at the balance sheet date, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts represent undiscounted cash-flows.
Amounts due within 1 year are equivalent to the carrying values in the balance sheet as the impact of discounting is not significant in respect of this.
