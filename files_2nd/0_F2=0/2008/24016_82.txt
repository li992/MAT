Distributable capital reserves Under the terms of the Companys Articles of Association, sums standing to the credit of capital reserves are distributable only by way of redemption or purchase of any of the Companys own shares, for so long as the Company carries on business as an Investment Company.
Company Law states that Investment Companies may only distribute accumulated realised profits.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales ICAEW, in its technical guidance TECH 01 08, states that profits arising out of a change in fair value of assets, recognised in accordance with Accounting Standards, may be distributed, provided the change recognised can be readily converted into cash.
Securities listed on a recognised stock exchange are generally regarded as being readily convertible into cash and hence gains in respect of such investments held at the balance sheet date, currently included within the reserve arising on investments held, may be regarded as distributable under Company Law.
This technical interpretation of the meaning of distributable reserves would, as a consequence, give rise at 31 December 2008 to capital reserves available for distribution of approximately 1,356m, and non-distributable capital reserves, excluding the capital redemption reserve, of approximately 38m.
