 a Financialriskfactors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Groups treasury function seeks to ensure that sufficient funding is available to meet foreseeable needs, maintains reasonable headroom for contingencies and manages inflation and interest rate risk.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group relate to interest rate and counterparty risk.
These risks and treasury operations are managed by the Group Director of Finance in accordance with policies established by the Board.
Major transactions are individually approved by the Board.
Treasury activities are reported to the Board and are subject to review by internal audit.
Financial instruments are used to raise finance, manage risk and optimise the use of surplus funds.
The Group does not engage in speculative activity.
i Market risk The Group has a policy of maintaining at least 50% of interest bearing liabilities at fixed rates.
The Group uses a combination of fixed rate and index-linked borrowings and fixed rate interest swaps as cash flow hedges of future variable interest payments to achieve this policy.
At the year end 58% of net borrowings were at fixed rates and 20% index-linked.
The notional principal amounts of the interest rate swaps are used to determine settlement under those swaps and are not, therefore, an exposure for the Group.
These instruments are analysed in note 26.
The interest rate for index-linked debt is based upon an RPI measure which is also used in determining the amount of income from customers in South West Water.
The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets upon which the net return fluctuates from market risk.
Deposit interest receivable is expected to fluctuate in line with interest payable on floating rate borrowings.
Consequently the Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
At 31 March 2008 if interest rates on net borrowings at that date had been 0.5% higher lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 1.0 million 2007 1.0 million lower higher.
ii Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure the Group has significant available funds for operations and planned expansions and facilities equivalent to at least one years forecast requirements are maintained at all times.
Details of undrawn committed facilities and short-term uncommitted facilities are provided in note 26.
Refinancing risk is managed under a Group policy which requires no more than 20% of Group net borrowings is permitted to mature in any financial year.
The Group and South West Water Limited have entered into covenants with lenders.
Whilst terms vary, these typically provide for limits on gearing primarily based on South West Water Limiteds Regulatory Capital Value and Viridor Limiteds EBITDA and interest cover.
More details are provided in the Directors report on page 33.

Further information on the credit risk relating to trade receivables is given in note 21.
Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative instruments.
The Board has agreed a policy for managing such risk which is controlled through credit limits, counterparty approvals and rigorous monitoring procedures.
The Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk.
The Groups surplus funds are usually placed in short-term fixed interest deposits or the overnight money markets.
All deposits are with counterparties which have a credit rating threshold approved by the Board.

 continued b  The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to minimise the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group seeks to maintain a balance of returns to shareholders through dividends and an appropriate capital structure of debt and equity for each business segment and the Group.
The Group monitors capital risk on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net borrowings divided by total capital.
Net borrowings are analysed in note 36 and are calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash deposits.
Total capital is calculated as total shareholders equity plus net borrowings.
The gearing ratios at 31 March 2008 and 2007 were: 2008 2007 m m Net borrowings note 36 1,763.8 1,557.3 Total shareholders equity 640.3 627.2 Total capital 2,404.1 2,184.5 Gearing ratio 73% 71% South West Water Limited is also monitored on the basis of the ratio of its net borrowings to Regulatory Capital Value.

The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial instruments which are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions which are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future net cash flows.
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate which is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
