2 Presentation changes a Change to operating segments In November 2006, the IASB issued IFRS 8, Operating Segments.
Although its requirements are applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, the Group has decided to adopt IFRS 8 early and reflect its impact in these financial statements.
The Group has determined its operating segments along regional lines and the results for the year are presented on this basis, using UK Life and UK General Insurance within the United Kingdom, Europe, North America, Asia Pacific and Aviva Investors as the main segments.
i The UK general insurance business covers the Groups UK general insurance business and includes the results of Aviva Re, the Groups captive reinsurance business and agencies in run off.
ii The UK Life segment includes the result of the UK health business which it manages.
iii Europe incorporates all European operations excluding the UK as set out above: iv North America is made up of our life business in the United States and general insurance business in Canada: v Asia Pacific includes all our Asian and Australian businesses: and, vi Aviva Investors comprises the Aviva Investors UK, France, the United States, Canada, and the international fund management businesses.
b Restatement of prior year figures i Restatement for the change in accounting policy for latent reserves As part of the Companys aim to continuously improve the relevance and reliability of its external financial reporting, Aviva undertook a review of the Groups General Insurance Reserving Policy in 2008.
As part of this review, the Group concluded that estimating our latent claim provisions on an undiscounted basis, and discounting back to current values, represented an improvement to the existing estimation technique.
This approach is in line with best practice for long-term liabilities and moves the measurement of latent claims onto a more economic basis, consistent with our internal model for economic capital and the measurement model being proposed for both IFRS Phase II and Solvency II.
This approach also improves consistency with the reporting of other long-tail classes of business which are already being discounted, namely certain London Market latent claims and our Dutch Permanent Health and Injury Business.
The discount rate that has been applied is based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims.
The discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.
The range of discount rates used is shown in note 38c and depends on the duration of the claim and the reporting date.
We estimate that latent claims will be payable for around the next 35 to 40 years with an average duration of 15 years.
The application of discounting to our latent claims reserves represents a change in accounting policy and has therefore been applied retrospectively.
The cumulative impact of discounting on our opening reserves as at 1 January 2007 is to reduce insurance liabilities by 214 million and reinsurance assets by 61 million, and to increase retained earnings by 153 million.
These have been treated as prior year adjustments in these financial statements.
The impact of the change in accounting policy on the general insurance and health claims provisions and our results for the year ended 31 December 2007 and the opening 1 January 2007 position is set out below.

ii Consolidation of managed funds The Group manages a number of specialised investment vehicles around the world, in which our insurance and investment funds have invested.
The Groups percentage ownership in these vehicles can fluctuate from day to day according to the Groups and third party participation in them, and control is determined based on an analysis of the guidance in IAS 27.
During 2008, we identified that certain such vehicles required consolidation in accordance with IAS 27 which therefore results in grossing up assets and liabilities for the effect of the third party participation.
As a result, certain balance sheet categories have been restated for the gross up.
This resulted in increases to cash and cash equivalents 315 million, investment property 314 million, debt securities 2,375 million, equity securities 2,811 million, and net asset value attributable to unitholders 1,671 million, and a decrease to other investments 4,144 million as at 31 December 2007.
The impact on the 2007 income statement has been to restate net investment income and fee and commission expense by reducing both by 139 million and, in the 2007 cash flow statement, to increase cash flows from operating activities by 101 million.
In addition, certain property investment vehicles, which were consolidated in accordance with IAS 27, required restatement in the year ended 31 December 2007 to reanalyse amounts previously classified as minority interests to net asset value attributable to unitholders.
This change recognises that the property investment vehicles are unit trusts and, as a result, the third party holding should have been recognised as a liability rather than as a non-controlling interest.
Prior year comparatives have been restated with a reduction in minority interests and an increase in amounts due to unitholders of 758 million at 31 December 2007 and 431 million at 1 January 2007.
None of these adjustments has any impact on profit for the period, operating profit or earnings per share in the full year 2007, nor on retained earnings, net assets or total equity at either 1 January 2007 or 31 December 2007. iii Treatment of shares held by employee trusts As explained in note 30, employee share trusts have purchased the Companys shares in the market to satisfy awards under various share plans.
At 31 December 2007, these trusts held shares with a cost of 10 million which, on materiality grounds, were included within other financial assets rather than being shown as a deduction from total shareholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
In view of the Companys current policy of purchasing shares in the market rather than issuing new shares, which will lead to larger balances on this account, we have restated the 2007 figures accordingly.

d Other information Principal subsidiaries at 31 December 2008 are listed on pages 328 to 329.
One of the Groups subsidiaries, Delta Lloyd NV, is subject to the provisions of Dutch corporate law and particularly the Dutch structure company regime.
Under this regime, Delta Lloyd operates under a Supervisory Board which has a duty to have regard to the interests of a wide variety of stakeholders.
The Supervisory Board includes two Aviva Group representatives and is responsible for advising and supervising Delta Lloyds Executive Board.
The shareholder is one of the most important stakeholders to whom the Supervisory Board has a duty.
Dutch Law changed in October 2004 to ensure that Supervisory Board directors in Dutch companies were henceforth to be elected by a companys shareholders voting on nominations made by its Supervisory Board and the Works Council.
Under the previous system, Supervisory Board directors appointed their own successors.
In 2006, Delta Lloyd commenced proceedings against Aviva plc to try to compel the Company to adhere to the system that existed prior to the change in the law, on the basis of agreements they say were entered into in 1973 when the Group acquired Delta Lloyd.
The Company disputes these claims and does not expect the litigation, whatever its outcome, to have any adverse effect on the financial or operational performance of Delta Lloyd or the Group.
The court gave a judgement in 2008, requiring Aviva to adhere to the previous system of appointment, which Aviva is appealing.

This includes 287 million for the cost savings initiatives in the UK life and general insurance businesses and Europe, which have delivered 337 million annualised cost savings in the year.
Also included are integration costs of 39 million which mainly relate to the work to set up our global asset management operation, Aviva Investors.
Exceptional items We have reported exceptional items of 551 million 2007: nil in the year.
These include 142 million for closing or exiting non-core business operations such as the lifetime wrap platform and The British School of Motoring in the UK and the structured settlement business in the United States.
The costs also include 304 million after reinsurance for the discounted cost of strengthening our latent claims provisions, mainly in the UK, and 126 million for the settlement agreed by our Netherlands life business for its unit-linked policyholders, following an industry-wide challenge on the level of fees.
The remaining balance relates to brand migration costs of 37 million offset by 58 million benefit from settlement of a disputed Australian tax liability and the consequent release of a provision for interest charges.
In the table above, the 304 million relating to strengthening of latent claims provisions is included in change in insurance liabilities, with the remaining 247 million being included in other expenses.
Impairment of financial investments Group policy is to recognise an impairment on available for sale AFS equity securities when there has been a prolonged or significant decline in their fair value below their cost.
Although management believes that these equity securities will ultimately recover their value, there can be no certainty that this will happen as, unlike fixed maturity securities, the value of an equity security cannot be recovered in full by holding it to maturity.

The Group focuses instead on an operating profit measure that incorporates an expected return on investments supporting its long-term business.
This note explains the methodology behind this.
a Definitions Operating profit for long-term business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with consistent allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities.
Operating profit includes the effect of variance in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, and the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions.
Changes due to economic items, such as market value movements and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside operating profit.
b Economic volatility The investment variances and economic assumption changes excluded from the long-term business operating profit are as follows: Long-term business 2008 2007 m m Investment variances and economic assumption changes 1,631 15 The deepening global financial crisis has led to significantly negative investment variances in 2008.
The variances primarily relate to debt securities, where the unprecedented widening of credit spreads drove down market values, and to a lesser extent from falling equity and property values.
For with-profits and unit-linked business the decline in asset values is largely offset by a corresponding reduction in liabilities.
However for other non-profit business and surplus shareholder funds, the reduction in asset values was only partly mitigated by movements in liabilities.
Although equity markets suffered major downturns, the profit impact was limited by hedging activity in the Netherlands and limited shareholder exposure elsewhere in the Group.
Aviva plc 168 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 8 Long-term business economic volatility continued Major items included in the economic items for 2008 are as follows: additional credit default provisions of 550 million for corporate bonds and commercial mortgages backing UK annuity business: the impact of market movements on guarantees and options in France and the Netherlands of 260 million: widening credit spreads on assets backing participating business in Spain, with a charge to net income of 220 million: and in the USA the impact of credit spread widening on certain assets backing funding agreements that are classified as fair value through profit or loss, and write-downs on assets classified as available for sale, of 430 million.
This compares to a broadly neutral net impact on profit in 2007, when favourable investment variances in the Europe region were largely offset by negative effects in the USA and UK.
c Methodology The expected investment returns and corresponding expected movements in long-term business liabilities are calculated separately for each principal long-term business unit.
The expected return on investments for both policyholder and shareholders funds is based on opening economic assumptions applied to the expected funds under management over the reporting period.
Expected investment return assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each financial year.
The same margins are applied on a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free yields, to obtain investment return assumptions for equities and properties.
Expected funds under management are equal to the opening value of funds under management, adjusted for sales and purchases during the period arising from expected operating experience.
The actual investment return is affected by differences between the actual and expected funds under management and changes in asset mix, as well as movements in interest rates.
To the extent that these differences arise from the operating experience of the long-term business, or management decisions to change asset mix, the effect is included in the operating profit.
The residual difference between actual and expected investment return is included in investment variances, outside operating profit but included in profit before tax.
The movement in liabilities included in operating profit reflects both the change in liabilities due to the expected return on investments and the impact of experience variances and assumption changes for non-economic items.
The effect of differences between actual and expected experience on liabilities, and changes to economic assumptions used to value liabilities, are taken outside operating profit.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
For other long-term business the profit impact of economic volatility depends on the degree of matching of assets and liabilities, and exposure to financial options and guarantees.
d Assumptions The expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS.
Where assets are classified as fair value through profit or loss, the Group has applied the same real-world economic assumptions for fixed interest securities, equities and properties as are used under MCEV principles in 2008, and under EEV principles in 2007.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected investment return are: Fixed interest Equities Properties 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % % % % % United Kingdom 5.7 4.6 9.2 7.6 7.7 6.6 Eurozone 4.8 4.0 8.3 7.0 6.8 6.0 For 2008 the fixed interest reference rate is the one-year spot rate for risk free swaps in the relevant currency at the start of the year.
This is adjusted for different classes of fixed interest securities to reflect current market yields.
The expected returns for equities and property assets include risk margins above the reference rate of 3.5% and 2% respectively.
Where fixed interest securities are classified as available for sale, such as in the United States, the expected investment return comprises the expected interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase.

This note gives details of the longer term return calculation and the relevant assumptions, as well as the economic assumption changes on our general insurance and health business.
a The short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes attributable to the non-long-term business result and reported outside operating profit were as follows: Non-long-term business 2008 2007 m m Short-term fluctuation in investment return see b below 819 184 Economic assumption changes see g below 94 2 913 182 b The longer term investment return and short-term fluctuation are as follows: Non-long-term business 2008 2007 m m Net investment income note 4b i 522 1,115 Internal charges included under other headings 73 18 449 1,133 Analysed between: Longer term investment return, reported within operating profit 1,268 1,317 Short-term fluctuation in investment return, reported outside operating profit 819 184 449 1,133 c The longer term investment return is calculated separately for each principal non-long-term business unit.
In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer term rate of investment return.
The longer term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.
Aviva plc 170 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 9 Longer term investment return and economic assumption changes for non-long-term business continued d The total assets supporting the general insurance and health business, which contribute towards the longer term return were 19,576 million 2007: 18,291 million.
For other operations the longer term return reflects interest income earned in the Netherlands bank and retail mortgage divisions.

As explained in accounting policy K, provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims.
The discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period, with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.

The tests led to impairment of goodwill of 68 million in 2008 2007: 10 million.
Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives have been tested for impairment in these businesses as follows: United Kingdom i Long-term business The United Kingdom long-term business goodwill balance is split across five cash generating units, with no individual balance exceeding 25 million.
As disclosed in note 6, the wrap platform of the United Kingdom long-term business was terminated during the year.
As a result of this termination, the goodwill relating to this business was impaired and a charge of 20 million has been recognised as an exceptional item in the income statement.
ii General insurance, RAC and health Following the reorganisation of the reporting structure for the UKs general insurance business during 2007 and 2008, further integrating the operations, management and reporting of businesses acquired with the RAC, the composition of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated has been reassessed.
It has been determined that goodwill should be allocated to a single general insurance, RAC and health cash-generating unit.
The analysis above reflects the revised allocation of goodwill.
No impairment of goodwill has arisen or been released as a result of the reallocation.
Aviva plc 178 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16 Goodwill continued The recoverable amount of the UK general insurance, RAC and health unit has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 10.2%.
Cash flows beyond that three year period have been extrapolated using a steady 2.5% growth rate.
The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash-generating unit including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management, and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant UK industry sectors: Some of the assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, customer numbers, premium rate and fee income changes, claims inflation and commission rates: and Growth rates represent the rates used to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period and have been based upon latest information available regarding future and past growth rates, including external sources of data such as ABI Annual Market Statistics.
As disclosed in note 17 d, as a result of the classification of The British School of Motoring Limited and its subsidiaries as held for sale, an impairment charge of 20 million in respect of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives has been recognised.
Europe Long-term business The recoverable amount of long-term business cash generating units in the Europe region, with the exception of the Netherlands, has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The first step of the test was to compare the carrying value of each cash generating unit, including goodwill, to the Market Consistent Embedded Value MCEV of that cash generating unit.
If the MCEV is less than the carrying value of a cash generating unit the present value of profits from expected new business for that cash generating unit is considered.
For European long-term business cash generating units a key assumption used for the calculation was: Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is calculated in accordance with the Market Consistent Embedded Value MCEV principles.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life business and the value of the in-force business.
General insurance, health and other The recoverable amount of general insurance, health and other non-life cash generating units in the Europe region has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
Value in use is calculated for each cash generating unit using a discounted cash flow projection based on business plans and growth assumptions approved by management for each cash generating unit and discounted at a risk discount rate appropriate for each cash generating unit.
iii France long-term business The recoverable amount of the indefinite life intangible asset has been assessed as part of the recoverable amount of the French long-term business cash generating unit.
The MCEV of the French long-term business was significantly greater than its carrying value, including indefinite life intangible assets.
iv Ireland long-term business The MCEV of the Irish long-term business is greater than its carrying value so the recoverable value will be significantly in excess of its carrying value, including goodwill.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 179 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 16 Goodwill continued v Ireland general insurance and health The recoverable amount of the Irish general insurance and health business exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit for an initial three year period represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the Irish economy.
Some of the assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, premium rate changes, claims inflation and commission rates: Growth rate of 4.6% represents the rate used to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period.
Prices are assumed to remain static in the foreseeable future and volumes are assumed to increase in line with real GDP: and A risk adjusted discount rate of 8.1%.
vi Italy long-term business This calculation is an  appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
Key assumptions in addition to MCEV principles used for the calculation were: New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a period.
This is initially based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management: Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements estimate of future growth of 2.0%: and Risk adjusted discount rate of 10.2% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate includes a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.
As a result of an Italian off-shore long-term business entering run off, the goodwill relating to this business of 2 million has been fully impaired and recognised as an impairment charge in the income statement.
For the rest of the Italian long-term business the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill.
vii Italy non-life The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit for an initial three year period represents the operating profit in the most recent business plans, approved by management and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the Italian economy: Growth rate of 2.5% represents the rate used to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period: and A risk adjusted discount rate of 10.2%.
viii Netherlands long-term, general insurance, health and fund management The recoverable amount of the Netherlands life and general insurance and health cash generating units has been determined on the basis of a value in use calculation.
This calculation is an appraisal value and is based on the discounted expected future cash flows from the operations over a 25-year period.
Expected cash flows for future periods have been obtained from the plan figures for a three year period.
Expected cash flows for later periods have been extrapolated, taking into account the growth rate.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Expected cash flows for future periods have been obtained from the plan figures for a three year period: Growth rate of 2.0% represents the rate applied to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, for the life and general insurance business.
In the fund management business growth rates are based on management's prudent best estimate of future growth: and Risk-adjusted discount rate of 9.2% for long-term, general insurance and health business, and 11.53% for fund management business represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate includes a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experiences in future years may differ from those assumed.
Aviva plc 180 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16 Goodwill continued During the year, goodwill allocated to a non-insurance cash-generating unit in Belgium, was tested for impairment.
Following the impairment test, an impairment charge of 46 million has been recognised in the income statement.
After recognition of this impairment charge, the recoverable amount of the Dutch cash generating units exceeds their carrying value.
An increase in the risk adjusted discount rate of 1% would result in the recoverable amount of the ABN Amro cash generating unit being equal to its carrying value.
ix Spain long-term business This calculation is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill.
This is initially based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management: Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements conservative estimate of future growth of 3.0%.
This growth rate is in line with industry expectations: and Risk adjusted discount rate of 10.1% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.
x United States long-term business The recoverable amount of the United States long-term cash generating unit has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
This calculation is an  appraisal value and is based on an embedded value of the business the total of the net worth of the life business and the value of the in-force business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
The value in use exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is based on projected cash flows of the business including expected investment returns.
Risk adjusted discount rate of 10% is used to calculate the embedded value: New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a period.
This is initially based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management: Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements estimate of future growth of 5% for life and annuity business: and Risk adjusted discount rate of 12% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate includes an additional margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.

b Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives comprise: i the RAC brand, and the value of the Union Financire fide France Banque distribution channel, where the existing lives of the assets and their competitive position in, and the stability of, their respective markets support this classification: and ii the bancassurance distribution agreement with Banco Popolare, signed in December 2007, which is initially for ten years, with five-year automatic renewal periods.
It is expected to be renewed indefinitely, due to the unfavourable terms of the put option for failure to renew.
c During the year the Italian business unit finalised the valuation of Avipop Assicurazioni SpA which was acquired during 2007, and its bancassurance agreement with Banco Popolare.
This has resulted in a reallocation of 31 million from intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to goodwill and other assets.
Impairment testing of these intangibles is covered in note 16 b.
Other intangible assets with finite useful lives consist primarily of the value of bancassurance and other distribution agreements.
d As disclosed in note 6, the wrap platform of the United Kingdom long-term business was terminated during the year.
As a result of this termination the intangible asset relating to this business was impaired and a charge of 32 million has been recognised as an exceptional item in the income statement.
The impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives relates to the classification of The British School of Motoring Limited and its subsidiaries as held for sale.
This has been recognised as an exceptional item in the income statement.
e Following a review for indicators of impairment of the finite-lived intangible assets held by the UK general Insurance, RAC and health business, an impairment charge of 9 million has been recognised in the income statement in respect of the intangible asset representing the right to future income from a book of creditor business.
The impairment charge arose as a result of current adverse trading experience.

d Impairment testing CIMB Aviva Assurance Berhad and CIMB Aviva Takaful Berhad The Groups investments in CIMB Aviva Assurance Berhad and CIMB Aviva Takaful Berhad have been tested for impairment by comparing their carrying values which include goodwill which arose on their acquisition with their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amounts for both the investments have been determined based on value in use calculations.
This calculation is an  appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
The recoverable amounts exceeds the carrying values of both the investments.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: The calculations use cash flow projections based on the policy portfolio existing at the valuation date and the future sales based on plans approved by management covering the subsequent three year period.
The cashflows from existing policy portfolio is calculated using best estimate assumptions, which have been supported by experience investigation where available and prudent estimates typical for the market where experience investigations are not available: The calculations use a risk adjusted discount rate of 10.5%: and New sales beyond the three year period have been extrapolated using a growth rate of 7.5%.

d Impairment testing RBS Life Investments Limited and RBSG Collective Investments Limited The Groups investments in RBS Life Investments Limited and RBSG Collective Investments Limited have been tested for impairment by comparing their carrying values which include goodwill which arose on their acquisition with their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amounts for both investments have been determined based on value in use calculations, using an appraisal value methodology.
The appraisal value comprises MCEV and a value of future new business.
Future new business is valued using a similar approach as used for the in-force business.
The value of 2009 planned new business is based on planned volumes, planned margins for manufactured business and current margins for adopted business all approved by management.
This value is then multiplied by an annuity in perpetuity factor to give the value of all years of future new business and then discounted from mid-2009 back to the valuation date.
The annuity factor allows for new business growth of 4.5% and a risk discount rate of 7.3%.
This value is adjusted to allow for future expense over-runs and under-runs, based on the projected expenses and sales volumes.
The recoverable amounts exceed the carrying values of both the investments.
Banca Network Investimenti SpA The Groups investment in Banca Network Investimenti SpA has been tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value which includes goodwill which arose on its acquisition with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation prepared by an external valuation expert.
Value in use was calculated using a discounted cash flow projection based on business plans and growth assumptions approved by management and discounted at an appropriate risk discount rate.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: A cash flow project based on a three year plan period.
Cash flows beyond that three year period have been extrapolated using a steady 2% growth rate: Risk adjusted discount rate of 8.5% based on the weighted average cost of capital of similar Italian listed companies: and As a result of the testing, an impairment of 12 million has been recognised.

These values are assessed in accordance with the relevant parts of the current RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards in the UK, and with current local valuation practices in other countries.
This assessment, on the basis of Existing Use Value and in accordance with UK Practice Statement 1.3, is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction, after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion, assuming that the buyer is granted vacant possession of all parts of the property required by the business and disregarding potential alternative uses.
The valuation assessment adopts market-based evidence and is in line with guidance from the International Valuation Standards Committee and the requirements of IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment, for all but specialised-use properties which are valued on a depreciated replacement cost DRC basis as permitted by paragraph 33 of IAS 16.
If owner-occupied properties were stated on a historical cost basis, the carrying amount would be 414 million 2007: 301 million.

This note gives details of the relevant transactions.
a Description of arrangements i United Kingdom In a long-term business subsidiary NUER, the beneficial interest in certain portfolios of lifetime mortgages has been transferred to five special purpose securitisation companies the ERF companies, in return for initial consideration and, at later dates, deferred consideration.
The deferred consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF companies after meeting all their obligations to the noteholders, loan providers and other third parties in the priority of payments.
The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed and floating rate notes by the ERF companies.
All the shares in the ERF companies are held by independent companies, whose shares are held on trust.
Although NUER does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent companies, it retains control of the residual or ownership risks related to them, and they have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.
NUER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where NUER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted in order to effect a further advance.
NUER has purchased subordinated notes and granted subordinated loans to some of the ERF companies.
These have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the ERF companies in the consolidated balance sheet.
ii Netherlands and Belgium In three subsidiaries, Delta Lloyd Levensverzekering NV DLL, Amstelhuys NV AMS, and Delta Lloyd Bank Belgium NV SA DLB, the principal benefits of certain portfolios of mortgage loans have been transferred to a number of special purpose securitisation companies, which were funded primarily through the issue of fixed and floating rate notes.
All the shares in the securitisation companies are held by independent trustee companies.
Although DLL, AMS and DLB do not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the securitisation companies or their parent companies, they retain control of the residual or ownership risks related to them, and these companies have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.
DLL, AMS and DLB have no right, nor any obligation, to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans before the optional call date, other than in certain circumstances where they are in breach of warranty.
Delta Lloyd companies have purchased notes in the securitisation companies, which have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the securitisation companies in the consolidated balance sheet.
iii General In all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the noteholders and do not intend to provide such support.
Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that noteholders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principle and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that noteholders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.

An active market is one in which transactions for the asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Examples are listed equities in active markets, listed debt securities in active markets and quoted unit trusts in active markets.
Internal models with significant observable market parameters Level 2 Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly.
If the asset has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset.
Level 2 inputs include the following: Quoted prices for similar ie not identical assets in active markets: Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment spreads, loss severities, credit risks, and default rates : Inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means market-corroborated inputs.
Examples of these are securities measured using discounted cash flow models based on market observable swap yields, investment property measured using market observable information, and listed debt or equity securities in a market that is inactive.
Internal models with significant unobservable market parameters Level 3 Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset at the measurement date or market information for the inputs to any valuation models.
As such, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset.
Examples are certain private equity investments and private placements.
The majority of the Groups investments are valued based on quoted market information or observable market data.
A small percentage 1% of total assets recorded at fair value, are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3 investments.
Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third-party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible.
Whilst such valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing one or more of the assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the fair value significantly.

The majority of the Groups stock lending transactions occurs in the UK, where investments are lent to EEA-regulated, locally-domiciled counterparties and governed by agreements written under English law.
The Group receives collateral in order to reduce the credit risk of these arrangements.
Collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.
Transfer of title always occurs for collateral received, although no market risk or economic benefit is taken.
The level of collateral held is monitored regularly, with further collateral obtained where this is considered necessary to manage the Groups risk exposure.
In September 2008, a counterparty default led to the sale of the collateral held and the purchase of securities lent to that counterparty.
This process was completed without any loss to the Group.
In certain markets, the Group or the Groups appointed stock lending managers obtain legal ownership of the collateral received and can re-pledge it as collateral elsewhere or sell outright in the absence of default.
The carrying amounts of financial assets received and pledged in this manner at 31 December 2008 were 18,486 million and 322million respectively 2007: 23,779 million and 4 million respectively.
The value of collateral that was actually sold or re-pledged in the absence of default was nil million 2007: nil.
In addition to the above, the Group has received and pledged cash collateral under stock lending arrangement that has been recognised on the balance sheet with a corresponding obligation or receivable for its return.
These latter balances are shown separately in notes 48 and 25 respectively.
ii Stock repurchase arrangements Included within financial investments are 383 million 2007: 358 million of debt securities and other fixed income securities which have been sold under stock repurchase arrangements.
The obligations arising under these arrangements are shown in note 48. iii Other arrangements In carrying on its bulk purchase annuity business, the Groups UK Life operation is required to place certain investments in trust on behalf of the policyholders.
Amounts become payable from the trust funds to the trustees if the Group were to be in breach of its payment obligations in respect of policyholder benefits.
At 31 December 2008, 474 million 2007:nil of financial investments were restricted in this way.
Certain financial investments are also required to be deposited under local laws in various overseas countries as security for the holders of policies issued in those countries.
Other investments are pledged as security collateral for bank letters of credit.

a Description of the plans The Group maintains a number of active stock option and award schemes.
These are as follows: i Savings-related options These are options granted under the Inland Revenue-approved Save As You Earn SAYE share option schemes in the UK and in Ireland.
Options are normally exercisable during the six month period following either the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the start of the relevant savings contract.
ii Executive share options These are options granted on various dates from 1998 to 2004, under the Aviva Executive Share Option Scheme or predecessor schemes.
Options granted between 1998 and 2000 were subject to the satisfaction of conditions relating to either the Companys return on equity shareholders funds ROE or its relative total shareholder return TSR against a chosen comparator group.
In respect of options granted from 2000 the performance condition has been a mixture of both ROE and TSR measures.
In all cases, performance is measured over a three-year performance period and the options are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of their grant.
iii Deferred bonus plan options These are options granted in 1999 and 2000 under the CGU Deferred Bonus Plan.
Participants who deferred their annual cash bonus in exchange for an award of shares of equal value also received a matching award over an equal number of share options.
The exercise of these options is not subject to the attainment of performance conditions.
These options are exercisable up to the tenth anniversary of their grant.
iv Long-term incentive plan awards These awards have been made under the Aviva Long-Term Incentive Plan 2005 and are described in Section b below and in the Directors remuneration report.

Shares which do not vest, lapse.
iii Shares to satisfy awards and options Prior to March 2003, it was the practice to satisfy awards and options granted under the executive incentive plans through shares purchased in the market and held by employee share trusts which were established for the purpose of satisfying awards under the various executive incentive plans and funded by the Company.
From March 2003 to July 2008, it was generally the Companys practice to satisfy the awards granted after March 2003 by the issue of new shares at the time of vesting.
However, since July 2008, it is the Companys practice to satisfy all awards and options using shares purchased in the market and held by employee trusts except where local regulations make it necessary to issue new shares.
Further details are given in note 30. c Movements in the year A summary of the status of the option plans as at 31 December 2008 and 2007, and changes during the years ended on those dates, is shown below.

i Share options The fair value of the options was estimated on the date of grant, based on the following weighted average assumptions: Weighted average assumption 2008 2007 Share price 518p 733.5p Exercise price 410p 563p Expected volatility 32.6% 24% Expected life 5.00 years 4.07 years Expected dividend yield 5.5% 3.83% Risk-free interest rate 4.4% 5.09% The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the options prior to its date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate was based on the yields available on UK government bonds as at the date of grant.
The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the options.
1,112,282 options granted after 7 November 2002 were exercised during the year 2007: 1,496,069. ii Share awards The fair value of the awards was estimated on the date of grant, based on the following weighted average assumptions: Weighted average assumption 2008 2007 Share price 608p 778.5p Expected volatility 25% 18.35% Expected volatility of comparator companies share price 26% 19% Correlation between Aviva and competitors share price 65% 53% Expected life 2.78 years 2.20 years Expected dividend yield 4.5% 3.83% Risk-free interest rate 3.9% 5.36% For awards with market-based performance conditions.
The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the options prior to its date of grant.

These shares were purchased in the market and are carried at cost less amounts charged to the income statement in prior years.
The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held in the trusts.
31 Preference share capital This note gives details of Aviva plcs preference share capital.
The preference share capital of the Company at 31 December 2008 was: 2008 2007 m m Authorised 200,000,000 cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 200 200 1,000,000,000 Sterling preference shares of 1 each 1,000 1,000 1,200 1,200 2008 2007 m m 700,000,000 Euro preference shares of 1 each 700 700 2008 2007 m m Issued and paid up 3 100,000,000 8 8% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 100 100 3 100,000,000 8 4% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 100 100 200 200 The Sterling preference shares, if issued and allotted, would rank, as to payment of a dividend and capital, ahead of the Companys ordinary share capital but behind the cumulative irredeemable preference shares currently in issue.
The issued preference shares are non-voting except where their dividends are in arrears, on a winding up or where their rights are altered.
On a winding up, they carry a preferential right of return of capital ahead of the ordinary shares.
The Company does not have a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets to the preference shareholders and therefore the directors may make dividend payments at their discretion.

They have no fixed redemption date but the Company may, at its sole option, redeem all but not part of the euro and sterling DCIs at their principal amounts on 28 November 2014 and 27 July 2020 respectively, at which dates the interest rates change to variable rates, or on any respective coupon payment date thereafter.
In addition, under certain circumstances defined in the terms and conditions of the issue, the Company may at its sole option: i substitute at any time not less than all of the DCIs for, or vary the terms of the DCIs so that they become, Qualifying Tier 1 Securities or Qualifying Upper Tier 2 Securities: ii substitute not less than all of the DCIs for fully paid non-cumulative preference shares in the Company.
These preference shares could only be redeemed on 28 November 2014 in the case of the euro DCIs and on 27 July 2020 in the case of the sterling DCIs, or in each case on any dividend payment date thereafter.
The Company has the right to choose whether or not to pay any dividend on the new shares, and any such dividend payment will be non-cumulative.
The Company has the option to defer coupon payments on the DCIs on any relevant payment date.
Deferred coupons shall be satisfied only in the following circumstances, all of which occur at the sole option of the Company: i Redemption: or ii Substitution by, or variation so they become, alternative Qualifying Tier 1 Securities or Qualifying Upper Tier 2 Securities: or iii Substitution by preference shares.
No interest will accrue on any deferred coupon.
Deferred coupons will be satisfied by the issue and sale of ordinary shares in the Company at their prevailing market value, to a sum as near as practicable to and at least equal to the relevant deferred coupons.
In the event of any coupon deferral, the Company will not declare or pay any dividend on its ordinary or preference share capital.
33 Merger reserve This note analyses the movements in the merger reserve during the year.

Merger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated balance sheet, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiarys own share capital and share premium account.
The merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985.
The balance on the reserve has arisen through the mergers of Commercial Union, General Accident and Norwich Union companies, forming Aviva plc in 2000, together with the acquisition of RAC plc in 2005.

The Groups regulated subsidiaries are required to hold sufficient capital to meet acceptable solvency levels based on applicable local regulations.
Their ability to transfer retained earnings to the UK parent companies is therefore restricted to the extent these earnings form part of local regulatory capital.

Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by Norwich Union Life & Pensions and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
In France, where the majority of policyholders benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
In the Netherlands, the balance of profits, after providing appropriate returns for policyholders and after tax, accrues for the benefit of the shareholders.
The bases for determining returns for policyholders are complex, but are consistent with methods and criteria followed generally in the Netherlands.
In addition, a substantial number of policies provide benefits that are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In the United States, there are two main business segments protection products and accumulation products.
Protection products include interest-sensitive whole life, term life, universal life and indexed life insurance policies.
The accumulation product segment includes traditional fixed and indexed deferred annuities for individuals and funding agreements for business customers.
In addition, there are two closed blocks of participating contracts arising from demutualisations of subsidiary companies.
All products are classified as insurance contracts except for the funding agreements and term certain immediate annuities, which are classified as non-participating investment contracts.
Aviva plc 214 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38 Insurance liabilities continued ii Group practice The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Groups life operations.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, mainly using the net premium method, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act.
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where discretion is permitted.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
Bonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision.
iii Methodology and assumptions There are two main methods of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts the net premium method and the gross premium method both of which involve the discounting of projected premiums and claims.
Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability.
The difference between this premium and the actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses.
This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses including those vesting following the most recent fund valuation, but no such provision is made for future regular or terminal bonuses.
However, this method makes implicit allowance for future regular or terminal bonuses already earned, by margins in the valuation discount rate used.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses and explicit allowance is also made for future regular bonuses, but not terminal bonuses.
a UK With-profit business The valuation of with-profit business uses the methodology developed for the Realistic Balance Sheet, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
The key elements of the Realistic Balance Sheet methodology are the with-profit benefit reserve WPBR and the present value of the expected cost of any payments in excess of the WPBR referred to as the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The realistic liability for any contract is equal to the sum of the WPBR and the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis, and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.
For a small proportion of business, the retrospective approach is not available or is inappropriate, so a prospective valuation approach is used instead, including allowance for anticipated future regular and final bonuses.
The items included in the cost of future policy-related liabilities include: Maturity Guarantees: Smoothing which can be negative : Guaranteed Annuity Options: GMP underpin on Section 32 transfers: and Expected payments under Mortgage Endowment Promise.
In the Provident Mutual and With-Profit sub-funds in NUL&P, this is offset by the expected cost of charges to WPBR to be made in respect of guarantees.
The cost of future policy-related liabilities is determined using a market-consistent approach and, in the main, this is based on a stochastic model calibrated to market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Non-marketrelated assumptions for example, persistency, mortality and expenses are based on experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 215 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 38 Insurance liabilities continued The principal assumptions underlying the cost of future policy related liabilities are as follows: Future investment return A risk-free rate equal to the spot yield on gilts, plus a margin of 0.1% is used.
The rates vary, according to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at 31 December 2008 being 3.58% 2007: 4.72% for a policy with ten years outstanding.
Volatility of investment return Volatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where available.
These are term-dependent, with specimen values for ten year terms as follows: Volatility 2008 2007 Equity returns 34.6% 25.5% Property returns 15% 15% Fixed interest yields 15.9% 10.9% The table above shows the volatility of fixed interest yields, set with reference to 20 year at-the-money swaption volatilities.
Future regular bonuses Annual bonus assumptions for 2009 have been set consistently with the year end 2008 declaration.
Future annual bonus rates reflect the principles and practices of the fund.
In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.
Mortality Mortality assumptions are set with regard to recent company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality table used 2008 2007 Assurances, pure endowments and Nil or Axx00 adjusted Nil or AM92 AF92 deferred annuities before vesting Pensions business after vesting and PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus pensions annuities in payment plus allowance for future allowance for future mortality mortality improvement improvement Non-profit business Conventional non-profit contracts, including those written in the with-profit funds, are valued using gross premium methods which discount projected future cash flows.
The cash flows are calculated using the amount of contractual premiums payable, together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, inflation, discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
For unit-linked and some unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash flows on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.
A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.

The net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.

A liability adequacy test is performed in line with IFRS requirements.
Where liabilities are based on current market interest rates and assets are valued at market value, the margin in the liability adequacy test is determined by comparison of the liabilities with the present value of best estimate cash flows.
For 2008 the yield curve basis has been revised from swap rates to a curve constructed from yields on collateralised AAA bonds: this is to avoid distortion from extremities observed in the swap curve under the dislocated market conditions.

The liability for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance is computed using the net level method, based on guaranteed interest and mortality rates as used in calculating cash surrender values.
The weighted average interest rate for all traditional life policy reserves in 2008 was 4.47% 2007: 4.46%.
Future policy benefit reserves for universal life insurance, indexed life, deferred annuity products and funding agreements are computed under a retrospective deposit method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges.
The weighted average interest crediting rates for universal life products were 4.77% in 2008 2007: 5.45%.
The range of interest crediting rates for deferred annuity products, excluding sales inducement payouts, was 2.50% to 6.00% in 2008 2007: 2.50% to 7.00%.
An additional liability is established for universal life contracts with death or other insurance benefit features, which is determined using an equally-weighted range of scenarios with respect to investment returns, policyholder lapses, benefit election rates, premium payout patterns and mortality.
The additional liability represents the present value of future expected benefits based on current product assumptions.
The indexed life and annuity products guarantee the return of principal to the customer, and credit interest based on certain indices.
A portion of the premium from each customer is invested in fixed income securities and is intended to cover the minimum guaranteed value.
A further portion of the premium is used to purchase derivatives to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the related indices.
Both the derivatives and the options embedded in the policy are valued at their fair value.
Deferred income reserves are established for fees charged for insurance benefit features which are assessed in a manner that is expected to result in higher profits in earlier years, followed by lower profits or losses in subsequent years.
The excess charges are deferred and amortised using the same assumptions and factors used to amortise deferred acquisition costs.
Shadow adjustments may be made to deferred acquisition costs, acquired value of in-force business, deferred income reserves and contract liabilities.
The shadow adjustments are recognised directly in equity so that unrealised gains or losses on investments that are recognised directly in equity affect the measurement of the liability, or related assets, in the same way as realised gains or losses.

iv Movements The following movements have occurred in the long-term business provisions during the year: 2008 2007 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 135,312 126,614 Provisions in respect of new business 13,414 10,470 Expected change in existing business provisions 6,423 6,280 Variance between actual and expected experience 9,401 877 Effect of adjusting to PS06 14 realistic basis 40 60 Impact of other operating assumption changes 812 95 Impact of economic assumption changes 604 909 Effect of special bonus to with-profit policyholders note 43b 1,728 Other movements 527 324 Change in liability recognised as an expense 4,393 3,843 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 1,872 571 Foreign exchange rate movements 23,397 4,284 Carrying amount at 31 December 156,188 135,312 c General insurance and health liabilities i Provisions for outstanding claims Delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and a substantial measure of experience and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
The reserves for general insurance and health are based on information currently available.
However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses LAE in respect of all claims that have already occurred.
The provisions established cover reported claims and associated LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE.
Outstanding claims provisions are based on undiscounted estimates of future claim payments, except for the following classes of business for which discounted provisions are held: Rate Mean term of liabilities Class 2008 2007 2008 2007 Netherlands Permanent health and injury 3.82% 3.87% 7 years 8 years Reinsured London Market business 3.56% 5.00% 8 years 8 years Latent claims 1.17% to 4.51% to 9 to 9 to 3.92% 5.21% 15 years 15 years As explained in note 2, the Groups accounting policy for discounting has been changed in 2008 to present all latent claims on a discounted basis.
The gross outstanding claims provision before discounting was 15,061 million 2007: 13,439 million.
The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 219 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 38 Insurance liabilities continued ii Assumptions Outstanding claims provisions are estimated based on known facts at the date of estimation.
Case estimates are generally set by skilled claims technicians, applying their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a companys past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also used where this is considered appropriate.
Claim development is separately analysed for each geographic area, as well as by each line of business.
Certain lines of business are also further analysed by claim type or type of coverage.
In addition, large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development.
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made regarding future rates of claims inflation or loss ratios.
Instead, the assumptions used are those implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based.
Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for example, to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from the range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
iii Movements The following changes have occurred in the general insurance and health claims provisions during the year: Restated 2008 2007 m m Carrying amount at 1 January as reported 12,941 12,718 Prior year adjustment impact of discounting on latent claims note 2b i 214 Carrying amount at 1 January restated 12,941 12,504 Impact of changes in assumptions 120 1 Claim losses and expenses incurred in the current year 8,720 8,273 Decrease in estimated claim losses and expenses incurred in prior years 828 956 Exceptional strengthening of general insurance latent claims provisions see below 356 Incurred claims losses and expenses 8,368 7,316 Less: Payments made on claims incurred in the current year 4,682 4,408 Payments made on claims incurred in prior years 4,307 3,686 Recoveries on claim payments 293 315 Claims payments made in the year, net of recoveries 8,696 7,779 Unwind of discounting 33 35 Other movements in the claims provisions 27 36 Changes in claims reserve recognised as an expense 322 392 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 128 175 Foreign exchange rate movements 1,613 654 Carrying amount at 31 December 14,360 12,941 The effect of changes in the main assumptions is given in note 42 and the economic assumption changes are explained in note 9.
Aviva plc 220 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38 Insurance liabilities continued Discount rate The discount rate that has been applied to latent claims reserves is based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency having regard to the expected settlement dates of the claims.
The range of discount rates used depends on the duration of the claims and is given in the table in section i above.
The duration of the claims span over 35 years, with the average duration being between 9 and 15 years depending on the geographical region.
Any change in discount rates between the start and the end of the accounting period is reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.
The sharp decline in interest rates in the second half of 2008 has resulted in an increase in the net discounted provision of 94 million.
Exceptional strengthening of latent claims provisions Separately and in addition to the decision to discount latent claims, our estimation of latent claims reserves in 2008 has been revised to reflect increasing market trends observed in mesothelioma claims.
The majority of the Groups latent claims reserves relate to mesothelioma based risks in the UK.
The Institute of Actuaries Asbestos Working Party report in 2008 contributed to our view that experience variances, which we had previously perceived as normal short-term volatility, reflected a real worsening of expected ultimate claims experience.
The market trend in mesothelioma claims has been fully reflected as a significant one-off strengthening of gross latent claims reserves in 2008 of 356 million, with a corresponding increase of 52 million in reinsurance recoverable.
The net increase of 304 million comprises 668 million on an undiscounted basis and discounting of 364 million.
Due to its size and the fact that this related to discontinued business, this one-off strengthening has been reported as an exceptional item below operating profit.
Whilst this is a significant step change, it should be noted that this reflects the long-term impact of the settlement of latent claims currently running at 30 million per annum, of which 25 million related to mesothelioma.
The number of claims is currently predicted to rise slightly in the period to 2015 and then diminish slowly over the next 30 years to 2045. d Loss development tables i Description of tables The tables that follow present the development of claim payments and the estimated ultimate cost of claims for the accident years 2001 to 2008.
The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident year.
For example, with respect to the accident year 2002, by the end of 2008 5,715 million had actually been paid in settlement of claims.
In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original estimated ultimate cost of claims of 6,250 million was re-estimated to be 6,056 million at 31 December 2008.
This decrease from the original estimate is due to the combination of a number of factors.
The original estimates will be increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.
In 2005, the year of adoption of IFRS, only five years were required to be disclosed.
This is being increased in each succeeding additional year, until ten years of information is included.
The Group aims to maintain strong reserves in respect of its non-life and health business in order to protect against adverse future claims experience and development.
As claims develop and the ultimate cost of claims become more certain, the absence of adverse claims experience will then result in a release of reserves from earlier accident years, as shown in the loss development tables.
However, in order to maintain overall reserve adequacy, the Group establishes strong reserves in respect of the current accident year 2008 where the development of claims is less mature and there is much greater uncertainty attaching to the ultimate cost of claims.
The release from prior accident year reserves during 2008 is also due to an improvement in the estimated ultimate cost of claims.
In the loss development tables shown above, the cumulative claim payments and estimates of cumulative claims for each accident year are translated into sterling at the exchange rates that applied at the end of that accident year.
The impact of using varying exchange rates is shown at the bottom of each table.
Disposals are dealt with by treating all outstanding and IBNR claims of the disposed entity as paid at the date of disposal.
The loss development tables above include information on asbestos and environmental pollution claims provisions from business written before 2001.
The undiscounted claim provisions, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business at 31 December 2008 were 1,019 million 2007: 323 million.
The movement in the year reflects exceptional strengthening of provisions by 668 million due to the increased market trend in mesothelioma claim notifications, other strengthening of 16 million 2007: 20 million, foreign exchange rate movements and timing differences between claim payments and reinsurance recoveries.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 223 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 38 Insurance liabilities continued e Provision for unearned premiums Movements The following changes have occurred in the provision for unearned premiums UPR during the year: 2008 2007 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 5,484 5,182 Premiums written during the year 11,934 11,369 Less: Premiums earned during the year 12,322 11,345 Changes in UPR recognised as income expense 388 24 Gross portfolio transfers and acquisitions 11 87 Foreign exchange rate movements 408 191 Carrying amount at 31 December 5,493 5,484 39 Liability for investment contracts This note analyses our investment contract liabilities by type of product and describes how we calculate these liabilities and what assumptions we have used.
a Carrying amount The liability for investment contracts at 31 December comprised: 2008 2007 m m Long-term business Participating contracts 65,278 53,609 Non-participating contracts at fair value 39,509 43,608 Non-participating contracts at amortised cost 2,772 1,027 42,281 44,635 Total 107,559 98,244 b Long-term business investment liabilities Investment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer, and are therefore treated as financial instruments under IFRS.
Many investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology and Group practice for long-term business liabilities as described in note 38.
They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS.
In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall.
The IASB has deferred consideration of participating contracts to Phase II of its insurance contracts project.
For participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified as a liability, referred to as unallocated distributable surplus.
Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 40.
Investment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
Most non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value are unit-linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the unit reserve plus additional non-unit reserves if required on a fair value basis.
For this business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term.
The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 26 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 49.
Aviva plc 224 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 39 Liability for investment contracts continued In the United States, funding agreements consist of one to ten year fixed rate contracts.
These contracts may not be cancelled by the holders unless there is a default under the agreement, but may be terminated by Aviva at any time.
The weighted average interest rates for fixed-rate and floating-rate funding agreements in 2008 were 4.89% and 2.58% 2007: 5.21% and 5.15% respectively.
The funding agreements issued before 2008 are measured at fair value equal to the present value of contractual cash flows, and for new business in 2008 are measured at amortised cost.
Most funding agreements are fully collateralised and therefore their fair values are not adjusted for own credit risk.
There is a small volume of annuity certain business for which the liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The fair value of contract liabilities measured at amortised cost is not materially different from the amortised cost liability.
c Movements in the year The following movements have occurred in the year: i Participating investment contracts 2008 2007 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 53,609 49,400 Provisions in respect of new business 3,391 3,009 Expected change in existing business provisions 1,909 1,978 Variance between actual and expected experience 4,661 404 Impact of operating assumption changes 166 3 Impact of economic assumption changes 244 178 Effect of special bonus to with-profit policyholders note 43b 399 Other movements 13 176 Change in liability recognised as an expense 3,088 1,025 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 2,181 Foreign exchange rate movements 12,576 3,184 Carrying amount at 31 December 65,278 53,609 The effect of changes in main assumptions is given in note 42. ii Non-participating investment contracts 2008 2007 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 44,635 38,958 Provisions in respect of new business 5,314 8,575 Expected change in existing business provisions 2,273 1,094 Variance between actual and expected experience 9,503 3,231 Impact of operating assumption changes 28 2 Impact of economic assumption changes 5 20 Other movements 169 61 Change in liability 6,654 4,329 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 14 254 Foreign exchange rate movements 4,314 1,094 Carrying amount at 31 December 42,281 44,635 The negative variance between actual and expected experience relates mainly to lower than expected investment returns on unit funds.

Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 225 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 40 Financial guarantees and options This note details the financial guarantees and options we have given for some of our insurance and investment products.
As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including investment return guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Further information on assumptions is given in notes 38 and 39. a UK Life with-profit business In the UK, life insurers are required to comply with the FSAs realistic reporting regime for their with-profit funds for the calculation of FSA liabilities.
Under the FSAs rules, provision for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities must be measured at fair value, using market-consistent stochastic models.
A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions.
The material guarantees and options to which this provision relates are: i Maturity value guarantees Substantially all of the conventional with-profit business and a significant proportion of unitised with-profit business have minimum maturity values reflecting the sums assured plus declared annual bonus.
In addition, the guarantee fund has offered maturity value guarantees on certain unit-linked products.
For some unitised with-profit life contracts the amount paid after the fifth policy anniversary is guaranteed to be at least as high as the premium paid increased in line with the rise in RPI CPI.
ii No market valuation reduction MVR guarantees For unitised business, there are a number of circumstances where a no MVR guarantee is applied, for example on certain policy anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value of units and the market value of the underlying assets.
iii Guaranteed annuity options The Groups UK with-profit funds have written individual and group pension contracts which contain guaranteed annuity rate options GAOs, where the policyholder has the option to take the benefits from a policy in the form of an annuity based on guaranteed conversion rates.
The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities.
iv Guaranteed minimum pension The Groups UK with-profit funds also have certain policies that contain a guaranteed minimum level of pensions as part of the condition of the original transfer from state benefits to the policy.
In addition, while these do not constitute guarantees, the with-profit fund companies have made promises to certain policyholders in relation to their with-profit mortgage endowments.
Subject to certain conditions, top-up payments will be made on these policies at maturity to meet the mortgage value up to a maximum of the 31 December 1999 illustrated shortfall.
b UK Life non-profit business The Groups UK non-profit funds are evaluated by reference to statutory reserving rules, including changes introduced in 2006 under FSA Policy Statement 06 14 Prudential Changes for Insurers.
i Guaranteed annuity options Similar options to those written in the with-profit fund have been written in relation to non-profit products.
Provision for these guarantees does not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to 27 million at 31 December 2008 2007: 36 million.
ii Guaranteed unit price on certain products Certain unit-linked pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benefits at retirement or death.
No additional provision is made for this guarantee as the investment management strategy for these funds is designed to ensure that the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and interest rates.
c Overseas life businesses In addition to guarantees written in the Groups UK life businesses, our overseas businesses have also written contracts containing guarantees and options.
Details of the significant guarantees and options provided by overseas life businesses are set out below.
Aviva plc 226 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 40 Financial guarantees and options continued i France Guaranteed surrender value and guaranteed minimum bonuses Aviva France has written a number of contracts with such guarantees.
The guaranteed surrender value is the accumulated value of the contract including accrued bonuses.
Bonuses are based on accounting income from amortised bond portfolios, where the duration of bond portfolios is set in relation to the expected duration of the policies, plus income and releases from realised gains on equity-type investments.
Policy reserves are equal to guaranteed surrender values.
Local statutory accounting envisages the establishment of a reserve, Provision pour Alas Financiers PAF, when accounting income is less than 125% of guaranteed minimum credited returns.
No PAF was established at the end of 2008.
The most significant of these contracts is the AFER Eurofund which has total liabilities of 33 billion at 31 December 2008 2007: 24 billion.
The guaranteed bonus on this contract equals 75% of the average of the last two years declared bonus rates and was 3.66% for 2008 2007: 3.64% compared with an accounting income from the fund of 4.85% 2007: 4.92%.
Non-AFER contracts with guaranteed surrender values had liabilities of 12 billion 2007: 8 billion at 31 December 2008 and all guaranteed annual bonus rates are between 0% and 4.5%.
For non-AFER business, the accounting income return exceeded guaranteed bonus rates in 2008.
Guaranteed death and maturity benefits In France, the Group has also sold unit-linked policies where the death and or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal to the premiums paid.
The reserve held in the Groups consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2008 for this guarantee is 113 million 2007: 30 million.
The reserve is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of the economic liability.
At the end of 2008, total sums at risk for these contracts were 1,279 million 2007: 63 million out of total unit-linked funds of 14 billion 2007: 15 billion.
The average age of policyholders was approximately 53.
It is estimated that this liability would increase by 59 million 2007: 17 million if yields were to decrease by 1% per annum and by 22 million 2007: 7 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2008 levels.
These figures do not reflect our ability to review the tariff for this option.
ii Netherlands Guaranteed minimum return at maturity In the Netherlands, it is market practice to guarantee a minimum return at maturity on traditional savings and pension contracts.
Guarantees on older lines of business are 4% per annum while, for business written since 1 September 1999, the guarantee is 3% per annum.
On Group pensions business, it is often possible to recapture guarantee costs through adjustments to surrender values or to premium rates.
On transition to IFRS, Delta Lloyd changed the reserving basis for most traditional contracts to reflect current market interest rates, for consistency with the reporting of assets at market value.
The cost of meeting interest rate guarantees is allowed for directly in the liabilities.
Although most traditional contracts are valued at market interest rate, the split by level of guarantee shown below is according to the original underlying guarantee.
The total liabilities for traditional business at 31 December 2008 are 14 billion 2007: 10 billion analysed as follows: Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities 3% guarantee 3% guarantee 4% guarantee 4% guarantee 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m Individual 2,214 1,387 4,684 3,671 Group pensions 689 485 6,804 3,993 Total 2,903 1,872 11,488 7,664 Delta Lloyd has certain unit-linked contracts which provide a guaranteed minimum return at maturity from 4% pa to 2% pa.
Provisions consist of unit values plus an additional reserve for the guarantee.
The additional provision for the guarantee was 226 million 2007: 70 million.
An additional provision of 121 million 2007: 19 million in respect of investment return guarantees on group segregated fund business is held.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 255 million 2007: 211 million if yields were to reduce by 1% pa and by 56 million 2007: 21 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2008 levels.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 227 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 40 Financial guarantees and options continued iii Ireland Guaranteed annuity options Products with similar GAOs to those offered in the UK have been issued in Ireland.
The current net of reinsurance provision for such options is 180 million 2007: 160 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis, making conservative assumptions for the factors which influence the cost of the guarantee, principally annuitant mortality option take-up and long-term interest rates.
These GAOs are in the money at current interest rates but the exposure to interest rates under these contracts has been hedged through the use of reinsurance, using derivatives swaptions.
The swaptions effectively guarantee that an interest rate of 5% will be available at the vesting date of these benefits so there is reduced exposure to a further decrease in interest rates.
No MVR guarantees Certain unitised with-profit policies containing no MVR guarantees, similar to those in the UK, have been sold in Ireland.
These guarantees are currently in-the-money by 16 million 2007:out-of-the-money by 53 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis as the excess of the current policy surrender value over the discounted value excluding terminal bonus of the guarantees.
The value of these guarantees is usually sensitive to the performance of investments held in the with-profit fund.
Amounts payable under these guarantees are determined by the bonuses declared on these policies.
It is estimated that the guarantees would be in-themoney by 16 million 2007: out-of-the-money by 46 million if yields were to increase by 1% per annum and by 16 million 2007: out-of-the-money by 29 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2008 levels.
There is no sensitivity to either interest rates or equity markets since there is no longer any exposure to equity in these funds and a matching strategy has been implemented for bonds.
Return of premium guarantee Until 2005, Hibernian Life wrote two tranches of linked bonds with a return of premium guarantee, or a price floor guarantee, after five or six years.
The provision for these over and above unit and sterling reserves, at the end of 2008 is 18 million 2007: 0.1 million.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 4 million 2007: 1 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from the year end 2008 levels.
However, the provision increase would be broadly off-set by an increase in the value of the hedging assets that were set up on sale of these policies.
We would not expect any significant impact on this provision as a result of interest rate movements.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 2 million if property values were to decline by 10% from year end 2008 levels.
This would be offset by an increase in the value of the hedging assets by 1 million, the difference reflecting the fact that only the second tranche was hedged for property exposure.
iv Spain and Italy Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values The Group has also written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in both Spain and Italy.
Traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 6% in Spain and 4% in Italy on existing business, while on new business the maximum guaranteed rate is lower.
Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations.
At 31 December 2008, total liabilities for the Spanish business were 5 billion 2007: 4 billion with a further reserve of 19 million 2007: 16 million for guarantees.
Total liabilities for the Italian business were 5 billion 2007:4 billion, with a further provision of 55 million 2007: 48 million for guarantees.
Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates.
It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to increase by 59 million 2007: 66 million in Spain and 5 million 2007: 14 million in Italy if interest rates fell by 1% from end 2008 values.
Under this sensitivity test, the guarantee provision in Spain is calculated conservatively, assuming a long-term market interest rate of 1.6% and no lapses or premium discontinuances.
v United States Indexed and total return strategy products In the United States, the Group writes indexed life and deferred annuity products.
These products guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on certain indices, primarily the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Stock Price Index.
A portion of each premium is used to purchase derivatives to hedge the growth in interest credited to the policyholder.
The derivatives held by the Group and the options embedded in the policy are both carried at fair value.
The US Treasury swap curve plus a risk adjustment of 5.30% 2007: 1.05% is used as the discount rate to calculate the fair value of the embedded options.
Aviva plc 228 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 40 Financial guarantees and options continued The risk adjustment calculation is based on market spreads on senior long-term unsecured Aviva plc debt with a reduction to reflect policyholder priority over other creditors in case of default.
The amount of change in the fair value of these embedded options resulting from the risk adjustment in 2008 is 514 million, and is principally attributable to market factors rather than instrument specific credit risk.
There were no significant gains or losses attributable to the risk adjustment or instrument specific credit risk for these embedded options in 2007.
At 31 December 2008, the total liabilities for indexed products were 15 billion 2007: 8 billion, including liabilities for the embedded option of 1.9 billion 2007: 1.2 billion.
If interest rates were to increase by 1%, the provision for embedded options would decrease by 138 million 2007: 89 million and, if interest rates were to decrease by 1%, the provision would increase by 155 million 2007: 86 million.
The Group has certain products that credit interest based on a total return strategy, whereby policyholders are allowed to allocate their premium payments to different asset classes within the general account.
The Group guarantees a minimum return of premium plus approximately 3% interest over the term of the contracts.
The linked general account assets are fixed maturity securities, and both the securities and the contract liabilities are carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2008, the liabilities for total return strategy products were 1.5 billion 2007: 1.2 billion.
The Group offers an optional lifetime guaranteed income benefit focused on the retirement income segment of the deferred annuity marketplace to help customers manage income during both the accumulation stage and the distribution stage of their financial life.
At 31 December 2008, a total of 3.2 billion 2007: 0.7 billion in indexed deferred annuities have elected this benefit taking steps to guarantee retirement income.
d Sensitivity In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, real estate prices and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on guaranteed annuity options GAOs, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level.
Other guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made.
41 Reinsurance assets This note details the reinsurance recoverables on our insurance and investment contract liabilities.
a Carrying amounts The reinsurance assets at 31 December comprised: Restated 2008 2007 m m Long-term business Insurance contracts 4,466 4,298 Participating investment contracts 52 22 Non-participating investment contracts 1,047 1,461 Outstanding claims provisions 145 94 5,710 5,875 General insurance and health Outstanding claims provisions 1,737 1,634 Provisions for claims incurred but not reported 29 29 1,766 1,663 Provision for unearned premiums 418 511 Other technical provisions 5 2,184 2,179 Total 7,894 8,054 Of the above total, 6,097 million 2007: 4,796 million is expected to be recovered more than one year after the balance sheet date.

This note analyses the effect of the changes.
This disclosure only allows for the impact on liabilities and related assets, such as reinsurance, deferred acquisition costs and AVIF, and does not allow for offsetting movements in the value of backing financial assets.
Effect on Effect on profit profit 2008 2007 m m Assumptions Long-term insurance business Interest rates 521 850 Expenses 24 13 Persistency rates 2 2 Mortality for assurance contracts 44 16 Mortality for annuity contracts 26 11 Tax and other assumptions 93 60 Investment contracts Interest rates 75 12 Expenses 27 5 Persistency rates 2 Tax and other assumptions 36 7 General insurance and health business Change in loss ratio assumptions 1 Change in discount rate assumptions 94 3 Change in expense ratio assumptions 4 Total 491 945 The impact of interest rates for long-term business relates primarily to the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands, driven by the market level of risk-free rates.
Lower valuation interest rates in 2008 had the effect of increasing liabilities for traditional business and hence a negative impact on profit.
This follows an increase in market interest rates in 2007 which had the reverse effect.
The overall impact on profit also depends on movements in the value of assets backing the liabilities, which is not included in this disclosure.
Favourable impacts from expense and mortality assumption changes for insurance contracts relate mainly to the UK.
Other assumption changes include further implementation of FSA Policy Statement PS06 14 for non-profit business and expense inflation adjustments in the UK, and reserve releases in Asia, partly offset by compensation for unit-linked policies in the Netherlands.

In each case the negative balance is considered to be recoverable from margins in the existing participating business liabilities.
b Special bonus declared by UK Life business On 5 February 2008, the Groups UK long-term business operation, Norwich Union Life, announced a one-off, special bonus worth an estimated 2.3 billion, benefiting around 1.1 million with-profit policyholders in its CGNU Life and CULAC with-profit funds.
The bonus is being used to enhance policy values by around 10% in total, in three instalments, with the qualifying dates being 1 January 2008, 1 January 2009 and 1 January 2010.
In accordance with the way the funds are managed, the bonus distribution is being split on a 90 10 basis between policyholders and shareholders.
Over the three years, policyholders will receive a total currently estimated as 2,127 million and shareholders will receive a total currently estimated as 236 million.
As explained in accounting policies F and K, the Groups insurance and participating investment contract liabilities are measured in accordance with IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and FRS 27, Life Assurance.
The latter requires liabilities for with-profit funds falling within the scope of the UKs Financial Services Authoritys capital regime to be determined in accordance with this regime, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
This required us to recognise planned discretionary bonuses within policyholder liabilities at 31 December 2007, even if there was no constructive obligation at the time.
As a result of the announcement made above, a transfer of 2,127 million was made in 2007 from the UDS in order to increase insurance liabilities by 1,728 million note 38 b and participating investment contract liabilities by 399 million note 39 c. Of the 236 million due to shareholders, 89 million has been transferred from the UDS in 2008 2007: nil.

In countries where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future profits will be available.
Where this is the case the directors have relied on business plans supporting future profits.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences of 2,961 million 2007: 1,805 million to carry forward against future taxable income of the necessary category in the companies concerned.
Of these, trading losses of 279 million will expire in the next 5-15 years.
The remaining losses have no expiry date.
In addition, the Group has an unrecognised capital loss of 556 million 2007: 409 million.
This tax loss can be offset against future capital gains and has no expiry date.
Deferred tax liabilities of 912 million 2007: 666 million have not been established for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures and associates including tax payable on remittance of overseas retained earnings because the Group can control the timing of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Such unremitted earnings totalled 6,121 million at 31 December 2008 2007: 4,258 million.

46 Pension obligations This note describes the Groups pension arrangements for its employees and explains how our obligations to these schemes are calculated.
a Introduction The Group operates a large number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world.
The only material defined benefit schemes are in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland and, of these, the main UK scheme is by far the largest.
The assets of the main UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
In the Netherlands, the main scheme is held in a separate foundation which invests in the life funds of the Group.
In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation, and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of each of the defined benefit schemes is carried out at least every three years for the benefit of scheme trustees and members.
Actuarial reports have been submitted for each scheme within this period, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.
b Membership The number of scheme members at 31 December 2008 was as follows: United Kingdom Netherlands Canada Ireland 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Number Number Number Number Number Number Number Number Active members 9,972 10,532 4,920 5,048 889 960 1,180 1,157 Deferred members 53,376 53,953 5,739 5,015 529 617 842 830 Pensioners 27,749 27,176 3,014 2,815 1,280 1,350 682 674 Total members 91,097 91,661 13,673 12,878 2,698 2,927 2,704 2,661 Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 235 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 46 Pension obligations continued c Main UK scheme In the UK, the Group operates two main pension schemes, the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme ASPS and the smaller RAC 2003 Pension Scheme.
New entrants join the defined contribution section of the ASPS, as the defined benefit section is closed to new employees.
This scheme is operated by a trustee company, with 11 trustee directors, comprising representatives of the employers, staff, pensioners and an independent trustee referred to below as the trustees.
i Defined benefit section of the ASPS The Company works closely with the trustees who are required to consult it on the funding of the scheme and its investment strategy.
Following each actuarial valuation, the Company and the trustees agree the level of contributions needed.
At 31 March 2006, the date of the last actuarial valuation, this section of the scheme had an excess of obligations over available assets, on a funding basis, of 1,019 million.
The Company has agreed with the trustees a funding plan through to March 2014, over which it will aim to eliminate the funding deficit.
Funding levels are monitored on an annual basis.
The employing companies contributions to the defined benefit section of the ASPS throughout 2008 were 39% of employees pensionable salaries, together with the cost of redundancies during the year, and additional deficit funding payments totalling 369 million.
As this section of the scheme is closed to new entrants and the contribution rate is determined using the projected unit credit method, it is expected that the percentage cost of providing future service benefits will continue to increase as the membership ages, leading to higher pension costs, and the number of members falls, leading to a higher charge per member.
The employers contribution rate for 2009 has therefore been increased to 41% of pensionable salaries expected to be 147 million, pending finalisation of the March 2009 valuation.
Active members of this section of the ASPS contribute 5% of their pensionable salaries, increasing to either 6% or 7.5% from 1 July 2009.
In 2006, the Groups UK life business carried out an investigation into the allocation of costs in respect of funding the ASPS, to identify the deficit that arose in respect of accruals prior to the introduction of the current management services agreements MSAs and to propose a split between individual product companies based on an allocation of the deficit into preand post-MSA amounts.
The results of this review were agreed by the relevant company boards and accepted by the UK regulator.
Consequently, with effect from 1 January 2006, the Companys UK with-profit product companies are liable for a share, currently 12%, of the additional payments for deficit funding referred to above.
This has resulted in movements between the unallocated divisible surplus UDS and retained earnings via the statement of recognised income of 78 million in 2008 2007: 61 million to reflect actuarial movements in the deficit during the year and therefore a change in the amount recoverable from the with-profit product companies.
ii Defined contribution money purchase section of the ASPS The trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for monitoring the performance of the available investment funds.
Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their attitude to risk and their retirement plans.
The employers contribution rates for members of the defined contribution section throughout 2008 were 8% of pensionable salaries, together with further contributions up to 4% where members contribute, and the cost of the death-in-service benefits.
These contribution rates are unchanged for 2009. d Charges to the income statement The total pension costs of the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution schemes were: 2008 2007 m m UK defined benefit schemes 115 137 Overseas defined benefit schemes 60 54 Total defined benefit schemes note 10b 175 191 UK defined contribution schemes 39 44 Overseas defined contribution schemes 19 19 Total defined contribution schemes note 10b 58 63 233 254 There were no significant contributions outstanding or prepaid as at either 31 December 2008 or 2007.
Aviva plc 236 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 46 Pension obligations continued e IAS 19 disclosures Disclosures under IAS 19 for the material defined benefit schemes in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland are given below.
Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to defined contribution pensions.
Total employer contributions for these schemes in 2009 are expected to be 241 million.
i Assumptions on scheme liabilities The projected unit credit method The inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis.
This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance for their projected future earnings.
It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the pension obligations.
Alternative measurement methods There are alternative methods of measuring liabilities, for example by calculating an accumulated benefit obligation the present value of benefits for service already rendered but with no allowance for future salary increases or on a solvency basis, using the cost of securing the benefits at a particular date with an insurance company or one of the growing market of alternative buy-out providers.
This could take the form of a buy-out, in which the entire liability will be settled in one payment with all obligations transferred to an insurance company or buy-out provider, or a buy-in, in which annuities or other insurance products are purchased to cover a part or all of the liability.
A valuation of the liabilities in either of these cases will almost always result in a higher estimate of the pension deficit than under an ongoing approach, as they assume that the sponsor immediately transfers the majority, if not all, of the risk to another provider who would be seeking to make a profit on the transaction.
However, there are only a limited number of organisations that would be able to offer these options for schemes of the size of those in our Group.
The full buy-out cost would only be known if quotes were obtained from such organisations but, to illustrate the cost of a buy-out valuation, an estimate for the main UK scheme is that the year end liabilities of 6.8 billion could be valued some 3.7 billion higher, at 10.5 billion.
There is a small buy-out market in Ireland, largely restricted to pensions currently in payment and it is not clear whether current capacity would enable an immediate buy-out of our Irish pension liabilities at present.
The Canadian defined benefit plans liabilities represent the likely limit on what the Canadian group annuity market could absorb at normal competitive group annuity prices if the entire plan were subject to a buy-out valuation.
There is in fact a reasonably high chance that only a portion of the plans liabilities could be absorbed in one tranche.
IAS 19 requires us to use the projected unit credit method to measure our pension scheme liabilities.
Neither of the alternative methods is considered appropriate in presenting fairly the Groups obligations to the members of its pension schemes on an ongoing basis, so they are not considered further.
Valuations and assumptions The valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent full actuarial valuations, updated to take account of that standards requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2008.
The updating was made by actuaries in each country who were independent of the Group.
Scheme assets are stated at their fair values at 31 December 2008.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 237 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 46 Pension obligations continued The main actuarial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19 are: UK Netherlands Canada Ireland 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Inflation rate 2.9% 3.4% 2.0% 2.0% 2.5% 2.5% 2.0% 2.5% General salary increases 4.7% 5.2% 3.0% 3.0% 3.75% 3.75% 3.75% 4.25% Pension increases 3.1% 3.4% 2.0% 1.3% 2.0% 2.4% 1.25% 1.25% 2.0% 2.4% Deferred pension increases 3.1% 3.4% 2.0% 1.3% 2.0 %2.4% 2.0% 2.4% Discount rate 6.2% 5.8% 5.7% 5.5% 6.75% 5.25% 5.9% 5.6% Basis of AA-rated AA-rated AA-rated AA-rated discount corporate bonds corporate bonds corporate bonds corporate bonds rate Age-related scale increases plus 3% 2007: 3%.
The discount rate and pension increase rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate.
For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of high quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.
A 1% increase in this rate and therefore the net discount rate would reduce the liabilities by 1.4 billion and the service cost for the year by 24 million.
Mortality assumptions Mortality assumptions are significant in measuring the Groups obligations under its defined benefit schemes, particularly given the maturity of these obligations in the material schemes.
The assumptions used are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of these schemes.
The mortality tables, average life expectancy and pension duration used at 31 December 2008 for scheme members are as follows: Life expectancy pension Life expectancy pension duration at NRA of a male duration at NRA of a female Normal 20 years 20 years retirement Currently younger than Currently younger than Mortality table age NRA aged NRA NRA aged NRA NRA UK PA92U2009MC with a one year age 92.2 91.7 93.8 89.3 rating deduction and including an allowance for future improvements 60 29.3 32.2 31.7 33.8 Netherlands 83.3 84.9 86.1 86.8 CRC8b, which includes allowance for future improvements up to 2050 65 18.3 19.9 21.1 21.8 Canada 84.0 84.0 86.6 86.6 UP1994 projected to 2015, using Scale AA 65 19.0 19.0 21.6 21.6 Ireland PA92C2020 current pensioners 84.4 85.7 87.4 88.7 2040 future pensioners with allowance for future improvements 65 19.4 20.7 22.4 23.7 The assumptions above are based on commonly-used mortality tables.
In the UK, the standard mortality tables have been adjusted to reflect recent research into mortality experience.
However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption.
In the UK schemes, which are by far the most material to the Group, the assumptions include an allowance for future mortality improvement, based on the actuarial professions medium cohort projection table and incorporating underpins to the rate of future improvement equal to 1.5% p. a. for males and 1.0% p. a. for females.
The effect of assuming all members were one year younger would increase the above schemes liabilities by 180 million and the service cost for the year by 18 million.
The scheme liabilities have an average duration of between 20 and 23 years in the UK schemes and between 12 and 17 years in the overseas schemes.
Aviva plc 238 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 46 Pension obligations continued ii Assumptions on scheme assets The expected rates of return on the schemes assets are: UK Netherlands Canada Ireland 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Equities 6.3% 9.2% 6.0% 7.2% 4.5% 7.7% 6.0% 8.3% Bonds 5.2% 5.3% 3.8% 4.6% 4.3% 4.5% 4.1% 4.5% Property 4.8% 7.7% 5.7% 5.8% n a n a 4.5% 6.8% Cash 3.2% 5.8% 3.8% 4.6% n a n a 3.0% 2.3% The overall rates of return are based on the expected returns within each asset category and on current asset allocations.
The expected returns for equities and properties have been aligned with the rates used for the longer-term investment return assumptions, other than in the Netherlands, where they have been developed in conjunction with external advisers due to the characteristics of the scheme.
The figures for the total expected return on scheme assets in the following section are stated after deducting investment expenses.
iii Investments in Group-managed funds and insurance policies Plan assets in the UK and Dutch schemes include investments in Group-managed funds and insurance policies with other Group companies.
Their treatment in the relevant parts of the financial statements is as follows: Plan assets The treatment of these funds and policies in the consolidated balance sheet is described in section vii below.
Expected rates of return Where the relevant insurance policies are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, their expected rates of return are included in the appropriate line in the table in section ii above.
Pension expense To avoid double-counting of investment income on scheme assets and the assets backing the underlying policies, adjustments have been made to the former in the tables in section iv below.
iv Pension expense As noted above, plan assets in the UK and Dutch schemes include insurance policies with other Group companies.
To avoid double-counting of investment income on scheme assets and the assets backing the underlying policies, adjustments have been made to the former in the current year as shown in the tables below.

To meet these objectives, each schemes assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of equity and debt securities.
These reflect the current long-term asset allocation ranges chosen, having regard to the structure of liabilities within the schemes.
Main UK scheme Both the Group and the trustees regularly review the asset liability management of the main UK scheme.
It is fully understood that, whilst the current asset mix is designed to produce appropriate long-term returns, this introduces a material risk of volatility in the schemes surplus or deficit of assets compared with its liabilities.
The principal asset risks to which the scheme is exposed are: Equity market risk the effect of equity market falls on the value of plan assets.
Inflation risk the effect of inflation rising faster than expected on the value of the plan liabilities.
Aviva plc 240 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 46 Pension obligations continued Interest rate risk falling interest rates leading to an increase in liabilities significantly exceeding the increase in the value of assets.
There is also an exposure to currency risk where assets are not denominated in the same currency as the liabilities.
The majority of this exposure has been removed by the use of hedging instruments.
During 2008, there has been a reduction in the proportion of assets invested in equities, thereby mitigating the equity risk.
In addition, the trustees have taken measures to partially mitigate inflation and interest rate risks, including entering into inflation and interest rate swaps.
Other schemes The other schemes are considerably less material but their risks are managed in a similar way to those in the main UK scheme.
Plan assets in the table above include investments in Group-managed funds in the consolidated balance sheet of 99 million 2007: 150 million in the UK scheme, and insurance policies of 150 million and 1,402 million 2007: 143 million and 1,025 million in the UK and Dutch schemes respectively.
Where the investment and insurance policies are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, they are included in the appropriate line in the table above, otherwise they appear in Other.
The Dutch insurance policies are considered nontransferable under the terms of IAS 19 and so have been treated as other obligations to staff pension schemes within provisions see note 45.

They rank below its senior obligations and ahead of its preference shares and ordinary share capital.
The dated subordinated notes rank ahead of the undated subordinated notes.
The fair value of these notes at 31 December 2008 was 2,979 million 2007: 3,006 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices.
ii Debenture loans The 9.5% guaranteed bonds were issued by the Company at a discount of 1.1 million.
This discount and the issue expenses are being amortised over the full term of the bonds.
Although these bonds were issued in sterling, the loans have effectively been converted into euro liabilities through the use of financial instruments in a subsidiary.
The 2.5% perpetual subordinated loan notes were issued by a Dutch subsidiary to finance the acquisition of NUTS OHRA Beheer BV in 1999.
They are convertible into ordinary shares in Delta Lloyd NV, should there be a public offering of those shares.
These loan notes have a face value of 489.9 million but, because they are considered to be perpetual, their carrying value is 172.4 million, calculated in 1999 and based on the future cash flows in perpetuity discounted back at a market rate of interest.
The rate of interest paid on the notes is being gradually increased to a maximum of 2.76% in 2009.
Other loans comprise borrowings in the United States.
All these borrowings are at fixed rates and their fair value at 31 December 2008 was 663 million 2007: 395 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices or discounted future cash flows as appropriate.
iii Commercial paper The commercial paper consists of 535 million in the Company 2007: 918 million and 5 million in France 2007: 4 million.
All of this is considered core structural funding.
All commercial paper is repayable within one year and is issued in a number of different currencies, primarily sterling, euros and US dollars.
Its fair value is considered to be the same as its carrying value.

The PLPs have raised external debt, secured on their respective property portfolios, and the lenders are only entitled to obtain payment of both interest and principal to the extent there are sufficient resources in the respective PLPs.
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the policyholder or shareholders funds of any companies in the Aviva Group.
Loans of 978 million 2007: 485 million included in the table relate to those PLPs which have been consolidated as subsidiaries.
b Certain Irish policyholder investment funds and unit trusts, which have been fully consolidated in accordance with accounting policy D, have raised borrowings with external credit institutions.
The borrowings are secured on the funds, with the only recourse on default being the underlying investments in these funds and unit trusts.
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the shareholders funds of any companies in the Aviva Group.
These loans run for a period of five years, with interest rates fixed monthly and based on a fixed margin above the euro inter-bank rate.
The amount of these loans can be varied without any penalty being charged, subject to a maximum of 50% Loan to Value and a maximum facility of 72 million.
c During the year, a UK long term business has entered into a financial reassurance agreement with Swiss Re under which up front payments are received from Swiss Re in return for 90% of future surplus arising.
The loan will be repaid as profits emerge on the business.
v Securitised mortgage loan notes Loan notes have been issued by special purpose securitisation companies in the UK and the Netherlands.

a Uncertainty over claims provisions Note 38 gives details of the estimation techniques used by the Group to determine the general business outstanding claims provisions and of the methodology and assumptions used in determining the long-term business provisions.
These approaches are designed to allow for the appropriate cost of future policy-related liabilities, with a degree of prudence, to give a result within the normal range of outcomes.
To the extent that the ultimate cost falls outside this range, for example where experience is worse than that assumed, or future general business claims inflation differs from that expected, there is uncertainty in respect of these liabilities.
b Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards In the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation arising therefrom, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards.
Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in various jurisdictions, including Europe, Canada and Australia.
Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential number of incidents which they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability and the availability of reinsurance, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty.
However, on the basis of current information having regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims, and the strengthening of latent claims that took place during 2008, the directors consider that any additional costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
c Guarantees on long-term savings products As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including interest rate guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Note 40 gives details of these guarantees and options.
In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, property values and equity prices.
The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions for such guarantees and options are sufficient.
d Pensions mis-selling The pensions review of past sales of personal pension policies which involved transfers, opt outs and non-joiners from occupational schemes, as required by the Financial Services Authority FSA, has largely been completed.
A provision of some 18 million at 31 December 2008 2007: 23 million remains to meet the outstanding costs of the very few remaining cases, the anticipated cost of any guarantees provided, and potential levies payable to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups ability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
e Endowment reviews In December 1999, the FSA announced the findings of its review of mortgage endowments and expressed concern as to whether, given decreases in expected future investment returns, such policies could be expected to cover full repayment of mortgages.
A key conclusion was that, on average, holders of mortgage endowments had enjoyed returns such that they had fared at least as well as they would have done without an endowment.
Nevertheless, following the FSA review, all of the Groups UK mortgage endowment policyholders received policy-specific letters advising them whether their investment was on track to cover their mortgage.
In May 2002, in accordance with FSA requirements, the Group commenced sending out the second phase of endowment policy update letters, which provide policyholders with information about the performance of their policies and advice as to whether these show a projected shortfall at maturity.
The Group will send these updates annually to all mortgage endowment holders, in accordance with FSA requirements.
The Group has made provisions totalling 38 million at 31 December 2008 2007: 96 million to meet potential mis-selling costs and the associated expenses of investigating complaints.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups liability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 251 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 50 Contingent liabilities and other risk factors continued In August 2004, the Group confirmed its intention to introduce time barring on mortgage endowment complaints, under FSA rules.
The Group now includes details of its endowment policyholders time bar position within the annual re-projection mailings.
Customers will be given at least 12 months individual notice before a time bar becomes applicable double the six months notice required by the FSA.
f Regulatory compliance The Groups insurance and investment business is subject to local regulation in each of the countries in which it operates.
The FSA regulates the Groups UK business and in addition monitors the financial resources and organisation of the Group as a whole.
The FSA has broad powers including the authority to grant, vary the terms of, or cancel a regulated firms authorisation, to investigate marketing and sales practices and to require the maintenance of adequate financial resources.
The Groups regulators outside the UK typically have similar powers but in some cases they operate a system of prior product approval and hence place less emphasis than the FSA on regulating sales and marketing practices.
The directors believe each of the Groups regulated businesses dedicates appropriate resources to its compliance programme, endeavours to respond to regulatory enquiries in a constructive way, and takes corrective action when warranted.
However, all regulated financial services companies face the risk that their regulator could find that they have failed to comply with applicable regulations or have not undertaken corrective action as required.
The impact of any such finding whether in the UK or overseas could have a negative impact on the Groups reported results or on its relations with current and potential customers.
Regulatory action against a member of the Group could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the Group, or could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Group, its results of operations and or financial condition and divert managements attention from the day-to-day management of the business.
g Aviva USA litigation In November 2006, the Group completed the acquisition of the AmerUs Group, a US-based insurer.
In common with other companies operating in the sector, AmerUs is subject to litigation, including class-action litigation, arising out of its sale of equity-based index-linked annuity products.
The Group is aware of a multi-district class action filed against AmerUs in Pennsylvania but is not aware of any adverse development.
The directors continue to monitor the situation and consider that the litigation will not have a material effect on the Groups ability to meet shareholder expectations.
h Other In the course of conducting insurance and investment business, various Group companies receive liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation.
In the opinion of the directors, adequate provisions have been established for such claims and no material loss will arise in this respect.
The Company and several of its subsidiaries have guaranteed the overdrafts and borrowings of certain other Group companies.
At 31 December 2008, the total exposure of the Group and Company is nil 2007: 7 million and 88 million 2007: 113 million respectively but, in the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees and indemnities.
In addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have been given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiaries and associates to parties outside the Aviva Group.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.
The Group's insurance subsidiaries pay contributions to levy schemes in several countries in which we operate, Given the economic environment, there is a heightened risk that the levy contributions will need to be increased to protect policyholders if an insurance company falls into financial difficulties.
The directors continue to monitor the situation but are not aware of any need to increase provisions at the balance sheet date.

53 Group capital structure The Group maintains an efficient capital structure from a combination of equity shareholders funds, preference capital, subordinated debt and borrowings, consistent with our overall risk profile and the regulatory and market requirements of our business.
This note describes the way we manage our capital and shows where this is employed.
a Capital management objectives Avivas capital management philosophy is focused on capital efficiency and effective risk management to support a progressive dividend policy and earnings per share growth.
Rigorous capital allocation is one of our primary strategic priorities and is ultimately governed by the Group Executive Committee.
Overall capital risk appetite is set and managed with reference to the requirements of a range of different stakeholders including shareholders, policyholders, regulators and rating agencies.
In managing capital we seek to: maintain sufficient, but not excessive, financial strength to support new business growth and satisfy the requirements of our regulators and other stakeholders, and thus give both our customers and shareholders assurance of our financial strength: optimise our overall debt to equity structure to enhance our returns to shareholders, subject to our capital risk appetite and balancing the requirements of the range of stakeholders: retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity, including significant unutilised committed credit lines and access to a range of capital markets: allocate capital rigorously across the Group, to drive value adding growth in accordance with risk appetite: and increase the dividend on a basis judged prudent, while retaining capital to support future business growth, using dividend cover on an IFRS operating earnings after tax basis in the 1.5 to 2.0 times range as a guide.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 255 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 53 Group capital structure continued b Capital resources The primary sources of capital used by the group are equity shareholders funds, preference shares, subordinated debt and borrowings.
We also consider and, where efficient to do so, utilise alternative sources of capital such as reinsurance and securitisation in addition to the more traditional sources of funding.
Targets are established in relation to regulatory solvency, ratings, liquidity and dividend capacity and are a key tool in managing capital in accordance with our risk appetite and the requirements of our various stakeholders.
In February, the Standard & Poors S&P rating committee downgraded NU Life from AA to AA-, which is now aligned with the other 'core' group subsidiaries.
At the same time S&P have changed the outlook on NU Life's ratings from negative to stable.
There are no changes to any of the group's other ratings or outlooks.
"The Group's financial strength rating from Moody's is Aa3 excellent with a stable outlook and A ""superior"" with a stable outlook from AM Best."
c Capital allocation Capital allocation is undertaken based on a rigorous analysis of a range of financial, strategic, risk and capital factors to ensure that capital is allocated efficiently to value adding business opportunities.
A clear management decision-making framework, incorporating ongoing operational and strategic performance review, periodic longer term strategic and financial planning and robust due diligence over capital allocation is in place, governed by the Group Executive Committee and Group Asset Committee.
These processes incorporate various capital profitability metrics, including an assessment of return on capital employed and internal rates of return in relation to hurdle rates to ensure capital is allocated efficiently and that excess business unit capital is repatriated where appropriate.
d Different measures of capital In recognition of the requirements of different stakeholders, we measure capital on a number of different bases, all of which are taken into account when managing and allocating capital across the group.
These include measures which comply with the regulatory regimes within which we operate and those which the directors consider appropriate for the management of the business.
The primary measures are: i Accounting bases We report our results on both an IFRS and a Market Consistent Embedded Value MCEV basis.
The directors consider that the MCEV principles provide a more meaningful measure of the long term underlying value of the capital employed in our life and related businesses.
This basis allows for the impact of uncertainty in the future investment returns more explicitly and is consistent with the way the life business is priced and managed.
Accordingly, in addition to IFRS, we analyse and measure the net asset value and total capital employed for the group on this basis.
This is the basis on which group return on equity is measured.
ii Regulatory bases Individual regulated subsidiaries measure and report solvency based on applicable local regulations, including in the UK the regulations established by the Financial Services Authority FSA.
These measures are also consolidated under the European Insurance Groups Directive IGD to calculate regulatory capital adequacy at an aggregate group level.
We fully complied with these regulatory requirements during the year.
iii Rating agency bases Agency ratings are an important indicator of financial strength and maintenance of these ratings is one of the key drivers of capital risk appetite.
Certain rating agencies have proprietary capital models which they use to assess available capital resources against capital requirements as a component of their overall criteria for assigning ratings.
In addition, rating agency measures and targets in respect of gearing and fixed charge cover are also important in evaluating the level of borrowings utilised by the group.
While not mandatory external requirements, in practice rating agency capital measures tend to act as one of the primary drivers of capital requirements, reflecting the capital strength required in relation to our target ratings.
iv Economic bases We also measure capital using an economic capital model that takes into account a more realistic set of financial and non-financial assumptions.
This model continues to be developed and is increasingly relevant in the internal management and external assessment of our capital resources.
The economic capital model is used to assess capital strength in accordance with the Individual Capital Assessment ICA requirements established by the FSA.
Further developments are planned to meet the emerging requirements of the Solvency II framework and other external agencies.
Aviva plc 256 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 53 Group capital structure continued Accounting basis and capital employed by segment The table below shows how our capital, on an MCEV basis, is deployed by segment and how that capital is funded.

The corporate net liabilities represent the element of the pension scheme deficit held centrally.
Minority interests have increased to 3,013 million 2007 restated: 2,501 million due to foreign exchange movement.
At 31 December 2008 we had 24.8 billion 2007: 29.1 billion of total capital employed in our trading operations, measured on an MCEV basis.
Total capital employed is financed by a combination of equity shareholders funds, preference capital, subordinated debt and borrowings.
In addition to our external funding sources, we have certain internal borrowing arrangements in place which allow some of the assets that support technical liabilities to be invested in a pool of central assets for use across the group.
These internal debt balances allow for the capital allocated to business operations to exceed the externally sourced capital resources of the group.
Although intra-group in nature, they are included as part of the capital base for the purpose of capital management.
These arrangements arise in relation to the following: Certain subsidiaries, subject to continuing to satisfy standalone capital and liquidity requirements, loan funds to corporate and holding entities, these loans satisfy arms length criteria and all interest payments are made when due.
Aviva International Insurance AII Ltd acts as both a UK general insurer and as the primary holding company for our foreign subsidiaries.
Internal capital management mechanisms in place allocate a portion of the total capital of the company to the UK general insurance operations.
These mechanisms also allow for some of the assets backing technical liabilities to be made available for use across the Group.
Balances in respect of these arrangements are also treated as internal debt for capital management purposes.
Net internal debt represents the balance of the above amounts due from corporate and holding entities, less the tangible net assets held by these entities.
On 13 May 2008 we issued 0.8 billion equivalent of Lower Tier 2 hybrid in a dual-tranche transaction 400 million and 500 million.
0.6 billion of the proceeds was used to repay short-term commercial paper borrowings.
On 8 August 2008 we issued a further 0.2 billion of lower tier 2 hybrid debt.
These transactions have a positive impact on group IGD solvency and economic capital measures.
Financial leverage, the ratio of external senior and subordinated debt to MCEV capital and reserves was 34.7% 2007: 19.2%.
Fixed charge cover, which measures the extent to which external interest costs, including subordinated debt interest and preference dividends, are covered by MCEV operating profit was 9.2 times 2007: 9.2 times.

The analysis of movements in capital provides an explanation of the movement in available capital of the Group's life business for the year.
This analysis is intended to give an understanding of the underlying causes of changes in the available capital of the Group's life business, and provides a distinction between some of the key factors affecting the available capital.
For the UK funds, equity performance has been very adverse.
Although hedging assets are in place against the impact of equity movement on guarantees the hedges are not perfect and until October there remained equity exposure in CGNU CULAC through the estate investment strategy.
Since October the exposure of the estate to equity in CGNU CULAC has been very much reduced and consists largely of indirect exposure through future profit from unit-linked business, or the value of annual management charges accruing to estate from the UWP explicit charge business.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 259 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 54 Capital statement continued Fixed interest yields have significantly reduced especially at short duration.
The movement is beneficial for CGNU CULAC where the rise in asset values of assets outside asset share is greater than the rise in guarantee costs, but adverse for NUL&P.
Credit spreads have moved materially particularly in the final quarter and this is adverse for all funds and the credit spread movement is unhedged.
Implied market volatility on equity has increased significantly in the final quarter, which increases the market consistent cost of guarantees and is unhedged.
The combined loss for CGNU CULAC is 115m, and for NUL&P 208 million.
Lapse rate assumptions have been changed for year end 2008 reporting to bring the assumptions more into line with experience.
The changes reduced the value of the estates in all funds.
For the Overseas life operations, the negative variance between actual and expected experience is driven mainly by the widening of credit spreads and other market movements, which has led to capital depreciation of fixed interest assets and consequential reduction of the unallocated divisible surplus in France and other European businesses.
In aggregate, the Group has at its disposal total available capital of 13.6 billion 2007: 16.8 billion, representing the aggregation of the solvency capital of all of our businesses.
This capital is available to meet risks and regulatory requirements set by reference to local guidance and EU directives.
After effecting the year end transfer to shareholders, the UK with-profit funds available capital of 2.7 billion 2007: 4.5 billion can only be used to provide support for UK with-profit business and is not available to cover other shareholder risks.
This is comfortably in excess of the required capital margin and, therefore, the shareholders are not required to provide further capital support to this business.
For the remaining life and general insurance operations, the total available capital amounting to 10.9 billion 2007: 12.3 billion is significantly higher than the minimum requirements established by regulators and, in principle, the excess is available to shareholders.
In practice, management will hold higher levels of capital within each business operation to provide appropriate cover for risk.
As the total available capital of 13.6 billion is arrived at on the basis of local regulatory guidance, which evaluates assets and liabilities prudently, it understates the economic capital of the business which is considerably higher.
This is a limitation of the Group Capital Statement which, to be more meaningful, needs to evaluate available capital on an economic basis and compare it with the risk capital required for each individual operation, after allowing for the considerable diversification benefits that exist in our Group.
Within the Aviva Group there exist intra-group arrangements to provide capital to particular business units.
Included in these arrangements is a subordinated loan of 200 million from NU Life Holdings Group to the NUL&P non-profit fund to provide capital to support the writing of new business.
The available capital of the Groups with-profit funds is determined in accordance with the Realistic balance sheet regime prescribed by the FSAs regulations, under which liabilities to policyholders include both declared bonuses and the constructive obligation for future bonuses not yet declared.
The available capital resources include an estimate of the value of their respective estates, included as part of the unallocated divisible surplus.
The estate represents the surplus in the fund that is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
It represents capital resources of the individual with-profit fund to which it relates and is available to meet regulatory and other solvency requirements of the fund and, in certain circumstances, additional liabilities may arise.
The liabilities included in the balance sheet for the with-profit funds do not include the amount representing the shareholders portion of future bonuses.
However, the shareholders portion is treated as a deduction from capital that is available to meet regulatory requirements and is therefore shown as a separate adjustment in the capital statement.
In accordance with the FSAs regulatory rules under its realistic capital regime, the Group is required to hold sufficient capital in its UK life with-profit funds to meet the FSA capital requirements, based on the risk capital margin RCM.
The determination of the RCM depends on various actuarial and other assumptions about potential changes in market prices, and the actions management would take in the event of particular adverse changes in market conditions.
Aviva plc 260 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 54 Capital statement continued The table below provides the information on the UK with-profits funds on a realistic basis.

Realistic liabilities adjusted to eliminate the shareholders' share of future bonuses are 43.2 billion 31 December 2007: 48.8 billion.
These realistic liabilities make provision for guarantees, options and promises on a market consistent stochastic basis.
The value of the provision included within realistic liabilities is 1.4 billion, 1.5 billion and 4.1 billion for CGNU Life, CULAC and NUL&P respectively 31 December 2007: 0.7 billion, 0.8 billion and 3.0 billion for CGNU Life, CULAC and NUL&P respectively.
Estimated realistic inherited estate at 31 December 2008 was 1.4 billion, 1.2 billion and 1.9 billion for CGNU Life, CULAC and NUL&P respectively.
The risk capital margin RCM is 1.8 times covered by the inherited estate 31 December 2007: 3.5 times.
The NUL&P fund includes the Provident Mutual PM fund, which has realistic assets and liabilities of 1.8 billion and therefore does not impact the realistic inherited estate.
Under the FSA regulatory regime, UK life with-profits business is required to hold capital equivalent to the greater of their regulatory requirement based on EU Directives regulatory peak and the FSA realistic bases realistic peak described above.
For UK non-participating business, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with FSA regulations.
The available capital reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of capital resources requirement.
For UK general insurance businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the FSA requirements.
For overseas businesses in the EEA, US, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore, the available capital and the minimum requirement are calculated under the locally applicable regulatory regimes.
The businesses outside these territories are subject to the FSA rules for the purposes of calculation of available capital and capital resource requirement.
For fund management and other businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the local regulators requirements for the specific class of business.
All businesses hold sufficient available capital to meet their capital resource requirement.
The available capital resources in each regulated entity are generally subject to restrictions as to their availability to meet requirements that may arise elsewhere in the Group.
The principal restrictions are: i UK with-profit funds CGNU Life, CULAC and NUL&P any available surplus held in each fund can only be used to meet the requirements of the fund itself or be distributed to policyholders and shareholders.
With-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits while the shareholders receive the balance.
The latter distribution would be subject to a tax charge, which is met by the fund in the case of CGNU Life, CULAC and NUL&P.
ii UK non-participating funds any available surplus held in these is attributable to shareholders.
Capital in the non-profit funds may be made available to meet requirements elsewhere in the Group subject to meeting the regulatory requirements of the fund.
Any transfer of the surplus may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iii Overseas life operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
The available capital resources in all these businesses are subject to local regulatory restrictions which may constrain managements ability to utilise these in other parts of the Group.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iv General insurance operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge, subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 261 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 55 Risk management This note sets out the major risks our businesses face and describes our approach to managing these.
It also gives sensitivity analyses around the major economic and non-economic assumptions that can cause volatility in our earnings and capital requirements.
Further discussion of the impact of current market conditions is included in the Group Chief Executives review page 2 and the Business Review page 32 a Risk management framework Aviva has established a risk management framework to protect the Group from events that hinder the sustainable achievement of its performance objectives, including failing to exploit opportunities.
The risks faced by the Group can be categorised as follows: Financial risks cover market and credit risk, insurance risk, liquidity and capital management.
Strategic risks include issues such as customer, products and markets as well as any risks to our business model arising from changes in or market and risks arising from mergers and acquisitions.
Operational risk arises from inadequately controlled internal processes or systems, human error or noncompliance as well as from external events.
Operational risks include taxation, reputation and regulatory risks, such as compliance.
The risk management framework provides the means to identify, assess, measure, manage and monitor all of the different types of risk faced by the Group to provide a single picture of the threats and uncertainties faced and opportunities that exist.
The Group sets limits to manage material risks to ensure the risk stay within risk appetite the amount of risk the Group is willing to accept.
The Group assesses the size and scale of a risk by considering how likely it is that the risk will occur and the potential impact the risk could have on our business and our stakeholders.
Where risks are outside appetite actions are agreed to mitigate the exposure.
The Groups risk management framework is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable assurance against material financial misstatement or loss.
New risks, which have not been identified as emerging risks, or risks we currently deem as immaterial may also impair the future achievement of business objectives.
The Group recognises the critical importance of maintaining an efficient and effective risk management framework.
To this end, the Group has an established governance framework, which has the following key elements: Defined terms of reference for the Board, its committees, and the associated executive management committees: A clear organisational structure with documented delegated authorities and responsibilities from the Board to Board committees, executive management committees and senior management: A risk management function operating across Group centre, regions and business units, with clear responsibilities and objectives: A Group policy framework that defines risk appetite and sets out risk management and control standards for the Groups worldwide operations.
The policies also set out the roles and responsibilities of businesses, regions, policy owners, and the risk oversight committees: and Risk oversight committees that review and monitor aggregate risk data, assess whether the risk profile is within appetite and take overall risk management decisions.
The committees monitor adherence to the risk management policies and oversee mitigating actions being taken where risks are outside of appetite.
The Group has developed economic capital models that support the measurement, comparison and further understanding of our risks.
The results of the modelling are incorporated into key decision making processes.
These models show the relative impact to economic capital from the risks we face.
In turn this supports the assessment of appropriate and effective mitigating strategies where risks are outside of appetite.
The Financial Services Authority FSA requires Aviva to assess its economic capital requirements to ensure that it adequately reflects business and control risks.
In turn this analysis supports our strategic planning and decisionmaking processes.
Aviva plc 262 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 55 Risk management continued b Market risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, property prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.
Market risk arises in business units due to fluctuations in both the value of liabilities and the value of investments held.
At Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses and in the value of investment assets owned directly by the shareholders.
The Group has established a policy on market risk which sets out the principles that businesses are expected to adopt in respect of management of the key market risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Group monitors adherence to this market risk policy and regularly reviews how business units are managing these risks locally, through the Group Assets Committee and ultimately the Group Asset Liability Committee.
For each of the major components of market risk, described in more detail below, the Group has put in place additional processes and procedures to set out how each risk should be managed and monitored, and the approach to setting an appropriate risk appetite.
The management of market risk is undertaken in both business units and at Group level.
Business units manage market risks locally using their market risk framework and within local regulatory constraints.
Business units may also be constrained by the requirement to meet policyholders reasonable expectations and to minimise or avoid market risk in a number of areas.
The Group Assets Committee is responsible for managing market risk at Group level, and a number of investment-related risks, in particular those faced by shareholder funds throughout the Group.
The financial impact from changes in market risk such as interest rates, equity prices and property values is examined through stress tests adopted in the Individual Capital Assessments ICA and scenario analysis which consider the impact on capital from variations in financial circumstances on either a remote scenario, or to changes from the central operating scenario.
Both assessments consider the management actions that may be taken in mitigation of the change in circumstances.
The sensitivity of Group earnings to changes in economic markets is regularly monitored through sensitivities to investment returns and asset values in MCEV reporting.
The Group market risk policy sets out the minimum principles and framework for matching liabilities with appropriate assets, the approaches to be taken when liabilities cannot be matched and the monitoring processes that are required.
The Group has criteria for matching assets and liabilities for all classes of business to minimise the impact of mismatches between the value of assets and the liabilities due to market movements.
The local regulatory environment for each business will also set the conditions under which assets and liabilities are to be matched.
In addition, where the Groups long-term savings businesses have written insurance and investment products where the majority of investment risks are borne by its policyholders, these risks are managed in line with local regulations and marketing literature, in order to satisfy the policyholders risk and reward objectives.
The Group writes unit-linked business in a number of its operations.
In unit-linked business, the policyholder bears the investment risk on the assets held in the unit-linked funds, as the policy benefits are directly linked to the value of the assets in the fund.
The shareholders exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the fund.
Equity price risk The Group is subject to equity price risk due to daily changes in the market values of its equity securities portfolio.
The Groups shareholders are exposed to the following sources of equity risk: Direct equity shareholdings in shareholder funds and the Group defined benefit pension funds: The indirect impact from changes in the value of equities held in policyholders funds from which management charges or a share of performance are taken: Its interest in the free estate of long-term with profits funds.
At a business unit level, equity price risk is actively managed in order to mitigate anticipated unfavourable market movements where this lies outside the risk appetite of either the company in respect of shareholder assets or the fund in respect of policyholder assets concerned.
In addition local asset admissibility regulations require that business units hold diversified portfolios of assets thereby reducing exposure to individual equities.
The Group does not have material holdings of unquoted equity securities.
Equity risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures and options.
Businesses actively model the performance of equities through the use of stochastic models, in particular to understand the impact of equity performance on guarantees, options and bonus rates.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 263 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 55 Risk management continued The Group Assets Committee actively monitors equity assets owned directly by the Group, which may include some material shareholdings in the Groups strategic business partners.
Sensitivity to changes in equity prices is given in section g below.
Property price risk The Group is subject to property price risk due to holdings of investment properties in a variety of locations worldwide.
Investment in property is managed at business unit level, and will be subject to local regulations on asset admissibility, liquidity requirements and the expectations of policyholders as well as overall risk appetite.
The Group Assets Committee also monitors property assets owned directly by the Group.
As at 31 December 2008, no material derivative contracts had been entered into to mitigate the effects of changes in property prices.
Sensitivity to changes in property prices is given in section g below.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Groups investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities, which are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.
Interest rate risk also exists in products sold by the Group, in particular from policies that carry investment guarantees on early surrender or at maturity, where claim values can become higher than the value of backing assets when interest rates rise or fall.
The Group manages this risk by adopting close asset liability matching criteria, to minimise the impact of mismatches between the value of assets and liabilities from interest rate movements.
A number of policyholder participation features have an influence on the Groups interest rate risk.
The major features include guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values.
Details of material guarantees and options are given in note 40.
In short-term business such as general insurance business the Group requires a close matching of assets and liabilities to minimise this risk.
Interest rate risk is monitored and managed by the Group Assets Committee, and the Group Asset Liability Committee.
Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include Value-at-Risk analysis, position limits, scenario testing, stress testing and asset and liability matching using measures such as duration.
The impact of exposure to sustained low interest rates is regularly monitored.
Interest rate risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures, options, swaps, caps and floors, in order to provide a degree of hedging against unfavourable market movements in interest rates inherent in the assets backing technical liabilities.
As at 31 December 2008, the Group had entered into a number of interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the effects of potential adverse interest rate movements, and to enable closer matching of assets and liabilities.
Sensitivity to changes in interest rates is given in section g below.
Further information on borrowings is included in note 47.
Currency risk The Group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their functional currencies, as nearly all such holdings are backing either unit-linked or with-profit contract liabilities.
For this reason, no sensitivity analysis is given for these holdings.
The Group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies.
Approximately half of the Groups premium income arises in currencies other than sterling and the Groups net assets are denominated in a variety of currencies, of which the largest are euro, sterling, and US dollars.
The Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the Groups business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.
The Groups foreign exchange policy requires that each of our subsidiaries maintains sufficient assets in its local currency to meet local currency liabilities.
Therefore, capital held by the Groups business units should be able to support local business activities regardless of foreign currency movements.
However, such movements may impact the value of the Groups consolidated shareholders equity which is expressed in sterling.
This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits.
The Groups foreign exchange policy is to manage these exposures by aligning the deployment of capital by currency with the Groups capital requirements by currency.
Limits are set to control the extent to which the deployment of capital is not aligned fully with the Groups capital requirement for each major currency.
Currency borrowings and derivatives are used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.
Aviva plc 264 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 55 Risk management continued At 31 December 2008, the Groups total equity deployment by currency was: Sterling Euro US$ Other Total m m m m m Capital 31 December 2008 2,041 7,981 2,130 2,294 14,446 Capital 31 December 2007 3,809 8,667 1,456 1,999 15,931 A 10% change in sterling to euro US$ foreign exchange rates would have had the following impact on total equity.
10% increase 10% decrease 10% increase 10% decrease in sterling in sterling in sterling in sterling euro rate euro rate US$ rate US$ rate m m m m Net assets at 31 December 2008 798 798 213 213 Net assets at 31 December 2007 867 867 146 146 The changes arise from retranslation of business unit balance sheets from their functional currencies into sterling, with movements being taken through the currency translation reserve.
These movements in exchange rates therefore have no impact on profit.
Net assets are stated after taking account of the effect of currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Derivatives risk Derivatives are used by a number of the businesses, within policy guidelines agreed by the Board of directors, as set out in the Group policy on derivatives use.
Activity is overseen by the Derivatives Approvals Committee, which monitors implementation of the policy, exposure levels and approves large or complex transactions proposed by businesses.
Derivatives are primarily used for efficient investment management, risk hedging purposes or to structure specific retail savings products.
Derivative transactions are covered by either cash or corresponding assets and liabilities.
Speculative activity is prohibited, unless prior approval has been obtained from the Derivatives Approvals Committee.
Over the counter derivative contracts are entered into only with approved counterparties and using ISDA documentation and credit support annexes or equivalent in accordance with the Group derivatives policy.
Adherence to the collateral requirements as set out in the Group derivatives and Group credit policies thereby reduces the risk of credit loss.
The Group applies strict requirements to the administration and valuation processes it uses, and has a control framework that is consistent with market and industry practice for the activity that is undertaken.
Correlation risk The Group recognises that identified lapse behaviour and potential increases in consumer expectations are sensitive to and interdependent with market movements and interest rates.
These interdependencies are taken into consideration in the ICA in the aggregation of the financial stress tests with the operational risk assessment and in scenario analysis.
c Credit risk Monitoring credit risk We have a significant exposure to credit risk through our investments in corporate bonds, commercial mortgages, and other asset backed securities.
We hold these investments for the benefit of both our policyholders and shareholders.
Credit risk is the risk of loss in the value of financial assets due to counterparties failing to meet all or part of their obligations.
The Group risk management framework also includes the market related aspect of credit risk.
This is the risk of a fall in the value of fixed interest securities from changes in the perceived worthiness of the issuer and is manifested through changes in the fixed interest securities credit spreads.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 265 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 55 Risk management continued The Groups management of credit risk includes monitoring exposures at a Group level and requiring business units to implement local credit risk processes including limit frameworks.
The local business unit credit risk processes involve the establishment and operation of specific risk management committees and the detailed reporting and monitoring of the financial asset portfolio against pre-established risk criteria.
Individual counterparty exposures are aggregated and monitored at Group level against centrally-set limits reflecting the credit ratings by multiple ratings agencies and the type of exposure.
In addition, the Group evaluates the concentration of exposures by industry sector and geographic region and monitors evolving credit spreads through the Credit Approvals Committee.
Credit ratings Financial assets are graded according to current external credit ratings issued.
AAA is the highest possible rating.
Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB ratings.
Financial assets which fall outside this range are classified as speculative grade.
Credit limits for each counterparty are set based on default probabilities that are in turn based on the rating of the counterparty and the type of exposure concerned.
The following table provides information regarding the aggregated credit risk exposure, for financial assets with external credit ratings, of the Group.
Not rated assets capture assets not rated by external ratings agencies.
Other investments include: 28,990 million of unit trusts and other investment vehicles.
The underlying credit ratings of these assets are not reflected in this analysis.
Derivative financial instruments of 2,911 million representing positions to mitigate the impact of adverse market movements, and Other assets of 2,696 million which are primarily deposits linked to annuities, unit linked liabilities and investment funds.
The Group loan portfolio is principally made up of: Policy loans which are generally collateralised by a lien or charge over the underlying policy, Loans and advances to banks which primarily relate to loans of cash collateral received in stock lending transactions.
These loans are fully collateralised by other securities, and Mortgage loans collateralised by property assets.
Aviva plc 266 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 55 Risk management continued Credit concentration risk The long-term businesses and general insurance businesses are generally not individually exposed to significant concentrations of credit risk due to the regulations, applicable in most markets, limiting investments in individual assets and asset classes supplemented by the Group credit policy and limits framework.
In cases where the business is particularly exposed to credit risk e. g. in respect of defaults on mortgages matching annuity liabilities this risk is translated into a more conservative discount rate used to value the liabilities, creating a greater capital requirement, and this credit risk is actively managed.
The impact of aggregation of credit risk is monitored as described above.
With the exception of Government bonds the largest aggregated counterparty exposure is approximately 0.4% of the Groups total assets.
Reinsurance credit exposures The Group is exposed to concentrations of risk with individual reinsurers, due to the nature of the reinsurance market and the restricted range of reinsurers that have acceptable credit ratings.
The Group operates a policy to manage its reinsurance counterparty exposures, by limiting the reinsurers that may be used and applying strict limits to each reinsurer.
Reinsurance exposures are aggregated with other exposures to ensure that the overall risk is within appetite.
The Credit Approvals Committee has a monitoring role over this risk.
The Groups largest reinsurance counterparty is Muenchener Rueckversicherungs AG including subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2008 the reinsurance asset recoverable from Muenchener Rueckversicherungs AG was 1,693 million.
This exposure is monitored on a regular basis.
In the event of a catastrophic event, the counterparty exposure to a single reinsurer is estimated not to exceed 3.3% of shareholders equity.
Securities finance The Group has significant securities financing operations within the UK.
The risks within this business are mitigated by over collateralisation which is designed to result in minimal residual risk.
The Group operates strict standards around collateral management and controls.
Derivative credit exposures The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk through derivative trades.
This risk is mitigated through collateralising almost all trades the exception being certain FX trade where it has historically been the market norm not to collateralise.
The Group operates strict standards around collateral management and controls including the requirement that all Over the Counter derivatives are supported by credit support annexes and ISDAs.
Unit-linked business As discussed previously, in unit-linked business the policyholder bears the market risk, including credit risk, on investment assets in the unit funds, and the shareholders exposure to credit risk is limited to the extent that their income arises from asset management charges based on the value of assets in the fund.
Impairment of financial assets The following table provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets that have been impaired and the ageing of financial assets that are past due but not impaired.
At 31 December 2008 Financial assets that are past due but not impaired Carrying value in the Financial balance Neither past assets that sheet due nor 6 monthsGreater have been impaired 0-3 months 3-6 months 1 year than 1 year impaired restated m m m m m m m Debt securities 150,141 114150,255 Reinsurance assets 7,867 25 2 7,894 Other investments 36,114 1 136,116 Loans 41,091 227 658 13 11 237 42,237 Receivables and other financial assets 8,932 539 293 33 6 13 9,816 Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 267 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 55 Risk management continued At 31 December 2007 Financial assets that are past due but not impaired Financial Carrying assets that value in the Neither past have been balance due nor 6 monthsGreater impaired sheet impaired 0-3 months 3-6 months 1 year than 1 year m m m m m m m Debt securities 121,241 71 121,312 Reinsurance assets 8,052 2 8,054 Other investments 36,269 36,269 Loans 35,937 210 11 3 15 17 36,193 Receivables and other financial assets 8,337 200 21 13 2 46 8,619 The fair value of collateral held against loans that are past due or impaired at 31 December 2008 was 879 million 2007: 185 million.
This predominantly consists of commercial properties.
Credit terms are set locally within overall credit limits prescribed by the Group Credit Committee and within the framework of the Group Credit Policy.
The credit quality of financial assets is managed at the local business unit level.
Where assets have been classed as past due and impaired, an analysis is made of the risk of default and a decision is made whether to seek collateral from the counterparty.
There were no material financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.
d Liquidity risk The Group and Company have a strong liquidity position and through the application of a Group Liquidity policy seek to maintain sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due.
In addition to this strong liquidity position, the Group and Company maintain significant committed borrowing facilities from a range of highly rated banks to further mitigate this risk.
Analysis of maturity of liabilities For non-linked insurance business, the following table shows the gross liability at 31 December 2008 analysed by remaining duration.
The total liability is split by remaining duration in proportion to the cash-flows expected to arise during that period, as permitted under IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts.
Almost all investment contracts may be surrendered or transferred on demand.
For such contracts the earliest contractual maturity date is therefore the current balance sheet date, for a surrender amount approximately equal to the current balance sheet liability.
We expect surrenders, transfers and maturities to occur over many years, and the tables reflect the expected cash flows for these products.
However, contractually, the total liability for non-linked investment contracts of 60,264 million 2007: 45,492 million would be shown in the Within 1 year column below.
Unit-linked contracts are repayable or transferable on demand and are therefore excluded from this analysis.

Aviva plc 268 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 55 Risk management continued e Insurance risk i Life insurance risk Types of risk Life insurance risk in the Group arises through its exposure to mortality and morbidity insurance and exposure to worse than anticipated operating experience on factors such as persistency levels and management and administration expenses.
Risk management framework The Group has developed a life insurance risk policy and guidelines on the practical application of this policy.
Individual life insurance risks are managed at a business unit level but are also monitored at Group level.
The impact of life insurance risks is monitored by the business units as part of the control cycle of business management.
Exposure is monitored through the assessment of liabilities, the asset liability management framework, profit reporting under both IFRS and MCEV, and the ICA process.
Significant insurance risks will be reported through the Group risk management framework and overseen by the Life Insurance Committee.
At Group level the overall exposure to life insurance risk is measured through the ICA and other management reporting.
The Life Insurance Committee monitors the application of the risk policy in each business, and receives management information on life insurance risks.
The committee considers all areas of life insurance risk, but in particular has a remit to monitor mortality, longevity, morbidity, persistency, product development and pricing, unit pricing and expenses.
The committee also considers the reinsurance coverage across the life businesses.
It confirms that guidance and procedures are in place for each of the major components of life insurance risk, and that the businesses mitigate against any life insurance risk outside local appetite, within the parameters for the overall Group risk appetite.
The committee has also developed guidance for business units on management of a number of areas of life insurance risk to ensure best practice is shared throughout the Group and common standards are adopted.
Management of life insurance risks The individual life insurance risks are managed as follows: Mortality and morbidity risks are mitigated by use of reinsurance.
The Group allows business units to select reinsurers, from those approved by the Group, based on local factors, but assesses the overall programme to manage group-wide risk exposures and monitor the aggregation of risk ceded to individual reinsurers is within appetite for credit risk.
Longevity risk is carefully monitored against the latest external industry data and emerging trends.
Whilst individual businesses are responsible for reserving and pricing for annuity business, the Group monitors the exposure to this risk and the capital implications to manage the impact on the group-wide exposure and the capital funding that businesses may require as a consequence.
The Group has used reinsurance solutions to reduce the risks from longevity where possible and desirable and continually monitors and evaluates emerging market solutions to mitigate this risk further.
Persistency risk is managed at a business unit level through frequent monitoring of company experience, benchmarked against local market information.
Where possible the financial impact of lapses is reduced through appropriate product design.
Businesses also implement specific initiatives to improve retention of policies which may otherwise lapse.
The Group Life Insurance Committee has developed guidelines on persistency management.
Product Design and Pricing risk arises from poorly designed or inadequately priced products and can lead to both financial loss and reputation damage from the Group.
Guidelines have been developed to support the businesses through the complete cycle of the product development process, financial analysis and pricing.
Expense risk is primarily managed by the business units through the assessment of business unit profitability and frequent monitoring of expense levels.
Apart from the ICA, sensitivity testing is widely used to measure the capital required and volatility in earnings due to exposure to life insurance risks, typically through MCEV reporting examples of which are contained elsewhere in this report.
This assessment is taken at both business unit level and at Group level where the impact of aggregation of similar risks can be measured.
This enables the Group to determine whether action is required to reduce risk, or whether that risk is within the overall risk appetite.

The Group assesses the relative costs and concentrations of each type of risk through the ICA capital requirements and material issues are escalated to and addressed at the Life Insurance Committee.
This analysis enables the Group to assess whether accumulations of risk exceeds risk appetite.
One key concentration of life insurance risk for the Group is improving longevity risk from pensions in payment and deferred annuities in the UK and the Netherlands where the Group has material portfolios.
The Group continually monitors this risk and the opportunities for mitigating actions through reinsurance, improved asset liability matching, or innovative solutions that emerge in the market.
When looking at concentrations of risk, for example market risk, the risk within Aviva staff pension schemes is also considered.
ICA analysis and MCEV sensitivity testing help identify both concentrations of risk types and the benefits of diversification of risk Embedded derivatives The Group has exposure to a variety of embedded derivatives in its long-term savings business due to product features offering varying degrees of guaranteed benefits at maturity or on early surrender, along with options to convert their benefits into different products on pre-agreed terms.
The extent of the impact of these embedded derivatives differs considerably between business units.
Examples of each type of embedded derivative affecting the Group are: Options: call, put, surrender and maturity options, guaranteed annuity options, options to cease premium payment, options for withdrawals free of market value adjustment, annuity options, and guaranteed insurability options.
Guarantees: embedded floor guaranteed return, maturity guarantee, guaranteed death benefit, and guaranteed minimum rate of annuity payment.
Other: indexed interest or principal payments, maturity value, loyalty bonus.
The impact of these is reflected in ICA and MCEV reporting and managed as part of the asset liability framework.
ii General insurance risk Types of risk General insurance risk in the Group arises from: Fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of claims and claim settlements relative to expectations: Unexpected claims arising from a single source: Inaccurate pricing of risks or inappropriate underwriting of risks when underwritten: Inadequate reinsurance protection or other risk transfer techniques: and Inadequate reserves.
The majority of the general insurance business underwritten by the Group is of a short tail nature such as motor, household and commercial property insurances.
The Groups underwriting strategy and appetite is agreed by the Executive Committee and communicated via specific policy statements and guidelines.
Like life insurance risk, general insurance risk is managed primarily at business unit level with oversight at a Group level, through the General Insurance Committee.
The vast majority of the Groups general insurance business is managed and priced in the same country as the domicile of the customer.
Management of general insurance risks Significant insurance risks will be reported through the Group risk management framework.
Additionally, the ICA is used to assess the risks that each general insurance business unit, and the Group as a whole, is exposed to, quantifying their impact and calculating appropriate capital requirements.
Increasingly risk-based capital models are being used to support the quantification of risk under the ICA framework.
All general insurance business units undertake a quarterly review of their insurance risks, the output from which is a key input into the ICA and risk-based capital assessments.
The General Insurance Committee monitors and develops the management of insurance risk in the general insurance business units, and assesses the aggregate risk exposure.
It is responsible for the development, implementation, and review of the Group policies for underwriting, claims, reinsurance and reserving that operate within the Group risk management framework.
Aviva plc 270 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 55 Risk management continued Business units have developed mechanisms that identify, quantify and manage accumulated exposures to contain them within the limits of the appetite of the Group.
The Group has pioneered various developments, such as the Norwich Union UK Digital Flood Map to effectively manage exposures arising from specific perils.
Where appropriate such projects are employed throughout the business units to promote the adoption of best practice as standard.
General insurance claims reserving Actuarial claims reserving is conducted by local actuaries in the various general insurance business units according to the General Insurance Reserving policy.
The General Insurance Committee monitors and maintains the General Insurance Reserving policy, and conducts quarterly reviews of the Groups general insurance claims provisions, and their adequacy.
The reviews include peer reviews of the business units own conclusions as well as independent analysis to confirm the reasonableness of the local reviews.
The adequacy of the Groups general insurance claims provisions is ultimately overseen by the General Insurance Committee.
A number of business units also have periodic external reviews by local consultant actuaries often as part of the local regulatory requirement.
Reinsurance strategy Significant reinsurance purchases are reviewed annually at both business unit and Group level, to verify that the levels of protection being bought reflect any developments in exposure and the risk appetite of the Group.
Reinsurance purchases must be in line with the strategy set out in our Group General insurance reinsurance policy.
The basis of these purchases is underpinned by extensive financial and capital modelling and actuarial analysis to optimise the cost and capital efficiency benefits.
For the larger business units, this involves utilising externally sourced probabilistic models to verify the accumulations and loss probabilities based on the Groups specific portfolios of business.
Where external models are not available, scenarios are developed and tested using the Groups data to determine potential losses and appropriate levels of reinsurance protection.
The reinsurance is placed with providers who meet the Groups counterparty security requirements, and large reinsurance placements may also require approval from the Group Asset Liability Committee.
Concentration risk Processes are in place to manage catastrophe risk in individual business units and at a Group level.
The Group cedes much of its worldwide catastrophe risk to third party reinsurers but retains a pooled element for its own account gaining diversification benefit.
Avivas total retained risk increases as catastrophe events become more remote, so that the total Group loss from its most concentrated catastrophe exposure Northern European windstorm is approximately 400 million, on a one in ten years basis, compared to approximately 850 million when measured on a one in 100 years basis.
f Operational risk Types of operational risk Operational risk is the risk of loss, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.
Operational risk management Our businesses are primarily responsible for identifying and managing operational risks in line with minimum standards of control set out in our policies.
Each operational risk is assessed by considering the potential impact and the probability of the event occurring.
Impact assessments are considered against financial, operational and reputation criteria.
Business management teams must be satisfied that all material risks falling outside our risk appetite are being mitigated, monitored and reported to an appropriate level.
Any risks with a high potential impact level are monitored centrally on a regular basis.
Businesses use key indicator data to help monitor the status of the risk and control environment.
They also identify and capture loss events: taking appropriate action to address actual control breakdowns and promote internal learning from these occurrences.
The Group Operational Risk Committee ORC oversees the Groups aggregate operational risk exposure on behalf of the Group Executive Committee and reports to the Board Risk & Regulatory Committee.
It makes recommendations on the risk appetite that the Group can work within for operational risk, assesses and monitors overall operational risk exposures, identifying any concentrations of operational risk across the Group, and in particular verifies that mitigating action plans are implemented.
The ORC operates a number of sub-committees which focus on specific areas of operational risk including business protection, IT, regulatory, people and business standards.
Financial statements IFRS 120 285 Aviva plc 271 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 55 Risk management continued g Risk and capital management Sensitivity test analysis The Group uses a number of sensitivity test-based risk management tools to understand the volatility of earnings, the volatility of its capital requirements, and to manage its capital more efficiently.
Primarily, MCEV, ICA, and scenario analysis are used.
Sensitivities to economic and operating experience are regularly produced on all of the Groups financial performance measurements to inform the Groups decision making and planning processes, and as part of the framework for identifying and quantifying the risks that each of its business units, and the Group as a whole are exposed to.
For long-term business in particular, sensitivities of MCEV performance indicators to changes in both economic and non-economic experience are continually used to manage the business and to inform the decision making process.
More information on MCEV sensitivities can be found in the presentation of results on an MCEV basis in the supplementary section of to this report.
Life insurance and investment contracts The nature of long-term business is such that a number of assumptions are made in compiling these financial statements.
Assumptions are made about investment returns, expenses, mortality rates, and persistency in connection with the in-force policies for each business unit.
Assumptions are best estimates based on historic and expected experience of the business.
A number of the key assumptions for the Groups central scenario are disclosed elsewhere in these statements for both IFRS reporting and reporting under MCEV methodology.
General insurance and health business General insurance and health claim liabilities are estimated by using standard actuarial claims projection techniques.
These methods extrapolate the claims development for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years.
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made as projections are based on assumptions implicit in the historic claims.
Sensitivity test results Illustrative results of sensitivity testing for long-term business, general insurance and health business and the fund management and non-insurance business are set out below.
For each sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor is shown, with other assumptions left unchanged.
Sensitivity factor Description of sensitivity factor applied Interest rate and investment return The impact of a change in market interest rates by a 1% increase or decrease.
The test allows consistently for similar changes to investment returns and movements in the market value of backing fixed interest securities.
Equity property market values The impact of a change in equity property market values by 10%.
Expenses The impact of an increase in maintenance expenses by 10%.
Assurance mortality morbidity The impact of an increase in mortality morbidity rates for assurance life insurance only contracts by 5%.
Annuitant mortality The impact of a reduction in mortality rates for annuity contracts by 5%.
life insurance only Gross loss ratios The impact of an increase in gross loss ratios for general insurance and non-life insurance only health business by 5%.

The sensitivities to economic movements relate mainly to business in the UK, USA and the Netherlands.
In the UK and USA, a fall in market interest rates has a beneficial impact on non-participating business and shareholders funds, due to the increase in market value of fixed interest securities and the relative durations of assets and liabilities: similarly a rise in interest rates has a negative impact.
In the USA most debt securities are classified as available-for-sale, which limits the overall sensitivity of IFRS profit to interest rate movements.
In contrast, a rise in market interest rates has a positive impact for non-participating business in the Netherlands, due to the effect of minimum investment return guarantees, which acts to partly offset the impacts in the UK and USA.
The sensitivity to movements in equity and property market values relates mainly to holdings in the Netherlands, although the impact on IFRS profit is moderated by the classification of equities as available for sale.
Changes in sensitivities between 2007 and 2008 reflect movements in market interest rates, portfolio growth, changes to asset mix and the relative durations of assets and liabilities, and asset liability management actions.
The mortality sensitivities relate primarily to the UK, Netherlands and Ireland.
The impact on the Groups results from sensitivity to these assumptions can also be found in the MCEV sensitivities included in the alternative method of reporting long-term business profits section.

In reality, there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed.
Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
For example, the Groups financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.
As investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocation, adjusting bonuses credited to policyholders, and taking other protective action.
A number of the business units use passive assumptions to calculate their long-term business liabilities.
Consequently, a change in the underlying assumptions may not have any impact on the liabilities, whereas assets held at market value on the balance sheet will be affected.
In these circumstances, the different measurement bases for liabilities and assets may lead to volatility in shareholder equity.
Similarly, for general insurance liabilities, the interest rate sensitivities only affect profit and equity where explicit assumptions are made regarding interest discount rates or future inflation.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analyses include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represent the Groups view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty: and the assumption that all interest rates move in an identical fashion.
56 Derivative financial instruments This note gives details of the various derivative instruments we use to mitigate risk.
The Group uses cash flow, fair value and net investment hedges to mitigate risk, as detailed below.
a Cash flow hedges The Group had no cash flow hedge activity at 31 December 2008 2007: nil.
b Fair value hedges The Group has entered into a number of interest rate swaps in order to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of part of its mortgage loans portfolio.
The notional value of these interest rate swaps was 1,088 million at 31 December 2008 2007: nil and the fair value was 86 million liability 2007: nil.
These hedges were fully effective during the year.
c Net investment hedges To reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, the Group has entered into the following net investment hedges: The Group has designated a portion of its Euro and US dollar denominated debt as a hedge of the net investment in its European and American subsidiaries.
The carrying value of the debt at 31 December 2008 was 2,663 million 2007: 1,988 million and its fair value at that date was 1,755 million 2007: 1,972 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 716 million 2007: loss of 114 million on translation of the debt to sterling at the balance sheet date has been recognised in the hedging instruments reserve in shareholders equity.
This hedge was fully effective throughout the current and prior year.
The Group holds a Sterling Euro cross currency swap derivative, which has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in its European subsidiaries.
During the year, the Group reduced the size of the notional amount from 1 billion to 500 million, realising a loss of 164 million in closing out this part of the contract.
The notional value of the derivative at 31 December 2008 was 500 million 2007: 1,000 million and its fair value at that date was 185 million liability 2007: 27 million.
The fair value loss of 160 million on revaluation of the derivative at the balance sheet date, as well as the 164 million loss realised on closing part of the contract, were recognised in the hedging instruments reserve in shareholders equity.
This hedge was fully effective throughout the year.
The losses on the Groups net investment hedges during the year were more than offset by gains on the relevant subsidiaries which are recognised in the currency translation reserve see note 34.
