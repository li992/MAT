NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2008 1 Segmental information By business segment As described in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2007, the group reorganised its divisional structure on 1st April 2007 creating a new Environmental Technologies Division and a new Fine Chemicals & Catalysts Division.
Fine Chemicals & Catalysts was created by adding the businesses which serve the speciality chemicals and pharmaceutical markets previously reported in Catalysts to Pharmaceutical Materials.
Environmental Technologies is made up of the remaining Catalysts businesses.
Hence, for management purposes the group is now organised into three operating divisions Environmental Technologies, Precious Metal Products and Fine Chemicals & Catalysts.
Their principal activities are described on pages 15 to 21.
Sales between segments are made at market prices, taking into account the volumes involved.

Information on the directors remuneration is given in the Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 51.
12 Share-based payments Share options Equity settled share options were granted to employees at the average of the market value of the companys shares over the three days prior to the date of grant and are subject to performance targets over a three year period and have a maximum life of ten years.
The number of shares over which options were granted was based on a percentage of the employees salary and from 2001 to 2006 approximately 800 employees have been granted options each year.
In 2007 a new long term incentive plan was introduced and allocations of shares under this plan replaced the granting of share options.
No share options were granted in the year ended 31st March 2008.
Options granted in 2004 to 2006 are subject to a minimum three year performance target of earnings per share EPS growth of UK RPI plus 3% per annum.
Other performance targets are EPS growth of UK RPI plus 4% per annum and EPS growth of UK RPI plus 5% per annum.
If the performance targets are not met at the end of the three year performance period, the options will lapse.
Also, gains are capped at 100% of the grant price.
Options granted in 2001 to 2003 can only be exercised if the normalised EPS has grown by at least UK RPI plus 4% per annum over any three consecutive years during the life of the options.
They are subject to annual retesting until they lapse on the tenth anniversary of grant.
Since the targets have been met all these options are exercisable.
Some options granted in 2000 and before are still outstanding.
These were subject to a performance target of EPS growth of UK RPI plus 2% over the three year performance period.
Since that target has been met all these options are exercisable.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The new LTIP also replaced share allocations made under the previous LTIP.
Under the new LTIP, shares are allocated to approximately 800 employees based on a percentage of salary and are subject to performance targets over a three year period.
At 31st March 2008, shares allocated in 2007 were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired.
The minimum release of 15% of the allocation is subject to the achievement of a EPS growth of 6% compound per annum over the three year period.
For the maximum release of 100% of the allocation, EPS must have grown by at least 15% compound per annum.
The number of allocated shares released will vary on a straight line basis between these points.
Allocations will lapse if the EPS growth is less than 6% compound per annum over the three year performance period.
Under the old LTIP, shares were allocated to directors and certain key executives of the group based upon a percentage of salary and are subject to performance conditions over a three year period.
At 31st March 2008, shares allocated in 2005 and 2006 at 31st March 2007, shares allocated in 2004, 2005 and 2006 were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired.
The release of shares is subject to a relative total shareholder return TSR compared to those companies ranked 51 to 150 in the FTSE index over a three year period.
All shares are released if the company ranks in the 76th percentile or above.
None of the shares are released if the company ranks in the 50th percentile or below.
If the company ranks between these percentiles 35% and 100% of the shares are released on a straight line basis.
In addition EPS growth must be at least equal to UK RPI plus 2% per annum over the three year performance period before any release is made.
Share Incentive Plan SIP UK and Overseas Under the SIP, all employees with at least one year of service with the group and who are employed by a participating group company are entitled to contribute up to 2.5% of basic pay each month, subject to a 125 per month limit.
The SIP trustees buy shares partnership shares at market value each month with the employees contributions.
For each partnership share purchased, the group purchases two shares matching shares which are allocated to the employee.
In the UK SIP, if the employee sells or transfers partnership shares within three years from the date of allocation, the linked matching shares are forfeited.
In the Overseas SIP, partnership shares and matching shares are subject to a three year holding period and cannot be sold or transferred during that time.
Annual Report & Accounts 2008 69 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2008 12 Share-based payments continued 401k approved savings investment plans 401k plans In the US there are two 401k plans, one for salaried employees and one for hourly employees.
Salaried employees may contribute up to 50% of their base pay and hourly employees up to 20% of their base pay, both subject to a statutory limit.
Salaried employees choosing Johnson Matthey Plc shares matching are matched 100% of the first 4% contributed and hourly employees are matched 50% of the first 2% contributed.
Employees may contribute after one month of service and are eligible for matching after one year of service.
Further details of the directors remuneration under share-based payment plans are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 51.
Activity relating to share options was: 2008 2008 2007 2007 Weighted Weighted average average exercise exercise Number of price Number of price options pence options pence Outstanding at the start of the year 9,383,762 1,017.26 8,189,652 948.23 Granted during the year 1,991,140 1,277.92 Forfeited during the year 112,788 1,086.53 548,057 999.14 Exercised during the year 4,324,728 922.20 248,973 871.05 Outstanding at the end of the year 4,946,246 1,098.81 9,383,762 1,017.26 Exercisable at the end of the year 1,387,814 908.05 364,641 771.71 Options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year.
The average share price during the year was 1,727.49 pence 2007 1,411.78 pence.
An adjusted BlackScholes option pricing model was used to determine the fair value of the options granted.
The inputs to the model were share price 1,299 pence, exercise price 1,282 pence, expected volatility 18.7%, expected option life 5 years, expected dividend rate 2.32% and risk free interest rate 4.77%.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the companys share price over the previous three years.
The expected option life took into account the effects of expected early exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on the history of previous option grants.
Given the low employee turnover and the consistency of the historical average option life Black-Scholes was considered to be a suitable stochastic model to use for fair valuing Johnson Mattheys share options.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model was adjusted to take account of the cap which reduces the benefit and cost appearing in the accounts.
70 Johnson Matthey NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2008 12 Share-based payments continued The fair value of the shares allocated during the year under the LTIP was 1,613.5 pence per share allocation 2007 504.7 pence per share allocation.
The fair value was based on the share price at the date of allocation of 1,711.0 pence 2007 1,283.0 pence adjusted for the present value of the expected dividends that will not be received at an expected dividend rate of 1.96% 2007 2.35%.
The fair value of the shares allocated in the year ended 31st March 2007 was adjusted to take account of the TSR performance condition.
Activity relating to the LTIP was: 2008 2007 Number of Number of allocated allocated shares shares Outstanding at the start of the year 1,109,258 1,221,994 Allocated during the year 627,429 336,483 Forfeited during the year 9,607 14,808 Released during the year 296,096 198,730 Expired during the year 120,788 235,681 Outstanding at the end of the year 1,310,196 1,109,258 223,335 2007 289,696 matching shares under the SIP and 58,876 2007 71,879 shares under the 401k plans were allocated to employees during the year.
They are nil cost awards on which performance conditions are substantially completed at the date of grant.
Consequently the fair value of these awards is based on the market value of the shares at that date.
The total expense recognised during the year in respect of equity settled share-based payments, taking into account expected lapses due to leavers and the probability that EPS performance conditions will not be met, was 9.8 million 2007 11.8 million.
13 Post-employment benefits 13a Group The group operates a number of post-employment benefits plans around the world, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The majority of the plans are defined benefit which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds and retirement benefits are based on factors such as employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Some of the plans are defined contribution, where the retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
The group also makes payments to employees personal pension plans.
The amount recognised as an expense for defined contribution plans was 3.1 million 2007 2.8 million.
The major defined benefit plans are pension plans and post-retirement medical plans in the UK and the US.
The pension plans are final salary plans except for the new section of the UK plan which is a career average salary plan and the US hourly plan which is a fixed benefit based upon years of service.
Full actuarial valuations were carried out at 1st April 2006 for the main UK pension plan and 30th June 2007 for the US pension plans and the valuations of all of the UK and US plans were updated to 31st March 2008 by qualified independent actuaries.
The main assumptions were: 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 UK plans US plans Other plans UK plans US plans Other plans %%% %%% Rate of increase in salaries 5.00 4.25 2.91 4.60 4.25 3.52 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.50 2.20 3.10 2.13 Discount rate 6.50 6.50 5.45 5.40 6.00 4.87 Inflation 3.50 2.75 1.57 3.10 2.75 2.34 Current medical benefits cost trend rate 7.50 8.00 4.00 7.10 9.00 4.00 Ultimate medical benefits cost trend rate 7.50 5.00 4.00 7.10 5.00 4.00 The group uses certain mortality assumptions when calculating plan obligations.
The current mortality assumptions for all major plans retain prudent allowance for future improvements in longevity and take account of experience.
Annual Report & Accounts 2008 71 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2008 13 Post-employment benefits continued 13a Group continued The mortality tables used for the groups largest plan, which is in the UK, at its last full actuarial valuation were PMA92C2006 with a one and a half years positive age rating for male members retiring in normal health and PFA92C2006 with a one and a half years positive age rating for female members retiring in normal health.
Allowance for future mortality improvements was made in line with the medium cohort versions of these tables.

As a result of the change in divisional structure note 1 the cash-generating units have been reorganised onto the same basis.
Goodwill is allocated as follows: Group Parent company 2008 2007 2008 2007 restated restated million million million million Environmental Technologies Argillon Group 77.6 Process Technologies 223.0 216.9 132.4 132.4 Other Environmental Technologies 2.6 3.4 Precious Metal Products 4.2 3.9 Fine Chemicals & Catalysts Macfarlan Smith including the business of United Farmaceuticals Limited 117.1 117.1 117.1 117.1 Catalysts and Chemicals 19.6 19.0 Pharma Services Ireland 17.4 17.6 Research Chemicals 21.3 21.3 482.8 399.2 249.5 249.5 The group and parent company test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management, generally covering a three year period.
The budgets and plans are based on a number of key assumptions including market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, the likelihood and timing of new product launches, foreign exchange rates, precious metal prices and other direct input costs.
Market share, changes in selling prices, product profitability, precious metal prices and other direct input costs are based on past experience and managements expectations of future changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate.
Foreign exchange rates are based on actual rates at the time the budgets were prepared and are held constant over the three years.
New product launches are based on managements best estimate of what may happen.
Apart from as discussed below, it is not considered that a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would generate a different impairment test outcome.
These cash flows are then extrapolated using the long term average growth rates for the relevant products, industries and countries in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows are discounted at the groups estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.3% 2007 11.2%, as this is considered to be a discount rate a typical third party purchaser would also use to value the significant CGUs.
For Process Technologies the long term average growth rate is 8% 2007 5%, for Research Chemicals 5% 2007 5%, for Catalysts and Chemicals 5% 2007 4%, for Macfarlan Smith 5% 2007 5% and for Argillon Group 10%.
For Pharma Services Ireland, where its cash flows are expected to grow significantly due to new prostaglandin product launches over the next few years, cash flow projections cover a four 2007 five year period and then a long term average growth rate of 5% 2007 6% is used to extrapolate these cash flows.
If some of these product launches do not happen as expected an impairment loss may arise.

Market risk includes currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
The main financial risks managed by the group and parent company, under policies approved by the board, are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The group and parent company use derivative financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and currency swaps, to manage their financial risks associated with their underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Some derivative financial instruments used to manage financial risk are not designated as hedges and so are classified as held for trading.
The group and parent company do not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
28a Interest rate risk The groups and parent companys interest rate risk arises from their fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
Their policy is to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings and equity.
They manage their risk by reviewing the profile of their debt regularly and by selectively using interest rate and cross currency swaps to maintain borrowings in appropriate currencies and at competitive rates.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed rate to US dollar floating rate swaps as fair value hedges as they hedge the changes in fair value of bonds attributable to changes in interest rates.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed interest rate to sterling fixed interest rate cross currency swaps as cash flow hedges as they hedge the movement in the cash flows of the hedged bonds attributable to changes in the US dollar sterling exchange rate.
The cash flows are expected to occur in 2010 and 2015 when the respective bonds which they hedge mature.
The interest element of the cash flow hedges is realised in the income statement each year and the exchange effect is expected to be realised in the income statement in 2010 and 2015.
At 31st March 2008, 30% 2007 51% of the groups net debt and 30% 2007 45% of the companys net debt was at fixed rates with an average interest rate of 5.20% 2007 5.20%.
The remaining debt is funded on a floating rate basis.
Based on the groups net debt funded at floating rates, after taking into account the effect of the swaps, a 1% change in all interest rates would have a 4.3 million 2007 1.8 million impact on the groups profit before tax.
This is within the range the board regards as acceptable.
28b Liquidity risk The groups and parent companys policy on funding capacity is to ensure that they always have sufficient long term funding and committed bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.
At 31st March 2008, the group and parent company had borrowings under committed bank facilities of 230.7 million 2007 15.4 million.
The group and parent company also have a number of uncommitted facilities, including metal leases, and overdraft lines at their disposal.

Sales to individual customers are frequently high if the value of precious metals is included in the price.
The failure of any such company to honour its debts could materially impact the groups and parent companys results.
The group and parent company derive significant benefit from trading with their large customers and manage the risk at many levels.
Each business and division has a credit committee that regularly monitors its exposure.
The Audit Committee receives a report every six months that details all significant credit limits, amounts due and amounts overdue within the group and the relevant actions being taken.
At 31st March 2008 trade receivables for the group amounted to 568.9 million 2007 469.5 million parent company 234.1 million 2007 185.0 million.
382.5 million 2007 286.7 million of these receivables at group level 161.5 million 2007 124.2 million at parent company level arose in Emission Control Technologies ECT which is part of Environmental Technologies Division and mainly supplies the automotive industry including car and truck manufacturers and component suppliers.
Although ECT has a wide spread of the available customers the concentrated nature of this industry means that amounts owed by individual customers can be large.
Other parts of the group tend to sell to a larger number of customers and amounts owed tend to be lower.
As at 31st March 2008 and at 31st March 2007 for the group as a whole, no single outstanding balance exceeded 2% of the companys market capitalisation.
No assets have been taken possession of as collateral.
The credit profiles of the groups and parent companys customers are obtained from credit rating agencies and closely monitored.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
Generally, payments in the automotive industry and in the other markets in which the group operates are made promptly.
Trade receivables are considered impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are in financial difficulty or for other reasons which imply there is doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
Trade receivables can be analysed as: Group Parent company 2008 2007 2008 2007 million million million million Amounts neither past due nor impaired 494.7 403.3 210.8 164.7 Amounts past due but not impaired less than 30 days 53.0 51.4 16.0 14.7 30 90 days 13.3 11.1 5.4 4.1 more than 90 days 8.4 4.5 2.0 1.5 Total past due but not impaired 74.7 67.0 23.4 20.3 Amounts impaired 5.7 3.2 1.2 0.9 Specific allowances for bad and doubtful debts 5.5 2.9 1.1 0.6 Carrying amount of impaired receivables 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.3 General allowances for bad and doubtful debts 0.7 1.1 0.2 0.3 Trade receivables net of allowances 568.9 469.5 234.1 185.0 Movements in the allowance for impairments were: Group Parent company 2008 2007 2008 2007 million million million million At 1st April 2007 4.0 6.4 0.9 1.2 Charge for year 2.3 0.3 0.4 0.1 Utilised 0.2 0.5 0.3 Disposal of businesses 1.9 0.1 Exchange adjustments 0.1 0.3 At 31st March 2008 6.2 4.0 1.3 0.9 Financial assets included in sundry receivables are all current and not impaired.
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are banks with high credit ratings not less than AA.
As at 31st March 2008, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was 36.3 million 2007 11.3 million for the group and 13.0 million 2007 7.0 million for the parent company, whilst the largest mark to market exposure for forward foreign exchange contracts to a single bank was 1.8 million 2007 0.8 million for the group and parent company.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the groups and parent companys maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
The group guarantees its share of the borrowings and precious metal leases of its associates and its exposure at 31st March 2008 was 1.1 million 2007 0.8 million.
At 31st March 2008 the group and parent company guaranteed nil 2007 3.3 million of the borrowings of subsidiaries of Endeka Ceramics, former subsidiaries of the group note 40.
The parent company also guarantees some of its subsidiaries borrowings, partly through interest netting arrangements, and precious metal leases and its exposure at 31st March 2008 was 62.1 million 2007 16.1 million.
Annual Report & Accounts 2008 89 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2008 28 Financial risk management continued 28d Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is approximately equal to book value except for: 2008 2007 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value Group million million million million US Dollar Bonds 2010, 2013, 2015 and 2016 253.7 244.2 240.6 242.8 US Dollar EIB Loan 2011 50.3 51.7 51.0 50.9 Sterling Bonds 2013 40.0 38.6 40.0 38.5 2008 2007 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value Parent company million million million million Amounts receivable from subsidiaries 1,537.2 1,544.3 1,111.4 1,109.7 US Dollar Bonds 2010, 2013, 2015 and 2016 253.7 244.2 240.6 242.8 US Dollar EIB Loan 2011 50.3 51.7 51.0 50.9 Sterling Bonds 2013 40.0 38.6 40.0 38.5 The fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates prevailing at the year end.
It is not possible to determine reliably the fair value of the groups unquoted available-for-sale investments which have a book value of 5.2 million 2007 4.8 million as there is no active market.
These are investments in a company that is in the start up phase and in an investment vehicle that invests in start up companies and so there is a wide range of possible values.
Given their size it would be overly onerous to provide additional detail.
28e Foreign currency risk The group operates globally with the majority of its profits earned outside the UK.
In order to protect the groups sterling balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk the group has financed most of its investment in the USA, Europe, Japan and China by borrowing US dollars, euros, yen and renminbi respectively.
Although an element of this funding is obtained by directly borrowing the relevant currency, a large part is achieved through currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs and credit exposure.
The group has designated the currency swaps and one loan fair value 18.1 million 2007 15.4 million as hedges of net investments in foreign operations as they hedge the changes in values of the subsidiaries net assets against movements in exchange rates.
The main currencies of the net debt after taking into account the effect of the currency swaps were: Group Group Parent company Parent company Borrowings Borrowings Cash Cash Borrowings Borrowings Cash Cash 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 million million million million million million million million Sterling 130.7 105.3 177.5 192.7 126.8 102.1 173.3 186.4 US dollar 166.7 170.5 13.9 12.1 157.5 164.6 5.6 1.1 Euro 421.6 232.2 446.9 250.2 Japanese yen 58.3 57.9 61.8 60.3 South African rand 48.5 24.8 5.5 15.4 Hong Kong dollar 26.2 17.4 2.4 11.8 Canadian dollar 1.0 7.3 2.0 7.1 Chinese renminbi 16.0 7.2 2.1 4.1 6.0 5.5 Swiss franc 7.3 5.9 0.9 2.2 Indian rupee 5.9 1.8 0.6 Swedish krone 6.6 0.2 6.8 0.5 Other currencies 5.4 6.4 13.2 7.9 2.6 2.4 0.8 0.4 859.7 605.5 249.3 240.7 813.9 605.4 199.5 190.1 The group and parent company use forward exchange contracts, and occasionally currency options, to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
These are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The majority of the cash flows are expected to occur and the hedge effect realised in the income statement in the year ending 31st March 2009.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar and a 5% 10.0 cent 2007 9.5 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a 3.6 million 2007 3.7 million impact on operating profit.
The group is also exposed to the euro and a 5% 7.1 cent 2007 7.4 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 1.7 million 2007 1.5 million impact on operating profit.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates.
90 Johnson Matthey NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2008 28 Financial risk management continued 28e Foreign currency risk continued For financial instruments the main exposures are to the US dollar and euro and are due to loans, swaps and cash flow hedges on forecast receipts and payments.
A 5% 9.9 cent 2007 9.8 cent movement in the closing exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a 1.9 million 2007 2.4 million impact on operating profit and an 11.4 million 2007 9.9 million impact on equity for these instruments.
A 5% 6.3 cent 2007 7.4 cent movement in the closing exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 2.4 million 2007 3.4 million impact on operating profit and a 28.0 million 2007 14.1 million impact on equity for these instruments.
However, the impact in operating profit relates primarily to the cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have occurred in the year and so would be offset by similar movements in the hedged items.
Similarly, the impact on equity relates primarily to foreign exchange positions used to hedge the subsidiaries net assets and so would be offset by an equal and opposite movement in the value of the relevant subsidiaries net assets.
The remaining impact on equity of 3.7 million 2007 1.9 million for the US dollar and 6.7 million 2007 2.4 million for the euro relates to cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have yet to occur.
28f Capital management The groups policy for managing capital is to maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure that the group always has sufficient resources to be able to invest in future growth.
The group has a long term target range for gearing net debt equity of 50% to 60% although in any given year gearing may fall outside this range depending on future plans.
See the section on capital structure in the financial review on page 13 for more information.

Argillon Group On 6th February 2008 the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Argillon Group Argillon.
Argillon specialises in catalysts and advanced ceramic materials and sells a range of products into a number of different industries.
The goodwill arising is attributable to the synergistic opportunity to take the existing Argillon technology together with Johnson Mattheys capital resources, technological expertise and commercial teams in businesses across the world, to develop new products to service new markets.
There will also be synergies in combining the group and Argillons complementary catalyst operations.
The acquisition of Argillon adds valuable technology to Johnson Mattheys existing emission control capabilities for controlling oxides of nitrogen NOx.
As well as products for the heavy duty diesel HDD truck market, Argillon manufactures catalysts for power plants, industrial applications and waste incineration plants.
These products have application in coal fired power stations to reduce harmful NOx emissions.
This could become a major market in a few years time as coal is increasingly used to produce electricity and people around the world become more concerned about air quality.
The acquisition of Argillon also adds to Emission Control Technologies existing business selling NOx control systems for large stationary engines and in marine applications.
Johnson Matthey estimates that the HDD catalyst market for mobile applications will grow from approximately US $700 million of sales excluding precious metals in 2008 to US $3 billion by the end of 2014 driven by legislation requiring much reduced levels of emissions which is due to come into force over the next six years.
Argillons products can be used to meet some of these legislative standards but they are more likely to be used in combination with other technology which has been developed by Johnson Matthey.
By combining Argillons and Johnson Mattheys technology, testing facilities and global sales capability sales of Argillons products are likely to be significantly higher than Argillon could achieve on its own.
In addition, in the next decade the board believes there will be significant opportunities for new products for NOx control to meet standards yet to be promulgated given global concerns about air quality and global warming.
The combination of Argillons and Johnson Mattheys technology and research and development capabilities should provide significantly better opportunities for developing successful products for these markets than the sum of the two businesses on a stand alone basis.

The group and parent company have made appropriate estimates when applying the accounting policies, but the actual outcome may differ from those calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Post-employment benefits The groups and parent companys defined benefit plans are assessed annually by qualified independent actuaries.
The details of the plans and assumptions used are described in note 13.
Goodwill The group has capitalised goodwill of 482.8 million and the parent company has 249.5 million.

Taxation The tax payable on profits is determined based on tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the numerous jurisdictions in which the group operates.
Where the precise impact of these laws and regulations is unclear then reasonable estimates may be used to determine the tax charge included in the accounts.
If the tax eventually payable or reclaimable differs from the amounts originally estimated then the difference will be charged or credited in the accounts for the year in which it is determined.
