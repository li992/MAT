Excluding 999 year leases, the average loan term for these properties is 50 years and the average borrowing rate has been determined at the inception of the lease to be 8.9%.
In addition the Group leases certain fixtures and equipment under finance leases, the obligations for which are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
The average lease term is 3-4 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the average implicit borrowing rate was 14.9% 2007: 14.9%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
All lease obligations, which are denominated in Sterling, are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
e Loan notes Included in borrowings due within the year are 3.9m 2007: 15.4m in respect of loan notes issued as consideration for the acquisition of two groups during 1999 and 2000.
The loan notes of 0.3m issued in 1999 to acquire Sharpe and Fisher can be redeemed on 31 January and 31 July each year, the final redemption date being 31 January 2010.
The 3.6m of loan notes issued for the acquisition of the business of Broombys Limited are redeemable on 30 June and 31 December each year until the final redemption date of 30 June 2015.
The loan notes of 7.7m issued in 2007 to acquire Tile Giant Ltd were redeemed during the year.
BORROWINGS continued f Interest The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: 2008 2007 % % Unsecured senior notes 5.8 5.8 Bank loans and overdraft 6.3 6.4 Other borrowings 5.1 5.6 Bank term loans and revolving credit facilities of 1,000m 2007: 883.6m were arranged at variable interest rates.
The $400m unsecured senior notes were issued at fixed rates of interest and swapped into variable rates.
This exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
As detailed in note 25, to manage the risk the Group entered into interest rate derivatives arrangements, which for 2008, fixed interest rates on 655.5m of borrowing.
For the year to 31 December 2008 this had the effect of reducing the weighted average interest rates paid by 0.4%.

There were no significant differences between book and fair values on this basis and therefore no further information is disclosed.
Details about the fair values of derivatives are given in note 25.
