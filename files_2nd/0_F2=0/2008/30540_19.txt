Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 1 Accounting policies The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
These comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, together with interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies the AIC in January 2003 revised in December 2005 is consistent with the requirements of IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
b Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, are set out in the Business Review section of the Directors Report on pages 7 to 19.
The financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2008 is shown in the balance sheet on page 41.
The cash ows of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2008, which are not untypical, are set out on page 42.
The Company had xed debt and preference share capital totalling 140,087,000, as set out in note 13 on page 51: none of the borrowings is repayable before 2016.
The Group has no short term borrowings or borrowing facilities.
Note 14 on pages 51 to 56 sets out the Groups risk management policies and procedures, including those covering currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
As at 31 December 2008 the Groups total assets less current liabilities exceeded its total non current liabilities by a multiple of over seven.
The assets of the Group consist mainly of securities that are held in accordance with the Companys investment policy, as set out on page 13.
Most of these securities are readily realisable even in the more volatile markets experienced in recent months and despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
The directors consider that the Company has adequate financial resources to enable it to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Groups accounts.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entity controlled by the Company its subsidiary made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
d Presentation of Income Statement In order to better reect the activities of an investment trust company, and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Income Statement.
In accordance with the Companys status as a UK investment company under section 266 of the Companies Act 1985, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the directors believe appropriate in assessing the Groups compliance with certain requirements set out in section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. e Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no exdividend date is available, dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The xed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short term deposits is accrued to the end of the period.
Stock lending fees and underwriting commission are recognised as earned.
Where the Group has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of shares received over the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised as a gain in the Income Statement.
43 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 continued 1 Accounting policies continued f Expenses All expenses and interest payable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are presented as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fees and finance costs are allocated 25% to revenue and 75% to capital to reect the Boards expectations of long term investment returns.
Any performance fees payable are allocated wholly to capital, reecting the fact that, although they are calculated on a total return basis, they are expected to be attributable largely, if not wholly, to capital performance.
Transaction costs incurred on the acquisition or disposal of investments are expensed and included in the costs of acquisition or deducted from the proceeds of sale as appropriate.
g Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were applicable at the balance sheet date.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Income Statement is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Income Statement then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Investment Trusts which have approval as such under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
h Investments held at fair value through profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
All the Groups investments are dened by IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
All investments are designated upon initial recognition as held at fair value through profit or loss, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Investments in unit trusts or OEICs are valued at the closing price, the bid price or the single price as appropriate, released by the relevant investment manager.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or for investments for which there is only an inactive market, are established by using various valuation techniques.
These may include recent arms length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash ow analysis, option pricing models and reference to similar quoted companies.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost, subject to any provision for impairment.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
44 1 Accounting policies continued j Dividends payable Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are not recognised until approved by the shareholders in general meeting.
k Non current liabilities All debentures and secured bonds are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, less issue costs where applicable.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on settlement.
The costs of arranging any interest-bearing loans are capitalised and amortised over the life of the loan.
l Foreign currency translation Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are fair valued and denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated into sterling at the rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Income Statement.
m Adoption of new and revised Standards In the current year, two interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the current period.
These are: IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions and IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Dened benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The adoption of these interpretations has not led to any changes in the Groups accounting policies.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but were not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 1 amended IAS 27 amended Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate IFRS 2 amended Share-based Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations IFRS 3 revised 2008 Business Combinations IFRS 8 Operating Segments IAS 1 revised 2007 Presentation of Financial Statements IAS 23 revised 2007 Borrowing Costs IAS 27 revised 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 32 amended IAS 1 amended Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation Improvements to IFRSs May 2008 The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for segment additional disclosures when IFRS 8 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. n Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprise forward exchange contracts the purpose of which is to manage currency risks arising from the Companys investing activities, quoted options on shares held within the portfolio, or on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings and futures contracts on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio one purpose for which may be to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings.
The Company may also write options on shares represented in the portfolio where such options are priced attractively relative to the investment managers longer term expectations for the relevant share prices.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies as approved by the Board, which has set written principles for the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Income Statement as they arise.
If capital in nature, the associated change in value is presented as a capital item in the Income Statement.

The difference is explained below.
Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 000 000 Loss profit before taxation 277,514 77,646 Corporation tax at 28.5% 2007: 30% 79,091 23,294 Effects of: Non-taxable UK dividends 3,891 5,200 Non-taxable stock dividends 68 14 Withholding tax written off 1,702 1,614 Double taxation relief 1,650 1,623 Non-taxable losses gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss 84,820 16,465 Unused loan relationship deficits for the period 104 8 Disallowed expenses 4 Income taxable in different periods 40 13 Preference dividends not deductible in determining taxable profit 24 25 80,793 21,680 Current tax charge for the year 1,702 1,614 c Deferred tax Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on income outstanding at the end of the year as this will be covered by unrelieved business charges and eligible unrelieved foreign tax 2007: nil.
d Factors that may affect future tax charges The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 11,752,000 2007: 11,673,000 arising as a result of having unrelieved loan relationship deficits and eligible unrelieved foreign tax.
It is unlikely that the Company will obtain relief for these in the future so no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
48 8 Dividends Year ended Year ended 31 December 31December 2008 2007 000 000 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2007 of 5.80p 2006: 5.30p per ordinary share 12,849 13,694 First interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 4.30p 2007: 4.10p per ordinary share 9,288 10,024 Write-back of unclaimed dividends relating to prior years 11 22,137 23,707 Second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 5.90p 2007: 5.80p per ordinary share 12,629 12,849 The second interim dividend has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
Set out below is the total dividend to be paid in respect of the year.
This is the basis on which the requirements of section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are considered.
Year ended Year ended 31 December 31December 2008 2007 000 000 First interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 4.30p 2007: 4.10p per ordinary share 9,288 10,024 Second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 5.90p 2007: second interim dividend of 5.80p per ordinary share 12,629 12,849 21,917 22,873 9 Earnings loss per ordinary share The earnings per ordinary share gure is based on the net loss for the year of 279,216,000 year ended 31 December 2007: gain of 76,032,000 and on 217,695,259 ordinary shares year ended 31 December 2007: 244,901,514, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The earnings per ordinary share gure detailed above can be further analysed between revenue and capital, as below.
The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share.
Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same.
These comprise mainly stamp duty and commission.

Secured Bonds due 2025, net of discount and issue costs totalling approximately 2,000,000.
The discount and the issue costs will be written back over the life of the Secured Bonds.
The nominal value of the Secured Bonds is redeemable on 15 December 2025.
The nominal value of the Debenture Stock is redeemable on 1 October 2016.
The Debenture Stock and the Secured Bonds are secured by oating charges over all the undertaking and assets of the Company.
The security of the charges applies pari passu to both issues.
During the year the Company purchased for cancellation 6,900,000 of its Secured Bonds at an aggregate cost of 7,518,000.
14 Financial instruments Risk management policies and procedures As an investment company, Witan invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective as stated on page 1.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These risks, market risk comprising price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, and the directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to manage the risks, as set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period, although in some instances additional resources have been allocated to some areas.
51 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 continued 14 Financial instruments continued 14.1 Market risk The fair value or future cash ows of a financial instrument held by the Company may uctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises: price risk see note 14.2, currency risk see note 14.3 and interest rate risk see note 14.4.
The Board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained substantially unchanged from those applying in the year ended 31 December 2007.
The investment managers assess the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitor the overall level of market risk on the whole of their investment portfolios on an ongoing basis.
14.2 Price risk Price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board of directors manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolios by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the investment managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the managers compliance with their mandates and also whether each mandate and asset allocation is compatible with Witans objective.
When appropriate, Witan has the ability to manage its exposure to risk by buying selling put or call options on indices and on equity investments in its portfolios.
The Companys exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December on its quoted and unquoted equity investments, and on options on indices and investments, was as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 880,013 1,276,354 Concentration of exposure to price risks An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on page 18.
This shows that the greater geographical weighting is to UK companies, with significant exposure also to North America, Continental Europe and Japan.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those regions, although an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the value of the shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair values of the Companys equity investments including equity exposure through options.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions and historic trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and equity exposure through options at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

As a consequence, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
In addition, the Board has appointed a currency manager which aims to add value by taking positions in currencies and which therefore has an impact of fund values.
52 14 Financial instruments continued Management of the risk The investment managers and the currency manager monitor their exposure to currencies as part of their normal investment processes.
The Board receives a monthly report on the currency exposures of the entire fund.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling upon receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure With the exception of the underlying exposures held within the currency loan note, the fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 December are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after tax for the year and the Companys equity in regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for the US dollar, Euro and Japanese yen.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US dollar - 15% 2007: 10% Euro - 15% 2007: 7% Japanese yen - 15% 2007: 10% These percentages have been determined by taking in each case the highest range seen in each of the last seven calendar years.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at the balance sheet date and takes account of forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.
53 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 continued 14 Financial instruments continued If sterling had depreciated against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2008 2007 US$ Euro Yen US$ Euro Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 481 1,042 350 260 306 108 Capital return 31,229 25,867 22,212 24,179 14,457 15,353 Change to the profit after tax 31,710 26,909 22,562 24,439 14,763 15,461 Change to the shareholders funds 31,710 26,909 22,562 24,439 14,763 15,461 If sterling had appreciated against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2008 2007 US$ Euro Yen US$ Euro Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 356 770 259 213 266 88 Capital return 23,080 19,089 16,418 19,783 12,565 12,563 Change to the profit after tax 23,436 19,859 16,677 19,996 12,831 12,651 Change to the shareholders funds 23,436 19,859 16,677 19,996 12,831 12,651 In the opinion of the directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses are representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently, as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objective.
14.4 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable from xed interest securities and cash at bank and on deposit.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash ows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Company holds significant cash balances, partially to meet payments as they fall due but also to offset the long term borrowings that it has in place.
The Company nances part of its activities through preference shares that do not have redemption dates and through debenture stock and secured bonds that were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December 2008 of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: oating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set: xed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due be repaid.
The Companys exposure to oating interest rates on assets is 124,383,000 2007: 88,394,000.
The Companys exposure to xed interest rates on liabilities is 140,087,000 2007: 146,907,000.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2007: same : the finance charge on the preference shares is at a weighted average interest rate of 3.3% 2007: 3.3% : the finance charge on the debenture stock is at a weighted average interest rate of 8.5% 2007: 8.5% : the finance charge on the secured bonds is at a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% 2007: 6.2%.
The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in xed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between oating and xed interest rate changes.
The maximum and minimum amounts subject to interest rate exposures are shown below.
54 14 Financial instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity Based on the Companys monetary financial instruments at each balance sheet date, an increase or decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates would increase or decrease revenue return after tax by 1,791,000 2007: 1,238,000 : capital return after tax by 697,000 2007: 530,000, and total profit after tax and shareholders funds by 2,488,000 2007: 1,768,000.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as investments are made.
14.5 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Board gives guidance to the investment managers as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 December 2008, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, was as follows: 2008 2007 3 months More than 3 months More than or less one year Total or less one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Current liabilities Amounts due to brokers and accruals 4,892 4,892 5,277 5,277 Non current liabilities Preference shares 2,555 2,555 2,555 2,555 Debenture stock 45,779 45,779 45,779 45,779 Secured bonds 91,753 91,753 98,573 98,573 4,892 140,087 144,979 5,277 146,907 152,184 14.6 Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
The recent reduction in the Companys stock lending programme reduces the exposure to counterparty risk.
Management of the risk The risk is managed as follows: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the investment managers, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
None of the Companys financial liabilities are past their due dates or impaired.
55 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 continued 14 Financial instruments continued 14.7 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Except for those financial liabilities measured at amortised cost that are shown below, the fair values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments and derivatives or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value amounts due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, amounts due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank and bank overdrafts.

Note 1 h on page 44 sets out the Boards policy for determining the fair values of the unquoted investments.
The directors are of the opinion that changing one or more of those assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change those fair values signicantly.
The amount of change in fair value for such investments recognised in the profit or loss for the year was a loss of 16,723,000 2007: profit of 7,419,000.
Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern: and to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The Companys policy is to manage the effective gearing in the portfolio to not normally exceed 20%.
Effective gearing is dened to be the total market value of investments less shareholders funds as a percentage of shareholders funds.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Chief Executive Ofcers view on the market: the need to buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium : the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements: the terms of issue of the Companys debenture stock and secured bonds require the aggregate amount outstanding in respect of borrowings, measured in accordance with the policies used to prepare the annual financial statements, not to exceed a sum equal to the Companys capital and reserves at any time: as a public company, the Company has a minimum issued share capital of 50,000: in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividends, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
These requirements are unchanged since the previous year end and the Company has complied with them.

Company law states that investment companies may only distribute accumulated realised profits.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, in its technical guidance TECH 01 08, states that profits arising out of a change in fair value of assets, recognised in accordance with accounting standards, may be distributed, provided the change recognised can be readily converted into cash.
Securities listed on a recognised stock exchange are generally regarded as being readily convertible into cash and hence unrealised profits in respect of such securities, currently included within the unrealised capital reserve, may be regarded as distributable under company law.
This technical interpretation of the meaning of distributable reserves would, as a consequence, give rise at 31 December 2008 to capital reserves available for distribution of approximately 716,756,000 after adjusting for net unrealised capital losses of 141,863,000.
57 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 continued 17 Preference shares Included in non current liabilities is 2,555,000 in respect of issued preference shares as follows: Group and Group and Company Company 2008 2007 000 000 2,055,000 3.4 per cent.
cumulative preference shares of 1 2,055 2,055 500,000 2.7 per cent.
cumulative preference shares of 1 500 500 2,555 2,555 The 3.4 per cent.
cumulative preference shares constitute a single class and confer the right, in priority to any other class of shares: i to receive a xed cumulative preferential dividend at the respective rates exclusive of tax credit thereon of 3.4 per cent.
per annum, such dividend being payable half-yearly on 15 January and 15 July in each year, in respect of the 3.4 per cent.
cumulative preference shares, and on 1 February and 1 August in each year, in respect of the 2.7 per cent.
cumulative preference shares: and ii to receive repayment of capital at par in a winding up of the Company but do not confer any further right to participate in profits or assets.
The preference shareholders are entitled to receive notices of general meetings of the Company but are not entitled to attend or vote thereat except on a resolution for the voluntary liquidation of the Company or for any alteration to the objects of the Company as set out in its Memorandum of Association.
In the event of a poll at a general meeting of the Company, every member of the Company who is present in person or by proxy and who is entitled to vote thereat, whether an ordinary shareholder or, in the circumstances outlined above, a preference shareholder, has one vote for every 1 nominal value of shares registered in their name.
Accordingly, on a poll each ordinary shareholder has one vote for every four shares held.
18 Net asset value per ordinary share The net asset value per ordinary share is based on the net assets attributable to the ordinary shares of 879,247,000 2007: 1,219,306,000 and on the 214,398,654 ordinary shares in issue at 31 December 2008 2007: 223,426,499.
The movements during the year of the net assets attributable to the ordinary shares were as follows: 000 Total net assets at 1 January 2008 1,219,306 Total loss for the year 279,216 Dividends paid in the year on the ordinary shares see note 8 22,137 Buy-backs of ordinary shares 38,706 Net assets attributable to the ordinary shares at 31 December 2008 879,247 An alternative net asset value per ordinary share can be calculated by deducting from the total assets less current liabilities of the Company the preference shares, the debenture stock and the secured bonds at their market or fair values rather than at their par or book values.
Details of the alternative values are set out in note 14.7.
The net asset value per ordinary share at 31 December 2008 calculated on this basis is 400.3p 2007: 537.9p.

Year ended 31 December 2008 Year ended 31 December 2007 Investment Management Investment Management trust services trust services 000 000 000 000 Revenue from external customers 36,996 766 38,334 1,142 Carrying amount of assets 878,206 1,041 1,218,320 986 24 Value Added Tax In 2004 the Association of Investment Companies the AIC, together with JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust plc, launched a case against HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to challenge whether Value Added Tax VAT should have been charged on fees paid for management services provided to investment trust companies.
On 28 June 2007 the European Court of Justice delivered its judgement on the case in favour of the AIC.
Since then HMRC has accepted that the provision of investment management services to investment trust companies is VAT exempt and has acknowledged its liability to pay claims in respect of VAT borne by investment companies.
Henderson Global Investors Limited Henderson, which was the Companys sole investment manager until 2004 and has been one of the Companys investment managers since 2004, has now been able to reclaim from HMRC the amount of VAT charged to the Company in respect of investment management services from 1 October 2000 to 30 June 2007, to the extent that such VAT was borne by the Company.
VAT has not been applied to investment management fees invoiced in respect of periods since June 2007.
Similarly, the Company has been able to recover VAT paid in respect of its other investment management contracts.
Accordingly, 1,450,000 of the VAT borne by the Company on investment management fees invoiced in the period from 1 October 2000 to 30 June 2007 was written back in the year ended 31 December 2007: this was the amount that the Board then considered to be certain of recovery.
The write-back has been allocated between revenue return and capital return according to the allocation of the amounts originally paid.
Since the year end the Company has received back the balance of the 1,450,000 that was outstanding at 31 December 2008.
As a result of the agreement reached by Henderson Global Investors Limited and HMRC, the Company has received back a further 565,000 in respect of the period from 2000 to 2007 and this has been recognised in the Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The total of 2,015,000 to date represents all the VAT borne by the Company in the period from 1 October 2000 to the point in 2007 from which VAT was no longer charged.
The Company may be able to recover further amounts of the VAT charged on investment management fees in the years from 1990 to 2000 inclusive.
For this purpose the years 1990 to 2000 fall into two distinct periods.
The Company expects to be able to reclaim VAT paid in respect of the period from 1 January 1990 to 4 December 1996, following the judgement of the House of Lords in a case concerning the time limits applicable to VAT claims.
The Board considers that the calculation of the gures is currently too uncertain to permit a realistic estimate to be made but it does not expect the amount to be material in the context of the Companys total assets.
There may also be some possibility, albeit remote, of recovering VAT paid in the period from then to 30 September 2000.
60 24 Value Added Tax continued The Company will receive from the Manager the interest to be paid by HMRC on the amounts recovered.
The Board is not yet certain as to how this interest will be calculated but has included a gure of 200,000 in the Income Statement in respect of the 2,015,000 referred to above.
25 Subsequent events a Due primarily to a reduction in the market values of the investments held, the Companys net asset value per ordinary share as at 4 March 2009, calculated to include current year income, was 333.5p per share, a decrease of 18.7% from the net asset value per share as at the balance sheet date.
In accordance with FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date, changes in asset prices after the balance sheet date constitute a non-adjusting event as they do not relate to conditions that existed at the balance sheet date.
Accordingly, it is not appropriate to reect any financial effect of these changes in asset prices in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2008. b On 4 March 2009 the Company purchased for cancellation 1,190,000 of its Debenture Stock and 28,810,000 of its Secured Bonds.
