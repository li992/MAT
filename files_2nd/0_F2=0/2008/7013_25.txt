Borrowing facilities The Groups principal source of long-term funding is its unsecured five-year 165 million revolving credit facility, which expires in February 2013.
Short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts.
These overdraft facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
The Groups indrawn committed facilities available at 29 March 2008 were 105,872,000 of which 6,230,000 mature within one year and 99,642,000 between four and five years.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities As at 29 March 2008 there was no significant difference between the book value and fair value as determined by market value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
Hedging As explained above, the Groups policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward currency contracts.
These instruments are initially recognised at cost, which is typically nil, and subsequently measured at fair value.
Changes in fair value are taken to the Consolidated income statement.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the year end, which all mature within one year: Average Exchange Rate Foreign Currency Contract Value Fair Value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 000 000 US Dollars 1.98 1.95 5,051 6,892 2,550 3,527 11 10 Euros 1.31 1.48 10,069 9,091 7,680 6,138 311 46 Other currencies 1,928 1,891 62 10 12,158 11,556 238 46 With the exception of currency exposures, the disclosures in this note exclude short-term receivables and payables.
