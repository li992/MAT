Accounting policies a Compliance with financial reporting standards The consolidated financial statements the consolidated accounts have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with all relevant International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union IFRS.
I n the current year, the group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the groups financial instruments and management of capital see notes 21 and 30.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, IFRS 8 Operating segments was in issue but not yet effective.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 8 in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group except for additional segmental disclosures when it comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
T he company financial statements the company accounts have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with Section 226 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985 and with all relevant UK accounting standards.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its company income statement and related notes.
b Accounting convention T he consolidated accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss, available for sale financial assets and all derivative financial instruments derivatives.
T he company accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
T he financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the currency of the groups and companys primary operating environment and their functional currency.
c Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries T he consolidated accounts incorporate the financial statements of the company and the entities it controls subsidiaries using the acquisition method of accounting.
Control exists where the company has the power to govern an entitys financial and operating policies.
The results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated income statement from the date control transfers to the company to the date control transfers from the company.
U nder the acquisition method of accounting, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition with the interest of minority shareholders stated at the minoritys proportion of these amounts.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over these net assets is capitalised as goodwill.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated.
As allowed by IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the company has not restated to IFRS fair values those acquisitions that took place before 1 August 2004.
Associates T he consolidated accounts also incorporate the financial statements of entities that are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures but over which the company has significant influence associates, using the equity method of accounting.
Significant influence applies where the company and its subsidiaries the group hold 20% or more of an entitys voting power, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case.
The groups share of an associates results is included in the consolidated income statement from the date it becomes an associate to the date it stops being so.
U nder the equity method of accounting, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost.
This carrying amount subsequently decreases for the groups share of any losses or distributions received and increases for the groups share of any profit.
The carrying amount is also reviewed annually for impairment.
Three colour section : PMS 7463 C text PMS 180 C top panel PMS 9140 C background Close Brothers Annual Report 2008 49 d Net interest income Interest on loans and advances made by the group, and fee income and expense and other direct costs relating to loan origination, restructuring or commitments are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate EIR method.
The EIR method applies a rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts relating to a financial instrument to its net carrying amount.
The cash flows take into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument including transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts but not future credit losses.
e Net fee and commission income W here fees that have not been included within the EIR method are earned on the execution of a significant act, such as fees arising from negotiating or arranging a transaction for a third party, they are recognised as revenue when that act has been completed.
Fees and corresponding expenses in respect of other services are recognised in the income statement as the right to consideration or payment accrues through performance of services.
In particular, upfront commissions paid in respect of managing, as opposed to originating, fund products are initially included within prepayments and accrued income and then recognised as revenue as the services are provided.
To the extent that fees and commissions are recognised in advance of billing they are included as accrued income or expense.
f Gains less losses arising from dealing in securities T his includes the net gains arising from both buying and selling securities and from positions held in securities, including related interest income and dividends.
g Share-based awards T he group operates three long term equity based incentive arrangements Incentive Schemes : the 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme and the Inland Revenue approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
As allowed by IFRS 1, the company has not applied IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to grants under these Incentive Schemes before 8 November 2002.
T he cost of these Incentive Schemes is based on the fair value of awards on the date of grant.
Fair values are determined using a stochastic Monte Carlo simulation pricing model for the LTIP and the Black-Scholes pricing model for the others.
Both models take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
Vesting conditions are not taken into account when measuring fair value, but are reflected by adjusting the number of shares in each award such that the amount recognised reflects the number that are expected to, and then actually do, vest.
The fair value is expensed in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to the share-based awards reserve.
At the end of the vesting period, or upon exercise, lapse or forfeit if earlier, this credit is transferred to retained reserves.
h Depreciation and amortisation P roperty, plant and equipment, including freehold investment properties held for long term investment, and computer software classified as intangible assets other, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortisation, less provisions for any impairment.
The provision for depreciation or amortisation on these assets is calculated to write off their cost over their estimated useful lives by equal annual instalments as follows: Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10% to 33% Motor vehicles 25% Freehold and long leasehold property 2.5% Short leasehold property over the length of the lease Computer software 20% to 33% No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold land, which is stated at cost.
i Impairment losses on goodwill G oodwill arising on the acquisition of business assets before 1 August 1998 has been written off to reserves.
From that date such goodwill arising was capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised, in equal annual instalments, Three colour section : PMS 7463 C text PMS 180 C top panel PMS 9140 C background Financial 50 Statements The Notes 1.
Accounting policies continued unless there has been impairment, over its estimated useful life of up to 20 years.
From 1 August 2004, amortisation of goodwill has ceased, negative goodwill is credited to the income statement and the net book value of goodwill is subject to impairment review at least annually.
j Exceptional items I tems of income and expense that are material by size and or nature and are non-recurring are classified as exceptional items on the face of the income statement.
The separate reporting of these items helps give an indication of the groups underlying performance.
k Current tax C urrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
l Deferred tax T o enable the tax charge to be based on the profit for the year, deferred tax is provided in full on temporary timing differences, at the rates of tax expected to apply when these differences crystallise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be set.
All deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12. m Settlement accounts S ettlement balance debtors and creditors are the amounts due to and from counterparties in respect of the groups market-making activities.
The balances are short term in nature, do not earn interest and are recorded at the amount receivable or payable.
n Loans and advances to customers L oans and advances are recognised when cash is advanced to borrowers at cost including any transaction costs and are classified as loans and receivables under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
They are then amortised using the EIR method and recorded net of provisions for impairment losses.
I mpairment provisions are made if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more subsequent events regarding a significant loan or a portfolio of loans a loan and its impact can be reliably estimated.
T he amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the original EIR.
As the loan amortises over its life, the impairment loss may amortise.
All impairment losses are reviewed at least at each reporting date.
If subsequently the amount of the loss decreases as a result of a new event, the relevant element of the outstanding impairment loss is reversed.
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised at the original EIR applied to the carrying amount as reduced by an allowance for impairment.
F or loans that are not considered individually significant, the group adopts a formulaic approach which allocates a loss rate dependent on the overdue period.
Loss rates are based on the discounted expected future cash flows and are regularly benchmarked against actual outcomes to ensure they remain appropriate.
o Finance leases, operating leases and instalment finance A fi finance lease is a lease or hire purchase contract that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee.
Finance leases are recognised as loans at an amount equal to the gross investment in the lease discounted at its implicit interest rate.
Finance charges on finance leases are taken to income in proportion to the net funds invested.
R ental costs under other leases and hire purchase contracts are charged to the income statement in equal annual amounts over the period of the leases.
Three colour section : PMS 7463 C text PMS 180 C top panel PMS 9140 C background Close Brothers Annual Report 2008 51 p Debt securities and equity shares Fair values of all financial instruments are obtained from independent open market sources, independent professional valuers, discounted cash flow models based on prevailing market rates or option pricing models.
Financial instruments held for trading The long and short positions respectively represent the aggregate net bought and net sold positions, held by Winterflood Securities Limited and Close Brothers Seydler AG.
They are valued at the dealers bid and offer prices respectively and are the only financial instruments held for trading.
As such they are fair valued through profit or loss and the net gains arising are the only items shown within gains and losses arising from dealing in securities in the income statement.
Other investments designated at inception under the fair value option These are equity shares and related loans classified thus because they are managed, and their performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented investment strategy, with results being reported to the companys board.
Resulting gains and losses are included in the income statement within other operating income.
Listed investments are valued at bid price.
Unlisted investments comprise those made by Close Brothers Private Equity LLP and Close Brothers Growth Capital Limited in the limited liability partnerships that they manage.
The partnerships themselves typically invest in unquoted entities via equity and loans and value each investment semi-annually in compliance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines endorsed by The British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, their valuations being externally audited annually.
Each investment is generally valued at cost for the first year: thereafter valuations are typically based on an appropriate multiple of earnings before interest and tax EBIT.
If necessary, the partnerships adjust EBIT, in the latest statutory or management accounts as appropriate, to what are considered sustainable levels based on forecast indicators.
With respect to the multiple, a comparable quoted company, group of companies, sector or recent transaction is used and discounted for differences in size, operation, product mix, timing and marketability.
The groups valuation of the overall portfolio of partnership interests reflects the illiquid nature of the portfolio and the effect of cash distributions and material changes in the business outlook or performance of the individual investments since their last semi-annual valuation.
Floating rate notes held to maturity These are investments with fixed or determinable payments that are held with the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
They are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs and subsequently valued at amortised cost.
Amortised cost is the initial amount adjusted for subsequent payments, less cumulative amortisation calculated using the EIR method.
The resulting balance is reduced for amounts which are considered to be impaired or uncollectible.
Financial instruments classified as available for sale These are recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable purchase costs, with changes being accounted for through equity.
If such an asset is sold or there is objective evidence that it is impaired, the cumulative gains and losses recognised in equity are recycled to the income statement.
Certificates of deposit classified as loans and receivables under IAS 39 These are purchased for liquidity purposes and normally held to maturity.
They are unlisted and due to mature within one year and are valued at amortised cost.
Equity shares held by the employee benefit trust These are held at cost and shown within equity as part of Share-based reserves.
Realised surpluses and deficits are not taken to the income statement.
q Loans to and from money brokers against stock advanced D eposits with money brokers and banks against stock borrowed are the cash collateral provided to these institutions for stock borrowing by the groups market-making activities.
Interest is paid on the stock borrowed and earned on the cash deposits held.
The stock borrowing to which the cash deposits relate is short term in nature and is recorded at the amount payable.
Loans from financial institutions against stock advanced are the equivalent cash liabilities and are accounted for in the same way.
r Derivatives and hedge accounting Derivatives are used only to minimise the impact of interest and currency rate changes to the groups financial instruments and meet the IAS 39 criteria for hedge accounting.
They are carried on the balance sheet at fair value Three colour section : PMS 7463 C text PMS 180 C top panel PMS 9140 C background Financial 52 Statements The Notes 1.
Accounting policies continued which is obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, including recent market transactions, and discounted cash flow models.
On acquisition, a derivative is designated as a hedge and the group formally documents the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item.
The group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
If a hedge was deemed wholly or partially ineffective, the amount of the ineffectiveness, taking into account the timing of the expected cash flows where relevant, would be recorded in the income statement.
For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value are recognised in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
For cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective proportion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially directly in equity and recycled to the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects income.
s Foreign currencies For the company and those subsidiaries whose balance sheets are denominated in sterling, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange over the year and exchange differences arising are taken to the income statement.
The balance sheets of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing rates.
The income statements for these subsidiaries are translated at the average rates and exchange differences arising are taken to the exchange movements reserve.
As allowed by IFRS 1, cumulative foreign exchange differences up to 31 July 2004 have not been recognised in the exchange movements reserve.
t Dividends Dividends payable are recognised in retained earnings once they are appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the company.
Dividends receivable are recognised once the right to receive payment is established.
u Pensions A defined contribution scheme is a pension arrangement where the group pays fixed contributions into a fund separate from the groups assets.
Contributions are charged in the income statement when they become payable.
A defined benefit scheme is an arrangement where an employees retirement receipts are defined by factors such as salary, length of service and age.
The liabilities of the groups one defined benefit scheme, which was closed to new entrants in 1996, are measured using the projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate that reflects the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds with a term that matches that of the liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the income statement over the members expected average remaining working lives.
The net deficit or surplus on the plan, comprising the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets, is carried on the balance sheet.
v Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.
Segmental analysis The directors manage the group primarily by class of business and present the segmental analysis on that basis.
The groups activities are organised in four primary divisions namely Asset Management, Banking, Corporate Finance and Securities.
A description of the activities of these divisions is given in the Business Review.
Divisions charge market prices for services rendered to other parts of the group.
Funding charges between segments are determined by the Banking divisions treasury operation having regard to commercial demands.
Substantially all of the groups activities and revenue are located within the British Isles.

Earnings per share Earnings per share is presented on four bases: basic: diluted: adjusted basic: and adjusted diluted.
Basic earnings per share is in respect of all activities and diluted earnings per share takes into account the dilution effects which would arise on the conversion or vesting of share options and share awards in issue during the period.
Adjusted basic earnings per share excludes exceptional items and impairment losses on goodwill to enable comparison of the underlying earnings of the business with prior periods and adjusted diluted earnings per share takes into account the same dilution effects as for diluted earnings per share described above.

Intangible asset: goodwill Net book value million At 1 August 2007 including 163.3 million of original capitalised cost 113.2 Goodwill arising from acquisition of subsidiaries 8.8 Goodwill arising from purchases of minority interests and other movements 4.8 Impairment losses At 31 July 2008 126.8 Cumulative goodwill arising from acquisitions before 1 August 1998, of 81.9 million 2007: 81.9 million was, and remains, written off directly to reserves.
The relevant constituent of this goodwill would be charged or credited to the profit and loss account should the related acquisition be sold.
All balance sheet goodwill is allocated to individual cash generating units CGUs, which are all at a lower level than our four operating divisions.
There are no CGUs in which the goodwill carrying amount is significant in comparison with total goodwill.
All goodwill impairment reviews, which are carried out at least annually at operating division level and then reviewed centrally, were based on CGU cash flows using the most recent budgets, three year plan and forecast and took account of past experience.
Generally, differing key assumptions on impacting factors and uncertainties are applied to each CGU but where the recoverable amounts of two or more CGUs are based on the same key assumptions, their related aggregate goodwill carrying amount is still not significant in comparison with total goodwill.
Projections were no more than seven years ahead with projected rates falling significantly in later years due to their uncertainty.
Management does not believe that a change in assumptions would cause the aggregate goodwill carrying amounts to exceed their aggregate recoverable amounts, without the change being accompanied by a significant loss event.

Capital management Our policy has always been to be well capitalised and soundly financed whilst nonetheless maximising our return on capital.
Our approach to capital management is driven by strategy and organisational requirements, while also taking into account the regulatory and commercial environments in which we operate.
We believe our strong capital position is a core strength in the current market environment and leaves us well positioned to take advantage of organic and acquisition growth opportunities.
We also seek to maintain a prudent balance between the advantages and flexibility afforded by a strong capital position and the higher returns on equity that are possible with greater leverage.
In addition to maintaining our strong capital base to support the development of the business it is also important to ensure we meet regulatory capital requirements at all times, as well as maintaining an adequate level of capital in our rated subsidiary, CBL, as determined by rating targets.
We would therefore expect to have capital adequacy ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements even before taking account of the need to fund our non regulated activities and small acquisitions.
The board considers both the overall group and each divisions capital position and requirements on a regular basis and after taking into account each divisions regulatory and operational requirements, excess capital is transferred to group every six months by way of dividend.
The Financial Services Authority FSA supervises the group on a consolidated basis and receives information on the capital adequacy of, and sets capital requirements for, the group as a whole.
In addition a number of subsidiaries are directly regulated by the FSA.
We completed our transition to Basel II during the year.
As expected there was no major impact on our regulatory capital requirement from the transition.
The aim of Basel II is to promote safety and soundness in the financial system.
It is structured around three pillars: Pillar 1 on minimum capital requirements: Pillar 2 on the supervisory review process: and Pillar 3 on market discipline.
Our Pillar 1 information is presented in the table on the next page.
Under Pillar 2, we have completed a self assessment of risks not captured by Pillar 1 in a process known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process.
This has been reviewed by the FSA and the process culminated in the FSA providing Individual Capital Guidance on the level of capital we are required to hold.
Pillar 3 aims to encourage market discipline by developing a set of disclosure requirements which will allow market participants to assess key pieces of information on a firms capital, risk exposures and risk assessment process.
We will provide the required Pillar 3 disclosures on our website by December 2008.
Total regulatory capital under Basel II reduced by 88.5 million during the year to 613.6 million.
Whilst we had retained earnings of 90.0 million, this was more than offset by shareholder distributions of 92.7 million, including the special dividend declared in 2007.
Our regulatory capital was further reduced by 49.7 million as a result of our investment in associates, principally Mako, and by 16.0 million as a result of investment in our own shares to hedge share based award schemes.
Notional risk weighted assets increased by 354.5 million to 3,804.0 million, principally as a result of growth in the loan book and cash and cash equivalents.

Defined benefits pension scheme The groups only defined benefits pension scheme the scheme was closed to new entrants in August 1996.
At 31 July 2008 this scheme had 23 2007: 27 active members, 73 2007: 77 deferred members and 12 2007: four pensioners.
The remainder of this note relates exclusively to the scheme.
Contributions to the scheme have been determined by an independent qualified actuary based on triennial valuations using the attained age method.
The most recent such valuation was at 31 July 2006, when the agreed company contribution rate was 29.5% per annum of pensionable salaries.
Future contributions to be made by the participating group companies under actuarial advice should meet all pension obligations.
The valuation was based upon the following annual financial assumptions: 2008 2007 2006 % % % Inflation 3.8 3.1 2.8 Increase in: Salaries 2.0 2.0 2.0 Pension in payment 3.8 3.1 2.8 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 6.4 5.8 5.5 Expected return on the schemes assets: Equities 8.7 8.0 7.8 Fixed interest gilts 5.1 5.2 4.6 Cash 5.1 4.9 4.2 The net surplus deficit of the scheme disclosed below has been accounted for as an asset liability of the group: 2008 2007 2006 million million million Equities 15.2 19.3 16.9 Bonds 4.4 3.5 3.4 Cash 3.3 1.1 1.3 Total market value of scheme assets 22.9 23.9 21.6 Present value of scheme liabilities 24.4 23.3 21.4 Deficit surplus before tax 1.5 0.6 0.2 Related deferred tax liability asset 0.4 0.2 Net deficit surplus 1.1 0.4 0.2 2008 2007 Charge Charge credit Pension credit to the group scheme to the group Pension income deficit income scheme statement surplus statement surplus million million million million Opening surplus before tax 0.6 0.2 Expected return on scheme assets 1.8 1.5 Expected return on scheme liabilities 1.3 1.2 C u rrent service cost 1.1 0.6 Charge to the income statement 0.6 0.3 Contributions 1.1 0.9 Net actuarial loss 2.6 0.2 Closing deficit surplus before tax 1.5 0.6 Three colour section : PMS 7463 C text PMS 180 C top panel PMS 9140 C background Close Brothers Annual Report 2008 73 27.

Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires the directors to exercise judgement in the process of applying the groups accounting policies.
Estimates and judgements are kept under continuous evaluation and are based mainly on historical experience and expectations of future events but incorporate other factors.
The following are areas which involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity or where assumptions are significant to the financial statements.
Judgements Financial instrument designations and impairment Judgement is required both in ascertaining within which category, as prescribed in IAS 39, a financial instrument should be initially designated as well as in determining whether it has been impaired.
Qualifying hedge relationships In designating a financial instrument as part of a qualifying hedge relationship, the directors have determined that the hedge is expected to be highly effective over the life of the hedging instrument.
In accounting for a derivative as a cash flow hedge, the directors have determined that the future cash flows of the hedged exposure are highly probable.
Estimates Fair value of debt securities For debt securities carried at fair value, the method for calculating fair value is described in note 1 p on page 51.
Effective interest rate At least annually, models are reviewed to assess expected lives of groups of assets based upon actual repayment profiles.
Loan impairment The directors review loans for impairment at least annually.
The factors considered in determining whether assets are impaired are outlined in the accounting policies in note 1 n on page 50.
Defined benefit obligations The value of the obligations of the defined benefit scheme is calculated by the schemes actuaries using the assumptions set out in note 26 on page 72.
Provisions Provisions are carried in respect of certain known or forecast future expenditure, as described in note 14 on page 62.
Financial risk management As a diversified group of financial services businesses, financial instruments are central to the groups activities.
The risks associated with financial instruments represent a significant component of the risks faced by the group and are analysed in more detail below.
The groups financial risk management objectives are summarised in the Risk Management section of the Business Review on pages 18 to 20.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 1 to the financial statements.

The quality and level of security are demonstrated by the corresponding levels of historic loan impairment losses which for the last five years have not exceeded 1.5% of the average net loan book.
The group has securitised 172 million 2007: 156 million of its loans and advances to customers with Cruise Limited Cruise in return for non-refundable finance of 165 million 2007: 150 million.
If the receipts from the loans and advances to customers exceed interest and principal loan liabilities due to Cruise, the surplus is due to the group.
Should there be a shortfall the group is not obliged, and does not intend, to support any losses and the providers of the funding have agreed to this.
The group has the option to replace these securitised loans as they are repaid and to increase the amount of securitised loans and advances to 200 million.
At 31 July 2008 the balance sheet of Cruise comprised principally insurance premium loans ands advances to customers of 172 million 2007: 156 million and borrowings of 165 million 2007: 150 million.
The profit and loss account, other recognised gains and losses and cash flows of Cruise are negligible.
The group has entered into a repurchase agreement whereby floating rate notes to the value of 104.9 million have been lent in exchange for cash of 98.0 million.
The agreement matures within the next six months.
These floating rate notes remain on the groups balance sheet and the group retains the risk and rewards of ownership.
Loans to money brokers against stock advanced are the cash collateral provided to these institutions for stock borrowing by the groups market making activities.
The groups accounting policy in respect of these financial assets is further described in Note 1 q on page 51.

The amount of interest income accrued on impaired loans and advances was 6.1 million 2007: 5.4 million.
Whilst collateral is reviewed on a regular basis in accordance with credit policy, this varies according to the type of lending and collateral involved.
It is therefore impracticable to estimate and aggregate current fair values for collateral.
Concentration and quality of financial assets The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics if they are connected entities.
The loan book is well spread, short term, secured and with a low average loan size in order to avoid concentration risk.
The credit quality of our counterparties with whom we place deposits or whose certificates of deposit or floating rate notes we buy are monitored by the Treasury Committee which establishes specific limits.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Three colour section : PMS 7463 C text PMS 180 C top panel PMS 9140 C background Close Brothers Annual Report 2008 81 Market risk Interest rate risk The groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to the returns from its capital and reserves which, as a matter of policy, are not hedged.
The group has a policy of broadly matching interest rate liabilities on its loans and advances to customers whereby variable rate financing is swapped into fixed rate financing to secure the margin on those loans and advances.
These interest rate swaps are disclosed in note 16 on page 63.
The sensitivities below are based upon reasonably possible changes in interest rate scenarios, including parallel shifts in the yield curve.
At 31 July 2008 a 1.25% increase or decrease in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups annual net interest income by the following amounts, prior to mitigation: 2008 2007 million million 1.25% increase 1.7 2.7 1.25% decrease 1.7 2.7 At 31 July 2008 a 1.25% increase or decrease in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups equity by the following amounts, prior to mitigation: 2008 2007 million million 1.25% increase 1.2 1.9 1.25% decrease 1.2 1.9 Foreign currency risk The group has a number of currency investments in subsidiaries and associates and has chosen not to hedge those exposures.
These investments are predominantly in US dollars and euros.
In the event of a 10% strengthening in the value of sterling against all currencies the groups equity would decrease by 13 million 2007: 4 million.
For a 10% weakening in sterling there would be an equal and opposite impact on the groups equity.
Other than the above the groups exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal and as such the impact of any reasonably possibly exchange rate fluctuations would not be material.
Nonetheless the group does use exchange rate contracts to mitigate the existing risk and details of those contracts are disclosed in note 16 on page 63.

The average exposure has been calculated on a daily basis.
The highest and lowest exposures occurred on different dates and therefore a net position of these exposures does not reflect a spread of the trading book.
The basis on which the trading book is valued each day is given in the accounting policies in note 1 p on page 51.
Based upon the trading book exposure given above, a hypothetical fall of 10% in market prices would result in a 2.4 million 2007: 3.6 million decrease in the groups income and net assets on the equity trading book and a 3.7 million 2007: 1.3 million decrease in the debt securities trading book.
However, the groups trading activity is mainly a jobbing business where positions are managed throughout the day on a continuous basis.
Accordingly the result shown above is purely hypothetical.
