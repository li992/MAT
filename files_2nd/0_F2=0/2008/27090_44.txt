NOTES TO ACCOUNTS 20 Contingent Liabilities, Guarantees and Financial Commitments At 30 April 2008 the Company had a contingent liability of 13,500,000 2007 13,500,000 in respect of a subscription agreement relating to participating loan notes which expire on 31 December 2010.
21 Recoverable VAT In 2004 the Association of Investment Companies the AIC, together with JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust, launched a case against HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to challenge whether Value Added Tax VAT should be charged on investment management fees.
In June 2007 the European Court of Justice found in favour of the AIC.
Since then HMRC has accepted that management fees should be exempt from VAT and has acknowledged its liability to pay claims in respect of VAT borne by investment companies.
No VAT has been charged on management fees since July 2007 and the Managers have submitted repayment claims to HMRC for the periods from 2000 to 2007 and from 1990 to 1996.
The Board is satis ed that at least 1,164,000 is certain to be recovered by the Managers on behalf of the Company in respect of the period 2000 to 2007 and therefore this amount has been recognised in the current year.
The Board, however, considers that there are too many uncertainties to allow any reasonable estimate of any further amounts potentially recoverable over both periods.
The Company will receive from the Managers any interest paid by HMRC on the amounts eventually recovered.
22 Related Party Transactions The Directors fees for the year are detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 24.
No Director has a contract of service with the Company.
During the year no Director was interested in any contract or other matter requiring disclosure under section 232 of the Companies Act 1985 other than as disclosed in note 3.
The details of the management fee are set out in note 3, and the management fee due to Baillie Gifford as at 30 April 2008 is disclosed in note 11.
23 Financial Instruments As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and makes other investments so as to secure its investment objective of capital growth.
The Company borrows money when the Board and Managers have suf cient conviction that the assets funded by borrowed monies will generate a return in excess of the cost of borrowing.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that cause short term variation in the Companys net assets and could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the pro ts available for dividend.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent reduction in the Companys net assets rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value or future cash ows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may uctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Manager both assesses the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitors the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown in note 9.
Details of derivative financial instruments outstanding at the balance sheet date are shown on page 42.
Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Manager assesses the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the currency in which a companys share price is quoted is not necessarily the one in which it earns its pro ts.
The movement in exchange rates on overseas earnings may have a more signi cant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the share price of the company is quoted.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts are used periodically to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Where appropriate, they are used also to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the Company in meeting its investment objectives.
38 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 NOTES TO ACCOUNTS 23 Financial Instruments continued Currency Risk continued Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation, which is calculated by reference to the currency in which the asset or liability is quoted, is shown below.
The main changes to net currency exposure during the year have been higher exposure to the euro and other European currencies partly through investment in European equities and bonds and partly due to moving cash deposits from sterling, as explained in further detail in the Chairmans Statement and Managers Portfolio Review on pages 4 to 8.
Currency Risk Sensitivity At 30 April 2008, if sterling had strengthened by 5% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
A 5% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2007.

Interest rate movements may also impact upon the market value of the Companys investments other than its xed income securities.
The effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a signi cant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash ows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and xed income securities and the income receivable on cash deposits, oating rate notes and other similar investments.
The Company nances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
THE MONKS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 39 NOTES TO ACCOUNTS 23 Financial Instruments continued Interest Rate Risk continued Movements in interest rates, to the extent that they affect the fair value of the Companys xed rate borrowings, may also affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value assuming that the Companys share price is unaffected by movements in interest rates.
The interest rate risk pro le of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 30 April is shown below.

The Company also invested 22.7 million in xed rate UK bonds but the exposure of these bonds to a general rise in yields was hedged by selling a gilt future see footnote below for further details.
The fair value of the xed rate UK bonds excludes the fair value of the Liffe long gilt future sale see page 42.
The fair value of the future of 526,000 represents the difference between the contracted sale value on the trade of 20,127,000 and the equivalent notional amount at the year end of 19,601,000.
The purpose of the gilt future is to hedge the Companys sterling denominated xed rate investment grade bonds against the risk of a general rise in yields by selling a gilt future, thereby limiting its interest rate risk on its UK xed rate bonds to the change in spread between investment grade bonds and gilts.
The Companys net risk exposure at 30 April 2008 of its UK xed rate bonds, after adjustment for the notional amount of the gilt future sale is therefore 2,766,000.
This instrument comprises a zero coupon note issued by Credit Suisse and an option on sterling interest rate swaps.
The zero coupon element has a redemption value of 15 million fair value 11.4 million and the redemption value of the interest rate swap element fair value 8.8 million is based on a formula linked to thirty year sterling interest swap rates with higher amounts payable as rates rise.
Prior to redemption, the value of the interest rate swap element will vary depending on several factors such as the level of swap rates and the implied volatility of interest rate swap options.

40 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 NOTES TO ACCOUNTS 23 Financial Instruments continued Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 30 April 2008 would have increased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 13,836,000 2007 11,912,000 and would have increased the net asset value per share with debentures at fair value by 7.2p 2007 6.3p.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 5,444,000 2007 3,757,000 and would have decreased net asset value per share with debentures at fair value by 4.1p 2007 3.4p.
Other Price Risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objective and investment policy.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity A full list of the Companys investments is shown on pages 12 to 16.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the portfolio by broad industrial or commercial sector and a list of the 30 largest equity investments are contained in the Managers Portfolio Review section.
86.3% of the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities.
A 5% increase in quoted equity valuations at 30 April 2008 would have increased total assets and total return on ordinary activities by 44,478,000 2007 47,227,000.
A decrease of 5% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter dif culty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is not signi cant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Board also sets parameters for the degree to which the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities.
The Company has the power to take out borrowings, which give it access to additional funding when required.
The Companys borrowing facilities are detailed in note 12. Credit Risk This is the risk that a failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
This risk is managed as follows: where the Investment Manager makes an investment in a bond or other security with credit risk, that credit risk is assessed a nd then compared to the prospective investment return of the security in question: the Companys listed investments are held on its behalf by Bank of New York Mellon, the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports and reporting its findings to the Board.
investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Investment Manager.
Transactions are ordinarily done on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transaction entered into by the Company has delivered on its obligations before any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed: the credit worthiness of the counterparty to transactions involving derivatives, structured notes and other arrangements, whe rein the creditworthiness of the entity acting as broker or counterparty to the transaction is likely to be of sustained interest, are subject to rigorous assessment by the Investment Manager: and cash is only held at banks that have been identi ed by the Managers as reputable and of high credit quality.
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities The Directors are of the opinion that the financial assets and liabilities of the Company are stated at fair value in the balance sheet with the exception of the long term borrowings which are stated at amortised cost in accordance with FRS 26.
