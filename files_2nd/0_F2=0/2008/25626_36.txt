Goodwill continued The key assumptions used in value in use calculations were: The budgeted trading profit growth: management determines budgeted trading profit based on past experience and its expectation for the market development.
The budgeted IBA interest income growth: this is based on past experience and long-term interest rates projections.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segment and country of operation.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with long-term economic forecasts in the countries of operation.
"Impairment: During 2007 an impairment loss of 3,400,000 was recognised in respect of the goodwill attributable to the Latin American CGU which is included in the ""Americas"" disclosure noted above."
The impairment arose as a result of the loss of a significant business portfolio in the Group's Mexican operations.
The recoverable amount of the unit containing the related goodwill was determined based on value in use calculations using a discount rate of 16.1%.
