Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year but adjusted for the effects of dilutive options.

The most significant elements of the groups total consolidated goodwill of 342.6m at 31 December 2008 are allocated to PANalytical 105.9m, BTG 63.8m, HBM 71.9m and Brel & Kjr Sound & Vibration 62.2m.
Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
There have been no indications of impairment in 2008.
As part of the annual impairment test review, the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each cash-generating unit based on actual operating results and the most recent budgets for the next financial year.
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections are based relate to growth rates and discount rates.
There are no individually significant assumptions in respect of any business that materially impacts the impairment testing.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the budgets do not exceed 2.5%.
The cash flow projections have been discounted on the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital estimated at 13%.
No impairment charge has been recognised in either 2008 or 2007 to write goodwill down to its estimated recoverable amount.
The directors have considered the following individual sensitivities: a 2% increase in the pre-tax discount rate to 15% would result in an impairment of 6.0m: if the long-term growth rate assumption was reduced to 1% no impairment would arise: and if the cash flow projections of all businesses were reduced by 25% in 2009 and 2010 no impairment would arise.
The goodwill impairment testing performed by management is based on plan data updated in February 2009.

After the year end, a 50m, five-year term facility was secured from the European Investment Bank in January 2009 under covenant conditions in line with existing facilities.
Secured bank loans Bank loans are secured by fixed charges over property at three of the groups subsidiaries.
Of these 2.0m is denominated in Chinese renminbi and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a fixed interest rate of 7.5%, 0.7m is denominated in US dollars and is repayable by instalments until December 2014 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin, and 0.4m is denominated in euros and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin.
Unsecured loan notes The interest rates on the unsecured loan notes are those contracted on the underlying borrowings before taking into account any cross-currency interest rate swaps, and remain fixed until redemption.
On issue of the US$100m loan notes in October 2003 the group entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap which has the effect of converting this US dollar borrowing into fixed interest euro-denominated debt.
The combined effect of the borrowing and swap arrangement results in euro debt of 90.5m with a fixed interest rate of 5.64%.
This interest rate remains fixed until redemption.

Borrowings continued Under adopted IFRS, where cross-currency interest rate swaps are used, the value of the underlying US dollar borrowing is presented in this borrowings note and the value of the related cross-currency interest rate swaps is presented separately within derivative financial instruments in Note 21.
For management purposes, the value attributed to the portion of the swap arrangements that converts US dollar borrowings into euro borrowings is viewed as part of the groups net debt, as analysed below.

The fair value of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using approporiate yield curves, to the net present values.

These contracts mature in the next 12 months, therefore the cash flows and resulting effect on profit and loss are expected to occur within the next 12 months.

Under adopted IFRS, the underlying US dollar borrowings are required to be presented separately in the balance sheet from the cross-currency interest rate swaps.
In addition, the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is required to be recognised in full on the balance sheet.
The table below shows the movements in the total value of the cross-currency interest rate swap during the year and also how it is attributed to its currency and interest portions.

However, the interest portion of the swap is ineffective in this hedging relationship.
Accordingly, the change in value of the currency portion of the swap is recognised together with the change in value of the underlying US dollar borrowings in reserves, and the change in value of the interest portion of the swap is recognised in the income statement within financing costs.

Provisions are discounted to reflect the time value of money where the effect is significant, generally only where it is anticipated that a liability will crystallise in more than one year.
Reorganisation Reorganisation provisions relate to committed restructuring plans in place within the business and represent the directors best estimate of the cost to complete the restructuring.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the groups standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period, with the occasional extension up to 36 months.
These extended warranties are not significant and the provision represents the directors best estimate of the groups liability based on past experience.
Other Other comprises legal, property-related and other provisions.
Property-related and other provisions represent the directors best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations over varying time periods.
The company has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain pending the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations, but is expected to be within one to three years.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.
Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified but the directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be resisted successfully and therefore the possibility of any outflow in settlement is assessed as remote.

The nature and purpose of other reserves forming part of equity are as follows: Translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges.
Hedging reserve This reserve records the cumulative net change in the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated as effective cash flow hedge relationships.
Merger reserve This reserve arose on the acquisition of Servomex Limited in 1999, a purchase satisfied substantially by the issue of share capital and therefore eligible for merger relief under the provisions of section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve records the historical repurchase of the groups own shares.

For executives and senior managers of the groups operating companies, the performance criteria is subject to EPS in respect of 50% of the award and operating company targets in respect of 50% of the award.

Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust The own shares reserve forms part of retained earnings and represents the cost of shares in Spectris plc purchased in the market and held by the Spectris plc Employee Benefit Trust EBT to satisfy options under the groups share option schemes see Note 27.
2008 2007 m m At 1 January 0.2 0.3 Disposals 0.1 0.1 At 31 December 0.1 0.2 The EBT holds ordinary 5p shares in Spectris plc for the purpose of satisfying obligations under the 1996 Executive Share Option Plan for the benefit of the groups employees.
The market value of the EBTs shares at 31 December 2008 was 0.1m 2007: 0.1m.
The purchase of the shares on the open market is funded by loans directly from Spectris plc.

Acquisitions During the period, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Viscotek Corporation effective on 1 January 2008, nCode International effective on 1 August 2008 and the LDS Test and Measurement business effective on 1 December 2008.
The group also acquired the assets and liabilities of Siemens Machine Vision Business on 19 September 2008 and, in addition, a number of distributors in markets where a direct presence was sought.
The assets and liabilities acquired, together with the aggregate purchase consideration, is summarised below.
The profit contribution of the acquired businesses to the groups result for the period was 3.4m.
Group revenue and operating profit would have been 833.1m and 116.8m respectively had the acquisitions taken place on the first day of the year.
Fair values attached to certain provisions acquired in connection with the LDS business are provisional at the balance sheet date, pending finalisation of the alignment with group policy.
No material changes are anticipated.
Reflecting the proximity of the LDS acquisition to the year end, the allocation of the residual balance of goodwill between goodwill and the fair value of intangible assets is yet to be finalised.
Where the fair value of acquired intangible assets has been identified, the residual goodwill represents the synergies that can be achieved through the integration into the group, the future potential to develop new technology, and the potential future relationships and contracts.
