Retirement benefit obligations a Pension schemes defined benefit Prior to 16 July 2007 certain of the Groups employees were members of two funded defined benefit pension schemes operated by Provident Financial plc.
As part of the demerger, it was agreed that the companies and employees of the new International Personal Finance plc group the Group would continue to participate in the Provident Financial plc pension scheme arrangements until 31 December 2007.
On 1 January 2008, the Group set up a new funded defined benefit scheme for those individuals who had previously been members of the schemes operated by Provident Financial plc.
As part of the demerger agreement, the liabilities relating to the past and present employees of the Group were transferred from the Provident Financial plc schemes to the new scheme together with an agreed amount of assets.
The amount of assets transferred was equal to the value of liabilities on 16 July 2007 adjusted to allow for subsequent investment returns and cash flows plus 3.5m.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value at 31 December 2008.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2008 2007 Group and Company % % Price inflation 2.9 3.4 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.4 5.0 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.9 3.4 Discount rate 6.2 5.7 Long-term rate of return: equities 7.1 7.9 bonds 6.7 4.7 index-linked gilts 3.6 4.3 other 4.5 overall weighted average 6.2 6.3 The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity and property investments reflect long-term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
Different assumptions are used for different groups of members.
Most members have not yet retired.
On average, we expect a male retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 23 years.
On average, we expect a female retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 26 years.
If assumed life expectancies had been assumed to be one year greater for all members, the charge to the income statement would have increased by 0.1m and the present value of defined benefit obligations would have increased by approximately 0.8m.
