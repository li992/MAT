Consistent with the treatment in prior years, the Yes Car Credit operation has been classified as part of continuing operations on the basis that revenue and impairment will continue to be generated from the loan book until it has been fully collected-out.
Revenue between business segments is not material.
All of the groups continuing operations operate in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
A geographic analysis of revenue and profit before taxation of the international business up until the demerger on 16 July 2007 is provided in note 6.

The impact of this is an increase in the notional allocation of group borrowings to the Consumer Credit Division of 66.7m 2007: 188.5m and an increase in the notional cash allocated to central activities of the same amount.
The intragroup elimination adjustment removes this notional allocation to state borrowings and cash on a consolidated group basis.

The Section 75 pension contribution represented a reduction in consideration for the payment of 3.4m of pension contributions into the groups defined benefit pension schemes by the insurance business following disposal.
The groups retirement benefit asset increased by a corresponding amount see note 19.
Disposal costs of 8.1m comprised professional fees and the cost of bonuses for the senior management team of the insurance business.
The tax recovered from the purchaser of 2.0m represented an adjustment to the consideration to reflect tax relief obtained by the purchaser.
The retirement benefit curtailment credit of 2.9m arose as a result of the reduction in the groups projected defined benefit obligation following the insurance business employees ceasing to be active members of the groups pension schemes see note 19.
The share-based payment charge of 0.6m represented the crystallisation of the share options of the insurance business management team as a result of the disposal see note 26.
A deferred tax liability of 1.9m was recognised on the pension curtailment credit and the Section 75 pension contribution.
No tax liability arose on the disposal of the insurance business due to the availability of the Substantial Shareholdings Exemption.

Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008 Provident Financial plc Financial StatementS Notes to the financial statements continued 96 7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding own shares held, which are treated, for this purpose, as being cancelled.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
For share options and awards, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options and awards.

In addition, in order to show the EPS generated from the groups underlying operations, the directors have elected to restate central costs from 6.5m to 4.0m in 2007 to reflect the assumed cost of running the central corporate function following demerger.

All subsequent dividends have been based on the shares in issue following the share consolidation.
The directors are recommending a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2008 of 38.1p per share which will amount to a dividend payment of 50.1m.
If approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting on 6 May 2009, this dividend will be paid on 19 June 2009 to shareholders who are on the register of members at 15 May 2009.
This dividend is not reflected in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2008 as it is subject to shareholder approval.

The average effective interest rate for the year ended 31 December 2008 was 100% for the Consumer Credit Division 2007: 99%, 38% for Vanquis Bank 2007: 38% and 21% for Yes Car Credit 2007: 20%.
The average period to maturity of the amounts receivable from customers within the Consumer Credit Division is 6.5 months 2007: 6.2 months and within Yes Car Credit is 4.1 months 2007: 8.5 months.
Within Vanquis Bank, there is no fixed term for repayment of credit card loans other than a general requirement for customers to make a monthly minimum repayment towards their outstanding balance.
For the majority of customers, this is the higher of 5 or 4.5% of their outstanding balance.
The fair value of amounts receivable from customers is approximately 1.3 billion 2007: 1.1 billion.
Fair value has been derived by discounting expected future cash flows net of collection costs at the groups weighted average cost of capital at the balance sheet date.
This value approximates to market value.
The credit quality of amounts receivable from customers is as follows: Group 2008 2007 Credit quality of amounts receivable from customers m m Neither past due nor impaired 504.7 412.6 Past due but not impaired 113.8 111.9 Impaired 444.8 400.9 Total 1,063.3 925.4 Past due but not impaired balances all relate to home credit loans within the Consumer Credit Division.
There are no accounts loans within Vanquis Bank, Yes Car Credit and the unsecured direct repayment loans business of the Consumer Credit Division which are past due but not impaired.
In the home credit business of the Consumer Credit Division, past due but not impaired balances relate to loans which are contractually overdue.
However, contractually overdue loans are not deemed to be impaired unless the customer has missed two or more cumulative weekly payments in the previous 12-week period since only at this point do the expected future cash flows from loans deteriorate significantly.

In the event of default by the customer, the proceeds from disposal of the motor vehicle originally financed are used to offset amounts due from the customer.
Impairment in Vanquis Bank is deducted from the carrying value of amounts receivable from customers by the use of an allowance account.

2001 and 2003 private placement loan notes The group and company have put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest of the 2001 and 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes into fixed rate sterling liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps match the underlying loan notes see note 22 d. These swaps were designated and were effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges in the year ended 31 December 2008 and the fair value movements in the swaps and the corresponding exchange movements on the underlying loan notes have been deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The cross-currency swaps used to hedge the 2001 US dollar private placement loan notes have a weighted average interest rate of 7.6% 2007: 7.7%, a range of interest rates of 7.6% 2007: 7.6% to 7.7% and a weighted average period to maturity of 2.4 years 2007: 1.2 years.

2004 private placement loan notes The group has put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest of the US dollar private placement loan notes issued in 2004 into floating rate sterling interest liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps match the underlying loan notes see note 22 d. The swaps comprise both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges.
The cash flow hedge portion of the swaps were designated and were effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges in the year and the movements in the swaps and the exchange movements in the underlying loan notes have been deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The fair value hedge portion of the swaps were designated and were effective under IAS 39 as fair value hedges during the year.
As a result, fair value movements in the swaps were charged credited to the income statement with a corresponding entry made to the underlying loan notes within borrowings for the effective portion of the swaps, leaving a net charge credit within the income statement reflecting the net fair value loss gain on the fair value hedge in the year.
The swaps have a range of interest rates from LIBOR 1.58% to LIBOR 1.63% 2007: LIBOR 1.58% to LIBOR 1.63% and a weighted average period to maturity of 4.7 years 2007: 5.7 years.

Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008 Provident Financial plc Financial StatementS Notes to the financial statements continued 114 19 Retirement benefit asset a Pension schemes defined benefit The group has historically operated two major defined benefit schemes: the Provident Financial Senior Pension Scheme the senior pension scheme and the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme the staff pension scheme.
On 1 September 2008, the senior pension scheme was merged into the staff pension scheme, and the group now operates one major defined benefit scheme: the staff pension scheme.
The scheme covers 67% of employees with company-provided pension arrangements and is of the funded, defined benefit type providing retirement benefits based on final salary.
Following a full group review of pension scheme arrangements, from 1 April 2006 members were provided with a choice of paying higher member contributions to continue accruing benefits based on final salary or paying a lower member contribution and accruing benefits based on a percentage of salary which would be revalued each year.
The most recent actuarial valuation of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out as at 1June 2006 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits has been based on the results of this valuation which has been updated by the actuary to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at the balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the balance sheet date.
The net retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet of the group is as follows: Group 2008 2007 m % m % Equities 177.7 43 249.5 54 Corporate bonds 121.2 30 22.6 5 Fixed interest gilts 38.2 9 34.8 7 Index-linked gilts 51.0 12 53.8 12 Cash and money market funds 22.6 6 105.0 22 Total fair value of scheme assets 410.7 100 465.7 100 Present value of funded defined benefit obligations 359.8 404.2 Net retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet 50.9 61.5 The net retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet of the company is as follows: Company 2008 2007 m % m % Equities 43.2 43 65.4 56 Corporate bonds 29.5 30 6.1 5 Fixed interest gilts 9.3 9 9.5 8 Index-linked gilts 12.4 12 14.4 12 Cash and money market funds 5.5 6 22.0 19 Total fair value of scheme assets 99.9 100 117.4 100 Present value of funded defined benefit obligations 83.8 97.9 Net retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet 16.1 19.5 The assets and liabilities of the groups defined benefit pension scheme have been allocated between subsidiary companies on a pro-rata basis based upon the actual employer cash contributions made by each subsidiary company.
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008 Provident Financial plc Financial StatementS Notes to the financial statements continued 115 19 Retirement benefit asset continued The amounts recognised in the income statement were as follows: Group Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m Current service cost 5.7 6.7 1.8 1.0 Interest cost 22.9 22.6 7.3 4.2 Expected return on scheme assets 29.8 28.8 9.5 5.4 Net credit charge before settlement and curtailment credits 1.2 0.5 0.4 0.2 Settlement credit 13.3 Curtailment credit 2.9 Net credit recognised in the income statement 1.2 2.4 0.4 13.5 The net credit recognised in the income statement of the group in 2008 of 1.2m has been included within administrative expenses and relates wholly to continuing operations.
The net charge before curtailment credit of 0.5m in 2007 was included within administrative expenses and comprised 0.4m in respect of continuing operations and 0.1m in respect of discontinued operations.
Following the disposal of the insurance business on 15 June 2007, the relevant employees of that business ceased to be active members of the groups pension schemes.
Accordingly, their benefits were no longer linked to future salary increases and, therefore, the defined benefit obligation relating to them was less than that anticipated prior to the disposal.
The reduction in the defined benefit obligation of 2.9m was recognised as a curtailment credit in the consolidated income statement in the year ended 31 December 2007.
This amount was included within the profit on disposal of the insurance business see note 6.
The settlement credit of 13.3m in the company in 2007 related to the reallocation of the groups retirement benefit asset on disposal of the insurance business.
As noted on page 114, the assets and liabilities of the groups pension schemes are allocated between subsidiary companies on a pro-rata basis based upon the actual employer cash contributions made by each subsidiary company.
Following the disposal of the insurance business, the company retained the pension liabilities relating to those employees.
Accordingly, the assets and liabilities previously allocated to the insurance business were transferred to the company.
The settlement credit reflects the net retirement benefit asset transferred.
Movements in the fair value of scheme assets were as follows: Group Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m Fair value of scheme assets at 1 January 465.7 467.9 117.4 60.0 Expected return on scheme assets 29.8 28.8 9.5 5.4 Actuarial losses gains on scheme assets 78.9 0.1 24.5 3.9 Reallocation of pension assets on disposal of insurance business 57.2 Section 75 contribution on disposal of insurance business 3.4 Assets relating to international business on demerger 31.3 Contributions by the group company 5.3 4.0 1.1 0.4 Contributions paid by scheme participants 2.5 3.0 0.8 0.3 Net benefits paid out 13.7 10.2 4.4 2.0 Fair value of scheme assets at 31 December 410.7 465.7 99.9 117.4 The Section 75 contribution on disposal of the insurance business of 3.4m in 2007 was the statutory pension debt arising as a result of the insurance business ceasing to participate in the groups pension schemes following sale.
It was calculated in accordance with Section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995.
The net retirement benefit asset relating to the demerged international business of 3.5m was removed from the groups balance sheet as part of the dividend in specie in 2007.
The net retirement benefit asset comprised 31.3m of scheme assets and 27.8m of defined benefit obligation.
The expected contributions to the defined benefit pension scheme in the year ending 31 December 2009 are 7.9m.
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008 Provident Financial plc Financial StatementS Notes to the financial statements continued 116 19 Retirement benefit asset continued Movements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation were as follows: Group Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m Defined benefit obligation at 1 January 404.2 459.0 97.9 59.5 Current service cost 5.7 6.7 1.8 1.0 Interest cost 22.9 22.6 7.3 4.2 Curtailment credit 2.9 Reallocation of pension liabilities on disposal of insurance business 43.9 Liabilities relating to international business on demerger 27.8 Contributions paid by scheme participants 2.5 3.0 0.8 0.3 Actuarial gains on scheme liabilities 61.8 46.2 19.6 9.0 Net benefits paid out 13.7 10.2 4.4 2.0 Defined benefit obligation at 31 December 359.8 404.2 83.8 97.9 The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows: Group and company 2008 2007 % % Price inflation 2.90 3.40 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.20 4.97 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.90 3.40 Discount rate 6.30 5.70 Long-term rate of return equities 8.15 7.85 bonds 6.00 4.70 fixed interest gilts 3.80 4.50 index-linked gilts 3.80 4.25 cash and money market funds 3.80 5.90 overall weighted average 6.33 6.59 The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity investments reflect long-term real rates of return historically experienced.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate should be determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds and that the term of the instruments chosen should be consistent with the estimated term of the defined benefit obligations.
In the UK, this is usually interpreted to mean the yield on AA-rated corporate bonds of an appropriate term.
A movement of 0.1% in the discount rate would increase or decrease the retirement benefit asset by approximately 8m 2007: 10m.
The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme are based on the mortality experience of insured pension schemes and allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
The group continues to use the PA92 series of standard tables combined with the medium cohort improvement factors for projecting mortality.
However, for the purposes of the mortality assessment as at 31 December 2008, all life expectancy assumptions have been increased by one year in recognition of general practice in updating life expectancy recently.
In more simple terms, it is now assumed that members who retire in the future at age 65 will live on average for a further 22 years if they are male 2007: 21 years and for a further 25 years if they are female 2007: 24 years.
If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater for the scheme, the retirement benefit asset would have reduced by approximately 10m 2007: 11m.
