Significant accounting policies under IFRS The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Groups IFRS financial information are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of MITIE Group PLC and all its subsidiaries.
The financial statements of the parent Company and subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
Adjustments are made in the consolidated accounts to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist between UK GAAP and IFRS.
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Interests of minority Shareholders are measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Cost of acquisition includes all deferred amounts that become payable in the future.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
It is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 65 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost.
Intangible assets identified in a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Development expenditure relating to software is capitalised as an intangible asset if the asset created can be identified, if it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits and if the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Following initial recognition, the carrying amount of an intangible asset is its cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation expense is charged to administrative expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over its useful life.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue represents fee income recognised in respect of services provided during the period stated net of value added tax and is earned solely within the United Kingdom.
Revenue from multi-service contracts consists of various components which operate independently of each other and for which reliable fair values can be established.
Accordingly, each component is accounted for separately as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.
Revenue from long-term contracts represents the sales value of work done in the year, including fees invoiced and estimates in respect of amounts to be invoiced after the year end.
Profits are recognised on long-term contracts where the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
In calculating this, the percentage of completion method is used based on the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated cost.
Cost includes direct staff costs and outlays.
Full provision is made for all known or anticipated losses on each contract immediately such losses are forecast.
Gross amounts due from customers are stated at the proportion of the anticipated net sales value earned to date less amounts billed on account.
To the extent that fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are included in creditors as gross amounts due to customers.
Variations in contract work and claims are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated before investment revenue and finance costs.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Leasing Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Any lease incentives are amortised over the lesser of the life of the operating lease or to the first opportunity for termination.
Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Retirement benefit costs The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes and participates in a number of other defined benefit schemes.
In respect of the other schemes in which the Group participates, the Group accounts for its legal and constructive obligations over the period of its participation which is for a fixed period only.
In addition, the Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
Payments to the defined contribution and stakeholder pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
66 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside profit and loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straightline basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold property over 50 years Leasehold improvements period of the lease Plant and vehicles 310 years Annually the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs represent materials, direct labour and overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition and location.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and estimated selling costs.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises financial assets and liabilities only when the contractual rights and obligations are discharged or expire.
Assets that are assessed not to be individually impaired are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables includes the Groups past experience of collecting payments, the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the income statement.
MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 67 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Financial assets comprise loans and receivables and are measured at initial recognition at amortised cost.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables are measured at fair value.
There are no financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit and loss or held for trading.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Pre-contract costs All bid costs are expensed through the income statement up to the point where contract award or full recovery of costs is virtually certain.
Bid costs incurred after this point are then capitalised within trade and other receivables.
On the contract award these bid costs are amortised through the income statement over the contract period by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes.
For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the corresponding expense is recognised on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 April 2005.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 above, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised for certain project based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity.
This is measured by comparing the proportion of costs incurred against the estimated whole-life contract costs except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of cash-generating units and also the selection of the appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to use in order to calculate present values.
The carrying value of goodwill is 203.3m 2007: 148.4m at the balance sheet date: see Note 11.
Retirement benefit obligations The calculation of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, mortality rates, future returns on assets and future contribution rates.
The present value of retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date is 129.4m 2007: 143.3m : see Note 34.

Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs in the following business segments, which is how goodwill is monitored by the Group internally.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 2% per annum.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows from CGUs are as follows: 2008 2007 % % Facilities Services 11.4 9.2 Property Services 11.4 9.2 Engineering Services 11.4 9.2 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 73 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 12.

Limits and scoring are updated as appropriate.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables at the balance sheet date is the fair value of trade receivables.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debt.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Included in cash and cash equivalents are deposits totalling 12.4m 2007: 10.3m held by the Groups insurance subsidiary, which are not readily available for the general purposes of the Group.
The credit risk on liquid funds and financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by recognised international credit-rating agencies.

Financial risk management objectives The Groups Treasury function monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group.
These risks include credit risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
In addition, where appropriate, certain debts are subject to credit insurance.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Foreign currency risk The Group has very limited trading transactions in foreign currency and currently there is no hedging of these exposures.
Any material transactions would be appropriately hedged.
Liquidity risk The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a cash flow projection model which considers the maturity of the Groups assets and liabilities and the projected cash flows from operations.
Bank facilities which allow for appropriate headroom in the Groups daily cash movements are then arranged.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities: In the second to Within one year fifth years Total At 31 March 2008 m m m Trade creditors 173.6 173.6 Other creditors 6.6 6.6 Accruals and deferred income 55.2 55.2 Financing liabilities 54.5 3.7 58.2 Financial liabilities 289.9 3.7 293.6 In the second to Within one year fifth years Total At 31 March 2007 m m m Trade creditors 155.3 155.3 Other creditors 2.6 2.6 Accruals and deferred income 51.3 51.3 Financing liabilities 30.9 2.8 33.7 Financial liabilities 240.1 2.8 242.9 Market risk The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of interest rates.
However, all Group debt is currently due to short-term working capital fluctuations and hence is not hedged as at 31 March 2008.
The Groups Treasury function reviews its risk management strategy on a regular basis.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2008 and reserves would decrease increase by 0.1m 2007: 0.1m.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt per Note 25 and equity per Note 28.
The Groups capital structure is reviewed regularly.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Provision is made for contingent deferred consideration, which may become payable from 20082013 subject to profit targets being attained, at the best estimate of the directors.
A total of 1.1m was provided for deferred consideration to the minority shareholders of MITIE Technology Limited and MITIE Engineering Services Liverpool Limited, 15.3m in respect of Robert Prettie including the unwinding of discounted deferred contingent consideration and 4.5m in respect of other current year acquisitions.
The provision for insurance claims represents amounts payable by MITIE Reinsurance Company Limited in respect of outstanding claims incurred at the balance sheet dates.
These amounts will become payable as each years claims are settled.

Integration costs of 0.4m have been absorbed within the Property Services division.
As the Group acquired Robert Prettie on 2 April 2007 there is no difference between the revenue and profit as reported from that which would have been made had the acquisition been made on the first day of the financial year.
The unwinding of the discounted deferred contingent consideration gave rise to a 0.8m finance charge in the year.

Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for qualifying employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds controlled by the scheme providers.
Defined benefit schemes Group defined benefit schemes The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes called the MITIE Group PLC Pension Scheme and the MITIE Group PLC Passport Pension Scheme where MITIE Group PLC is the principal employer.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from the Group.
Contributions to the schemes are charged to the income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
Under the schemes, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 0 and 66% of final salary on attainment of a retirement age of 65.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The schemes are funded schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the Group schemes assets and the present value of their defined benefit obligations were carried out at 1 April 2005 by Mr David Higgs, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries.
Other defined benefit schemes Grouped together under Other schemes are three 2007: two schemes in which the Group is a participating employer and several schemes to which the Group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to our customers defined benefit schemes in respect of certain TUPE employees.
These valuations are updated by the actuaries at each balance sheet date.
The present values of the defined benefit obligations, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
For the Admitted Body Schemes principally the West Midlands Pension Fund, which are all part of the Local Government Pension Scheme, the Group will only participate for a finite period up to the end of the contracts.
The Group is required to pay regular contributions as decided by the relevant Scheme Actuaries and detailed in the schemes Schedule of Contributions.
In a number of cases contributions payable by the employer are capped and any excess recovered from the body that the employees transferred from.
In addition, in certain cases, at the end of the contract the Group will be required to pay any deficit as determined by the Scheme Actuary that is remaining for its notional section of the scheme.

The expected return on equities is the sum of dividend growth and capital growth net of investment expenses.
The return on gilts and bonds is the current market yield on long-term bonds.
The expected return on property has been set equal to that expected on equities less a margin.
The expected return on other assets is the rate earned by the scheme on cash.
