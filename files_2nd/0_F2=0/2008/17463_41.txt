Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to Enterprise Partnership and business sector.
The carrying amounts of goodwill are as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Xchanging Procurement Services 44,319 44,319 HR Enterprise 9,808 9,808 Ins-sure Holdings 3,942 3,942 RebusIS Insurance sector 8,460 8,460 RebusIS Business Lines sector 8,460 8,460 Xchanging Transaction Bank GmbH 270 270 Fondsdepot Bank GmbH 5,526 1,527 Xchanging Advisory Services formerly Landmark Business Consulting 3,794 4,214 Ferguson Snell and Associates 4,591 4,591 Xchanging Broking Services 29 29 Xchanging Procurement Services France SA formerly Mercuris SA 6,359 95,558 85,620 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on budgets approved by the Directors covering a three year period, which incorporate growth rates specific to each CGU.
Cash flows beyond the three year period are extrapolated to year five using a nil growth rate: a terminal value using nil growth is then added.
These long-term growth rates do not exceed the long-term average market growth rates in which the CGUs operate.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12.35% 2007: 12.35% is then applied to the projections.
This has been assessed as an appropriate discount rate for CGUs to which significant amounts of goodwill have been allocated, based on managements estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Management believes it is appropriate to use the same rate for all significant CGUs as they operate in geographical and operational segments with similar risks and these have not significantly changed from the prior year.
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to significant CGUs to exceed their respective recoverable amounts.
