EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Scottish and Southern Energy Group operates a number of share schemes for the benefit of its employees.
Details of these schemes, all of which are equity-settled, are as follows: i Discretionary share option scheme In the past, the Company operated this scheme, under which senior executives and staff were awarded share options.
The options granted to the senior executives from 1996 were subject to the performance criterion of normalised earnings per share over a three year period showing average compound annual growth rate of at least 2% above the increase in the UK retail price index for that year.
This criterion was met and any remaining discretionary share options are now exercisable.
This scheme has now ended and no options have been granted under this scheme since 1998. ii Savings-related share option schemes Sharesave This scheme gives employees the option to purchase shares in the Company at a discounted market price, subject to the employees remaining in employment for the term of the agreement.
Employees may opt to save between 5 and 250 per month for a period of three or five years.
At the end of this period, the employees have six months to exercise their options by using the cash saved including a bonus equivalent to interest.
If the option is not exercised, the funds may be withdrawn by the employee and the option expires.
iii Share Incentive Plan SIP This scheme allows employees the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company on a monthly basis.
Employees may nominate an amount between 10 and 125 to be deducted from their gross salary.
This is then used to purchase shares Partnership shares in the market on the final business day of each month.
These shares are then held in trust for a period of five years, at which point they are transferred at no further cost to the employee.
These shares may be withdrawn at any point during the five years, but tax and national insurance would then be payable on any amounts withdrawn.
In addition to the shares purchased on behalf of the employee, the Company will also match the purchase up to a maximum of five shares Matching shares per month.
Again these shares are held in trust for the five years until they are transferred to the employee.
If an employee leaves during the first three years, or removes his her Partnership shares, these Matching shares are forfeited.
In addition to the above, at 31 March 2005 and 31 March 2007 the Company made a special award of 50 and 20 free shares respectively.
These awards were made to all employees in employment at both 31 March and 20 August 2005 for the 2005 award, and 31 March and 30 May 2007 for the 2007 award, in recognition of their contribution to the success of the Company.
Under the arrangements for the award, the shares will be held in trust for five years, at which point they will be transferred to the employees at no cost to the employee.
These shares may be withdrawn at any point during years four and five, but tax and national insurance would then be payable on any amounts withdrawn.
iv Deferred bonus scheme This scheme applied to senior managers and Executive Directors.
Those eligible were awarded shares based on performance in the year.
Scottish and Southern Energy Annual Report 2008 101 This amount was then used to purchase shares in the market which are held in trust on behalf of the employee for a period of three years, at which point the employee is entitled to exercise the award.
In addition to shares purchased using the adjusted bonus award, additional shares will also be purchased using any dividends received on the shares held by the trust.
If the employee resigns, they lose all outstanding awards.
This scheme has been replaced by the current Annual Bonus Scheme.
Under this scheme, 25% of eligible employees annual bonus is deferred into shares which only vest after three years, subject to continued service.
The number of shares awarded is determined by dividing the relevant pre-tax bonus amount by the share price shortly after the announcement of the results for the financial year to which the bonus relates.
v Performance Share Plan This scheme applies to Executive Directors and senior executives.
Those eligible are awarded a maximum value of share awards of up to 150% of base salary previously 100%.
These awards will vest after three years to the extent that certain performance conditions are met.
These performance conditions are as follows: 50% of the award is subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR target relative to other FT-SE100 companies over the performance period, with full vesting if the Company is above the 75th percentile and 25% 2007 30% vesting if the Company is at the median, with pro rata vesting between the median and 75th percentile: the remaining 50% of the award is subject to an Earnings Per Share EPS growth target with full vesting occurring if adjusted EPS is 9% 2007 8% above RPI per annum and 25% 2007 30% vesting if adjusted EPS is 3% above RPI per annum with pro rata vesting between 3% and 9% 2007 3% to 8% above RPI.
There will be no vesting of the relevant portion of the award if the TSR minimum target is not met or the minimum EPS growth target is not achieved.
As allowed by IFRS 2, only options granted since 7 November 2002, which were unvested at 1 January 2005, have been included.
A charge of 10.8m 2007 - 6.8m was recognised in the Income Statement in relation to these schemes.
Employee Share-Based Payments continued ii Savings-related share option scheme continued No options were forfeited or exercised in the year.
Of the outstanding options at the end of the year, none were exercisable.
The fair value of these shares at vesting, calculated using the Black-Scholes model, and the assumptions made in that model for the Group and the Company are as follows: July 2003 July 2004 July 2005 July 2006 July 2007 3 Year 5 Year 3 Year 5 Year 3 Year 5 Year 3 Year 5 Year 3 Year 5 Year Fair value 659p 667p 730p 739p 1,012p 1,023p 1,216p 1,226p 1,593p 1,619p Expected volatility 17% 17% 17% 17% 15% 15% 19% 19% 25% 25% Risk free rate 4.7% 4.8% 4.7% 4.8% 4.1% 4.2% 4.7% 4.7% 5.8% 5.7% Expected dividends 4.6% 4.6% 4.6% 4.6% 4.2% 4.2% 4.8% 4.8% 5.3% 5.2% Term of the option 3 yrs 5 yrs 3 yrs 5 yrs 3 yrs 5 yrs 3 yrs 5 yrs 3 yrs 5 yrs Underlying price at grant date 630p 630p 699p 699p 967p 967p 1,180p 1,180p 1,460p 1,460p Strike price 562p 562p 622p 622p 886p 886p 999p 999p 1,306p 1,306p Expected price volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous 12 months.

However, the fair value of shares granted in the year is equal to the weighted average price paid for the shares at the grant date as shares are acquired out of the market as at that date to satisfy awards made under the scheme.
Shares purchased under this scheme prior to 7 November 2002 have not been included as permitted by the transitional rules under IFRS 1.
