Assuming that movie subscriber numbers remain unchanged from current levels, an additional 296 million US$590 million of commitments 2007: 284 million, US$569 million would also be payable in US dollars, relating to price escalator clauses.
The pound sterling television programme rights commitments include similar price escalation clauses that would result in additional commitments of 3 million 2007: 10 million if subscriber numbers were to remain at current levels.
ii The third party payment commitments are in respect of distribution agreements for the television channels owned and broadcast by third parties, retailed by the Group to retail and commercial subscribers Sky Distributed Channels and are for periods of up to six years 2007: seven years.
The extent of the commitment is largely dependent upon the number of retail subscribers to the relevant Sky Distributed Channels, and in certain cases, upon inflationary increases.
If both the retail subscriber levels to these channels and the rate payable for each Sky Distributed Channel were to remain at current levels subject to inflationary increases, the additional commitment would be 636 million 2007: 968 million.
iii Transponder capacity commitments are in respect of the Astra and Eurobird satellites that the Group uses for digital transmissions to both retail subscribers and cable operators.
The commitments are for periods of up to twelve years 2007: thirteen years.
Three additional transponder agreements were entered into in the year ended 30 June 2006 to provide capacity to facilitate the launch of the Groups HD services.
No additional agreements were entered into in the years ended 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2008. iv On 21 December 2007, the Group entered into a property development agreement to construct a new production and broadcast centre.
b Contingent assets The Group has served a claim for a material amount against EDS an information and technology solutions provider which provided services to the Group as part of the Groups investment in customer management systems software and infrastructure.
The amount which may be recovered by the Group will not be nally determined until resolution of the claim.
c Contingent liabilities and guarantees In April 2007, Virgin Media Communications Limited, Virgin Media Television Limited and Virgin Media Limited issued proceedings in the High Court in England and Wales against British Sky Broadcasting Group plc and British Sky Broadcasting Limited, alleging that the Group has infringed Article 82 EC and the Chapter II prohibition by pursuing an anticompetitive strategy designed to weaken Virgin Media group, which allegedly entailed i a constructive refusal to supply the Groups basic pay television channels to Virgin Media group for supply via Virgin Media groups cable network in the UK: ii a refusal to pay fair prices for the right to carry Virgin Media groups television channels as part of the Groups retail channel offering: and iii the Groups purchase of a significant shareholding in ITV which purchase was, it is alleged, designed principally to damage Virgin Media groups ability to compete in the supply of pay television services, by preventing Virgin Media group from obtaining access to attractive programming content.
Virgin Media group seeks from the Court a declaration thatthe Groupoccupies  specified pay TV retail and purchasing markets in theUKand thatthe Group has, by its conduct as alleged, abused its dominant position s contrary to Article 82 EC and the Chapter II prohibition on these relevant markets.
Virgin Media group also seeks mandatory injunctions requiring the Group to transact with Virgin Media group on fair and or non-discriminatory terms for the supply of the Groups basic pay television channels to Virgin Media and for the licensing of Virgin Media groups television channels, for on-supply to the Groups subscribers.
Virgin Media group also seeks damages to compensate it for its alleged losses arising from the Groups alleged conduct.
The Group intends to defend the proceedings vigorously and submitted its defence to the High Court on 2 July 2007 denying Virgin Media groups allegations that it had infringed Article 82 EC or Chapter II prohibition.
It is, at this stage, too early to estimate the likely outcome of the proceedings.
On 7 May 2008 the Nomenclature Committee of the European Commission issued an Explanatory Note EN 0590 2007 to the Combined Nomenclature setting out their view that set-top boxes with a hard drive should be classied under Customs Tariff heading 8521 90 00 and so subject to a 13.9% ad valorem duty on importation tothe European Union.
As a consequence the Group is exposed to potential retrospective Customs Duty liability in respect of such set-top boxes imported by Amstrad Plc acquired in September 2007 and for the reimbursement of certain suppliers in line with the terms of contractual supply agreements.
Managements opinion is that the retrospective application of the Explanatory Note would be wrong as a matter of law.
In addition management considers that the adoption of the EN puts the EU in breach of the Information Technology Agreement of 1996, a view which is shared by the US and Japan who have instigated WTO  EU on this matter.
