QXD 5 3 09 10:05 Page 103 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 28 Financial instruments continued c Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates or equity prices, will affect the Groups income or the carrying amount of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to achieve a level of market risk that is within acceptable parameters as set out in the Group risk management framework.
Interest rate risk The Group is not exposed to significant interest rate risk as it does not have significant interest bearing liabilities and its only interest bearing asset is cash invested on a short-term basis.
Certain of the Groups equity accounted joint ventures enter into interest rate swaps to manage their exposure to interest rate risk arising on floating rate bank borrowings.
The Groups share of joint ventures interest rate and Retail Prices Index swap contracts with nominal values of 75.6m 2007: 29.4m have fixed interest payments at an average rate of 5.11% 2007: 4.98% for periods up until 2035.
The Groups share of the fair value of swaps entered into at 31 December 2008 by joint ventures is estimated at a 2.3m liability 2007: 2.2m liability.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
All interest rate swaps are designated as hedging instruments and are effective as cash flow hedges.
The fair value thereof has been taken to the hedging reserve note 23.
Currency risk The majority of the Groups operations are carried out in the United Kingdom and the Group has an insignificant level of exposure to currency risk on sales and purchases.
Given the insignificant exposure to foreign currency movements, the Groups policy is not to hedge foreign currency transactions unless they are material, at which point derivative financial instruments are entered into so as to hedge forecast or actual foreign currency exposures.
