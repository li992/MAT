The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections were closed to new entrants during 2002 03 and a defined contribution section was established within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
Defined contribution schemes are mainly adopted in overseas subsidiaries.
Full actuarial valuations of the defined benefit plans are carried out every three years.
The Halma Group Pension Plan was last assessed as at 1 December 2005, and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan as at 1 April 2006, using the projected unit method.
At those dates the market value of the plan assets were 71.5m for the Halma Group Pension Plan and 13.8m for the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan.
The actuarial value of these assets represented 60% and 59% respectively of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
These shortfalls are being addressed by increased company contributions.
Defined contribution schemes The amount charged to the Consolidated income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 2,016,000 2007: 1,592,000.
Defined benefit schemes The assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities are: 2008 2007 2006 Rate of increase in salaries 4.75% 4.25% 4.25% Rate of increase of pensions in payment pre-April 1997 3.50% 3.00% 2.75% Rate of increase of pensions in payment post-April 1997 3.50% 3.00% 2.75% 5.85% Discount rate 5.25% 5.00% Inflation assumption 3.50% 3.00% 2.75% Mortality assumption Halma pensioners PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 medium cohort plus one year Mortality assumption Halma non-pensioners PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 medium cohort plus one year PA 92 medium cohort Mortality assumption Apollo pensioners PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 C 2010 plus one year plus one year PA 92 medium cohort Mortality assumption Apollo non-pensioners PA 92 medium cohort PA 92 C 2020 plus one year plus one year If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater in the defined benefit plans, the gross deficit would have increased by approximately 3m.

A J Williams K J Thompson Directors Halma p. l. c. Annual report and accounts 2008 79 FINANACIAL GOVERfinance BUSINESS FINANACIAL GOVERfinance BUSINESS REVIEW REVIEW STATEMENTS STATE MENTS Notes to the Company accounts C1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The separate Company financial statements are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985 and have been prepared on the historical cost basis and comply with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The principal Company accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding years and are described below.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates prevailing at that date.
Any gain or loss arising from subsequent exchange rate movements is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings which are taken out for the purpose of hedging the Companys investments in overseas subsidiary companies are taken to reserves.
Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based payments are provided to employees under the Companys share incentive plan, share option plans and performance share plan.
The Company recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards.
For equitysettled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of the grant and is not subsequently remeasured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
As permitted by FRS 20 Share-based payment, the Company has applied FRS 20 retrospectively only to equity-settled awards that were granted on or after 7 November 2002 which had not vested at 3 April 2005.
Investments Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Fixed assets and depreciation Fixed assets are stated at cost less provisions for impairment and depreciation which, with the exception of freehold land which is not depreciated, is provided on all fixed assets on the straight-line method, each item being written off over its estimated life.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 2% Leasehold properties: more than 50 years unexpired 2% less than 50 years unexpired Period of lease Plant and equipment 8% to 20% Motor vehicles 20% Leases The costs of operating leases of property and other assets are charged as incurred.
Pensions The Company makes contributions to defined contribution pension plans, which are charged against profits when they become payable.
The Company also participates in a Group-wide defined benefit pension plan.
This plan is operated on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities, and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 17 the Company accounts for its contributions to the plan as if it was a defined contribution plan.
Deferred tax The Company provides for tax deferred because of timing differences between profits as computed for taxation purposes and profits as stated in the accounts, on an undiscounted basis.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised if recovery is considered more likely than not on the basis of all available evidence.
