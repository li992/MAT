28 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period: Short term Accelerated Retirement Other timing capital benefit intangible differences allowances obligations assets Total 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2006 2,087 4,112 5,407 10,406 7,024 On acquisition 6,318 6,318 Charge to profit or loss for the year 264 950 944 491 1,667 11111 At 1 April 2007 1,823 5,062 4,463 16,233 15,009 On acquisition 6 128 799 665 Charge to profit or loss for the year 382 202 1,263 1,766 81 11111 At 31 March 2008 1,441 5,258 3,328 15,266 15,755 11111 Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in accordance with the groups accounting policy.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes: 2008 2007 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 20,979 21,744 Deferred tax assets 5,224 6,735 11 15,755 15,009 11 At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 1,460,000 2007: 1,289,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
From 1 April 2008, the main rate of UK Corporation tax has been reduced to 28% from 30%.
As a result, the groups deferred tax assets and liabilities have been revalued at 28% being the rate at which they are expected to reverse.
This has resulted in a tax credit to the income statement of 1,126,000.
Subject to provisions contained within Finance Act 2008 being enacted as anticipated, the 31 March 2009 financial statements will reect an additional deferred tax liability of 750,000 relating to properties previously qualifying for Industrial Buildings Allowances.
