Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders for the relevant period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in existence less the weighted average number of own shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as for basic earnings per share with further adjustments to the weighted average number of ordinary shares to reflect the effects of all dilutive ordinary shares.
There are no differences between the profit for each financial year attributable to equity holders used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
The reconciliation of the figures used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share is given below: 2008 2007 Weighted Total Weighted Total average number average number thousands thousands thousands thousands restated Number of shares at 1 July 2007 and 1 July 2006 190,373 190,373 120,000 120,000 Issue of shares 2,593 1,267 20,763 12,547 Shares reclassified from debt 49,610 49,610 Number of shares at 30 June 2008 and 30 June 2007 192,966 191,640 190,373 182,157 Shares owned by employee trusts note 19 2,502 2,633 785 495 Shares held under Share Incentive plan 517 351 261 167 Shares held in nominee account under the Share award scheme note 17 iii 7,431 2,445 Shares held in nominee account on behalf of employees note 19 52,396 59,084 69,587 61,446 Basic number of shares 130,120 127,127 119,740 120,049 Shares owned by employee trusts note 19 2,502 2,633 785 495 Shares owned by Share Incentive trust 517 351 261 167 Shares held in nominee account under the Share award scheme note 17 iii 7,431 2,445 Shares held in nominee account on behalf of employees note 19 52,396 59,084 69,587 61,446 Employee share options 6,632 7,454 8,670 8,083 Dilutive number of shares 199,598 199,094 199,043 190,240 Earnings attributable to equity holders of the Group 33,569 33,569 35,168 35,168 8.

Financial risk management A qualitative analysis of the financial risks, which include credit, market and liquidity risks, facing the Group is provided in the Risk Management section to this Annual Report.
a Credit risk management Credit risk is the possibility that the Group may suffer a loss from the failure of one of our counterparties to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group is primarily exposed to credit risk in respect of amounts owed by related parties and segregated mandates and from cash deposits with banks.
i Counterparty credit rating and ageing according to the contractual due date Financial assets subject to credit risk are: 2008 2007 Note 000s 000s Cash and cash equivalents 14 44,253 51,531 Derivative financial instruments 3 Total excluding trade receivables 44,253 51,534 Amounts owed by related parties 13 23,452 31,472 Other trade receivables 13 4,803 2,055 Total trade receivables 28,255 33,527 Total 72,508 85,061 Cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term bank deposits and cash in hand.
At 30 June 2008, 99% of cash is held with a counterparty that is a major UK bank and is externally rated AA 2007: 99%.
Amounts owed by related parties and other trade receivables relate to management and performance fees owed by funds and segregated mandates managed by the Group.
The ageing profile of amounts owed by these counterparties at the end of the period is as follows: 2008 2007 000s 000s Not older than 30 days 27,665 33,368 Older than 30 days not older than 60 days 118 159 Older than 60 days not older than 90 days 445 Older than 90 days but not older than 120 days Older than 120 days but not older than 180 days 9 Older than 180 days 18 Total 28,255 33,527 Amounts not older than 30 days are neither past due nor impaired.
Amounts older than 30 days are past due but not impaired.
This represents 2% of the total fees outstanding 2007: 0.5%.
Historically, none of these counterparties have defaulted on their payments.
Due to the nature of the relationship between the Group and the counterparties, as disclosed in note 22, the Directors believe that no credit risk provision is required.
The maximum credit exposure is equivalent to the carrying fair value of the balances shown.
ii Concentrations of credit risk The Groups largest counterparty exposure at the end of each period is as follows: 2008 2007 000s 000s 1 AA rated bank 43,870 51,336 1 Standard & Poors ratings The amount of these exposures can change significantly each month.
BlueBay Asset Management plc Financial 72 Annual Report 2008 Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 9.
Financial risk management continued b Market risk management i Investments in funds Under the deferred compensation scheme, the Group awards shares in a range of BlueBay investment funds to employees.
The shares are subject to forfeiture and held until the point when the shares have vested unconditionally with the employee or until forfeiture note 4.
The Group calculates the market risk on these investments using a value at risk VaR methodology based on a one month time horizon, at a 95% confidence interval.
VaR is an estimate of the worst loss due to movements in market rates over a target horizon with a given level of confidence.
Volatilities and correlations of market rates including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates and equity prices are estimated from past observations and projected forward over the target horizon using a technique known as Monte Carlo simulation.
VaR is then measured as a quantile of the projected distribution of gains and losses.
The Monte Carlo simulation method estimates VaR by simulating random scenarios and revaluing all positions in the portfolio for each trial.
The method assumes lognormal price distributions of underlying risk factors and accounts for all non-linearities in portfolio positions unlike the parametric VaR model which does not.
This method accurately prices all types of complex non-linear positions as well as simple linear instruments.
It also provides a full distribution of potential portfolio gains and losses which need not be symmetrical, but does not take into account any non-normality in the underlying factors for example fat-tails or mean-reversion.
The main disadvantage of the Monte Carlo method is that simulations are computationally intensive and, consequently, cannot be calculated instantaneously.
The increase in the VaR in 2008 compared with 2007 reflects the increased investments in the funds.
2008 VaR of Investments in the funds Average Maximum Minimum during during during 30 June 2008 the year the year the year 000s 000s 000s 000s 450 657 1,106 408 2007 VaR of Investments in the funds Average Maximum Minimum during during during 30 June 2007 the year the year the year 000s 000s 000s 000s 454 203 454 66 ii Foreign exchange and interest rate risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.

The Groups revenue is received in US dollars and Euros.
From time to time, the Group may put in place short-term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge these future receivables.
There were no such contracts outstanding at the end of either accounting period.
At 30 June 2007, the Group also partially hedged against the foreign exchange exposure of its investments held as financial assets under the deferred compensation scheme.
Interest rate risk is the risk arising from unexpected or untoward movements in interest rates.
The Groups monetary assets earn interest at 20 basis points below the base rate.
As the Group does not have any debt financing, it is not exposed to interest rate risk.
BlueBay Asset Management plc Financial 74 Annual Report 2008 Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 9.
Financial risk management continued c Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed circumstances.
i Financial assets and liabilities The table below analyses the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and are all due within one year.
Year ended 30 June 2008: Financial assets 2008 2007 000s 000s Cash and cash equivalents 44,253 51,531 Financial assets 22,066 13,876 Derivative financial instruments 3 Trade receivables 28,255 33,257 Total financial assets 94,574 98,937 Financial liabilities 2008 2007 000s 000s 8,278 3,866 The Groups total financial assets exceed its total financial liabilities in the ratio of 11.4:1 2007: 25.6:1.
75 ii Commitments a Operating leases The Group leases office premises and computer software under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases disclosed as contractual undiscounted cashflows are as follows: 2008 2007 Leasehold Leasehold property property 000s 000s Commitments under non-cancellable operating leases expiring: Within one year 4,695 1,807 Later than one year and less than five years 18,755 24,741 After five years 37,612 37,687 Total 61,062 64,235 2008 2007 Computer Computer software software 000s 000s Commitments under non-cancellable operating leases expiring: Within one year 245 298 Later than one year and less than five years 63 381 Total 308 679 b Capital commitments 2008 2007 000s 000s Expenditure contracted for but not provided for in the Financial Statements: 406 c Contingent liabilities The Group is not aware of any contingent liabilities as at the end of either accounting period.
d Capital Management The Group uses its capital primarily to support the growth of the business and to provide it with a cushion to shield it from adverse market conditions.
In order to determine its primary capital requirements, the Group uses multi-year financial models to determine the capital requirements of its anticipated growth.
The Group develops a number of potential adverse scenarios in order to determine their effect on various financial measures, including the Groups capital base.
This enables the Group to determine the amount of capital that should be retained in the business for prudential purposes.
Once this primary objective has been met, the Group uses available distributable reserves for purposes such as paying dividends to shareholders, funding the equity incentivisation programme and providing seed capital for new funds, if required.
From time to time the Group has provided financing to the EBT and its SIP to enable them to purchase BlueBays shares in the market.
The timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
The shares are intended to be used for awarding shares to employees under the Groups sharebased incentive schemes.
There is no specific buy back plan.
The Group also manages its capital requirements in line with the regulatory capital limits set by the Financial Services Authority.
The Group has been in compliance with the regulatory capital requirements at all times during the year.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management in the year.

Details of these schemes can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 40 to 47 to these Financial Statements and are summarised in the notes below.
The fair value of the employee services rendered in exchange for the share awards and options granted previously under these schemes is recognised as an expense through the Income Statement.
The expense is based on the fair value of the share-based payment transactions on grant date, spread over the vesting period.
During the year, the following expense was charged to the Income Statement in respect of equity settled, share-based transactions: 2008 2007 000s 000s EMI Scheme i 266 Unapproved option award scheme ii 156 155 Share award scheme iii 4,120 SIP Scheme iv 556 266 Total 4,832 687 i Enterprise Management Incentive EMI Option Award Scheme The Group issued share options through its EMI scheme in December 2005.
A total of 20,700,000 options under this scheme were exercised when the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange on 22 November 2006.
As a condition of exercise, the Company required the holders of the EMI options to enter into an agreement not to sell their resulting shares for a period of up to four years following Listing although 25% of these ordinary shares became available for sale on each anniversary of the date of exercise of the EMI options.
On 22 November 2007, selling restrictions on the first 25% of the shares held by employees were lifted.
The scheme is no longer operative and there are no options outstanding under this scheme.
During the year, the movement in respect of restricted ordinary shares issued following the exercise of EMI options at listing was as follows: 2008 2007 000s 000s Balance at 1 July 20,675,000 EMI options exercised 20,700,000 Shares sold on open market 5,964 1,919 Shares vested unconditionally 5,162,500 Shares forfeited to Group employee benefit trust Note 19 119,036 23,081 Restricted shares unsold at 30 June 15,387,500 20,675,000 ii Unapproved Option Award Scheme The Group operated a second option award scheme, not approved by HMRC, where selected employees were eligible to participate.
All grants under this scheme were made in 2006, prior to listing and there have been no new awards during the year.
In general terms, providing an optionholder remains an employee of the Group, options may be exercised in accordance with a vesting schedule as follows: 25% on or after each of 30 January 2007, 30 January 2008, 30 January 2009 and 30 January 2010.

Shares awarded vest unconditionally with employees over a period of five years after the grant date with 25% of the shares vesting on each anniversary of the date of award, commencing two years after the grant date.
The fair value of the shares is measured on the grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the underlying shares.
The fair value of the shares granted is taken to be the market price at the date of award.
The amount recognised in the Income Statement is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual number of shares that vest.
