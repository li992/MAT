The recoverable amounts of the property, plant and equipment are determined from value in use calculations unless management is committed to closing or selling the business.
If the value of the business is to be recovered through sale or closure then the recoverable amount is the fair value less costs to sell.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The Company prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates these cash flows in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector.
The growth rate does not exceed 3.0% 2006 07: does not exceed 3.0% and is not considered to be higher than the average long term industry growth rate.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.1% 2006 07: 10.0%.

The fair value of the financial assets approximates to their carrying value.
The fair value of the financial liability held at amortised cost in a cash flow hedging relationship has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying period end exchange rates.
The disclosure of the fair value is shown in note 25.
The directors use their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for derivatives that are designated and effective as hedging instruments carried at fair value, but that are not quoted in an active market.
Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied and assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument.
The fair value of the other financial liabilities at amortised cost approximates to their carrying value.
The trade and other payables approximate to their fair value due to the short term nature of the payables.
Long term loans due to subsidiary undertakings are interest free and have no fixed date of redemption.
Payables due to subsidiary undertakings carry a fixed interest rate linked to market rates.

The rate reduction has been substantively enacted and therefore has been used for the deferred tax calculation on UK businesses.
Although amendments to the Industrial Buildings Allowance regime were also proposed in the Finance Act 2007, these amendments were not substantively enacted at 29 March 2008 and accordingly have not been reflected in the Companys results for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2008.
The directors have estimated that, had these amendments been reflected in the Companys results for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2008 in respect of existing industrial buildings held by the Company, the effect would be to increase the deferred tax liability held in the balance sheet by approximately 6.5m.
No deferred tax has been provided on capital losses totalling 56.0m at 29 March 2008 2006 07: 26.1m as it is uncertain when these losses will be utilised against future taxable gains.
The unprovided deferred tax asset on these losses is 15.7m 2006 07: 7.8m.
