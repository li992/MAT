Financial instruments and related disclosures Treasury policy The Groups treasury departments main responsibilities are to: Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group: Manage the interest risk of the Groups debt: Invest surplus cash: Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group, and Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Finance Director FD.
The FD controls policy and performance through the line management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the Treasury Committee.
The Treasury Committee meets regularly to monitor the performance of the Treasury function.
Monthly Treasury Reports provide management information relating to treasury activity.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The Groups debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at a competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group.
The Group has a syndicated five-year term facility totalling 300m that provides the Group with committed bank facilities until July 2011.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows: Financial risk The Business Plan and cash flow forecasts are subject to key assumptions such as interest rates and the significance of these risks is dependent upon the level of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and the strength of the balance sheet.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants.
The aim is to reduce exposure to the effect of interest rates movements by hedging at least 40% of the following periods net interest rate exposure, whilst maintaining the flexibility to minimise early termination costs.
Foreign currency risk The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct source purchases of its supplies from the Far East, with most of the trade being in US dollars.
The Groups policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual costs do not exceed the budget costs by 10% excluding increases in the base cost of the product.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 52 weeks to 28 March 2008, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge between 75% and 80% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 15-month basis.
Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts, spot rates and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Credit risk The Groups policy is to minimise the risk that foreign exchange and interest rate derivative counterparties, the holders of surplus cash and the providers of debt will be unable to fulfil their obligations and also, in the case of lenders, unwilling to extend the loan facilities when they expire.
The Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an A credit rating at the time of syndication July 2006.
Ancillary business, in the main, is directed to the eight banks within the syndicated Group.
The Treasurer is responsible for determining creditworthiness of each counterparty, based on the overall financial strength of the counterparty.
The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee and the Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when required.
The Group ensures that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan.
The minimum liquidity level is currently set at 30.0m.
Forecast liquidity is reviewed each month by the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast requirements Covenants are monitored on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would lead to an Event of Default.
Calculations are submitted at least biannually to the syndication agent.
Reporting on covenant compliance forms part of the Treasury Report.
There have been no breaches of covenants during the reported periods.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Since June 2006, the Group has managed its capital partly through a share buy-back scheme, details of which are given in note 19.
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios.
These ratios are lease adjusted net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA and fixed charge cover.
Lease adjusted net debt is calculated as being net debt and leases capitalised at eight times, as a multiple of EBITDA plus operating lease charges.
Fixed charge cover is calculated as being EBITDA plus operating lease charges as a multiple of interest and operating lease charges.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Fair value assumptions Trade receivables, trade payables The fair value on these items approximate to their carrying value.
and finance lease obligations Short-term deposits and borrowings The fair value of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to markets rates at intervals of less than one year.
Forward currency contracts The fair value of forward currency contracts are calculated by using the closing spot rate and respective forward points as of the balance sheet date and comparing this to the outright contract rate.
Interest rate swaps The fair value of interest rate swaps are calculated by taking the closing UK market rate for the outstanding period and comparing this to the outright contract rate.
Trade and other receivables The following table reconciles trade and other receivables which fall within the scope of IAS 39 to the relevant balance sheet amounts.
Other assets include prepayments and accrued income which are outside the scope of IAS 39.

The following analyses are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in relevant foreign exchange and interest rates.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar financial instruments, the major currency in which the Groups financial instruments are denominated.
The Group has considered the movement in the US dollar over the last two years and has concluded that 5% is a reasonable benchmark.
2008 2007 Increase Increase decrease decrease in equity in equity m m 5% appreciation of the US dollar 5.0 3.8 5% depreciation of the US dollar 4.1 3.1 There are no material movements in the income statement.
The movements in equity relates to the fair values movements on the Groups forward contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity.
Due to all financial instruments held at the balance sheet date.
It does not reflect changes in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
Interest rate sensitivity The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to interest rates on its interest rate swap.
2008 2008 2007 2007 Increase in Reduction Increase in Reduction finance cost in equity finance cost in equity m m m m 1% increase in sterling interest rates 1.1 1.8 1.1 1.8 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
The movement in equity includes the fair value movement on the fixed leg of the Groups interest rate swap.
The movement in the income statement reflects the effect on finance costs on the unhedged borrowings of the Group as shown in the table below.
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do not present a material exposure to the Groups balance sheet.
