The carrying value has been considered separately for each subsidiary.
Cash ow statement The Company is exempt, under Financial Reporting Standard FRS 1 Revised from the requirement to prepare a cash ow statement as a Group cash ow statement has been prepared.
Taxation Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.

Share-based payment transactions The Companys equity incentive schemes allow its employees to acquire shares in Novae Group plc.
The fair value of options and LTIP shares granted are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial lattice model, the Black-Scholes formula and a Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to re ect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to failure to meet vesting conditions.
FRS 20 has not been applied to arrangements prior to 7 November 2002, and those options granted subsequently that had vested by 1 January 2005.

This meets the requirements of UITF 41 scope of FRS 20.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable issue costs, and thereafter at amortised cost.
