Financial statements and information annual report and accounts 2008 37 IFRS 7 sensitivity analysis The Group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% 100 basis points in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in Sterling against all material currencies Euro, US Dollar and Indian rupee for each class of financial instrument with all other variables remaining constant.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post-employment benefit obligations.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: Interest rate risk changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are recognised at their fair value.
Under these assumptions, a 1% increase or decrease in market interest rates would decrease or increase profit before tax by approximately 800,000 2007: 500,000.
The impact on equity before tax would be 600,000 if the rate increased 2007: 400,000 or decreased 2007: 800,000.
Foreign exchange risk material entities reporting in foreign currencies and material foreign currency financial instruments within Sterling reporting entities have been included.
With a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all material currencies Euro, US Dollar and Indian Rupee, profit before tax would have decreased by approximately 1,000,000 2007: 300,000 or increased by 1,200,000 2007: 400,000, respectively, and equity would have decreased by approximately 4,700,000 2007: 3,000,000 or increased by 5,800,000 2007: 3,700,000 respectively.
Fair value sensitivity analysis This fair value sensitivity analysis expresses information about changes in fair values of financial instruments for the year end.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may vary materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial markets.
These may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes in fair values of financial liabilities which affect equity are set out in the table below: Fair value changes arising from: Carrying 1% 10% value at fall in weakening 31 December interest rates in Sterling Note 000 000 000 2008 Borrowings 23 276 Other financial liabilities 23 24,119 602 1,685 2007 Borrowings 23 1,511 47 Other financial liabilities 23 17,865 777 1,127 Credit risk Details of the Groups credit risk policies and exposures are presented in note 3.
An analysis of all debts which are past due is included in note 20.
Price risk The Groups investments, classified as available-for-sale financial assets, are publicly traded.
A 5% increase or decrease in the market value of the Groups investments would have a 1,300,000 impact on equity 2007: 1,200,000 and no impact on the income statement.
