Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.

Actual results may differ from these estimates.
indd 54 08 04 2009 11:18 08 04 2009 11:18 16254 8 4 2009 Proof 7 2 Significant accounting policies continued Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
These policies together with references to the related notes to the financial statements can be found below: Taxation Note 7 Intangible assets Note 11 Impairment of Goodwill and intangible assets Note 11 Share-based payments Note 21 Regulatory compliance and contingent liabilities Note 26 Discontinued operations As a result of enactment of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act UIGEA in October 2006, the Group withdrew from offering real-money activity to the US facing market.
Although the Group did not operate the US facing business as a separate business, it was a separate geographical segment of the Groups business and in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations the income statement and related notes were required to show continued and discontinued operations separately.
There was no impact of these matters in respect of the year ended 31 December 2008.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange rate differences on foreign currency transactions are included in administrative expenses.
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from US dollars are translated into the presentation currency as follows: i monetary assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: ii income and expenses for each income statement are translated at an average exchange rate unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions : and iii exchange rate differences on translation of Group entities that have functional currencies different from US dollars are included in administrative expenses.
Taxation The tax expense represents tax payable for the year based on currently applicable tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs from its tax base.
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities assets are settled recovered.
Intangible assets Acquisitions Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets.
For acquisitions during the year 2007, the useful economic life of the intangible assets acquired is estimated to be between three months and four years.
Intangible assets are reviewed annually for evidence of impairment.
Any impairment in carrying value is charged to the consolidated income statement.
Internally generated intangible assets Expenditure incurred on development activities is capitalised only when the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
All other development expenditure is expensed.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
The Group estimates the useful life of these assets as between 3 and 5 years.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Cost comprises the fair value of any assets acquired, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued, plus any direct costs of acquisition.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement.
Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated income statement on the acquisition.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Carrying amounts are reviewed at each balance sheet date for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets less their estimated residual values over their expected useful lives.
The annual depreciation rates are as follows: IT equipment 33% Office furniture and equipment 7%15% Motor vehicles 15% Leasehold improvements Over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful lives 56 888 Holdings plc www.

Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount i. e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the assets cash generating unit i. e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Financial instruments The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost and principally comprise amounts due from credit-card companies and from e-payment companies.

Chargebacks The cost of chargebacks is included in operating expenses.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated.
Segment information A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing an individual product or service or a group of related products or services and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.

Share-based payments Where the Company grants its employees or contractors shares, nil priced options or market value options, the fair value at the date of grant is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
Non-market performance conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest.

10 Acquisitions made during the prior year Online Bingo business On 16 May 2007 the Group acquired the assets comprising the online Bingo business of Globalcom Limited Bingo Business for an allcash consideration.
In calculating the goodwill arising on acquisition, the fair value of the net assets of the Bingo business were valued by a professional valuation firm and recognised in accordance with IFRS 3 and adjustments from book value have been made where necessary.
These adjustments are summarized as follows: Book value Fair value on acquisition adjustments Fair value US$000 US$000 US$000 1 Property, plant and equipment 81 81 2 Intangible assets 200 4,114 4,314 Net assets 281 4,114 4,395 1 See note 12.
The fair value relates to the recognition of customer lists US$888,000, royalty agreements US$1,113,000, licensing agreements US$2,113,000 and other intangible assets US$200,000 acquired as part of the acquisition.
These intangibles are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of between three months and four years.
All intangible assets on acquisition have been identified and fair valued.
The remaining goodwill represents the access to future trade with the Bingo customers.

The intangible assets include acquisitions of customer lists, royalty agreements, licensing agreements and certain software developed acquired as part of the acquisition of the assets comprising the online Bingo business of Globalcom Limited.
These intangibles are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of up to four years.
On acquisition, the intangible assets have been identified and valued using third party professional valuers.
At the year end, the carrying value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the online Bingo business to their present value.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were those regarding discount rate and growth rates of the business.
The Directors estimate discount rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the online Bingo business.
The discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is a discount rate of 12% being the Groups specific weighted average cost of capital.
In estimating the future cash flows the Group has used conservative estimates in respect of revenues generated and costs incurred.
Growth rates of the online Bingo business are based on past experience and projections of future changes in the online gaming market, taking into account external sources of information such as analysts research reports.
These suggest that Bingo is expected to remain one of the fastest developing sectors with an estimated Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR of 14% by the end of 2012.
The Group has used lower and declining growth rates in estimating the future cash flows conservatively reflecting the current uncertainties about the medium term global economic outlook.
The Directors have used forecasts for the next five years of the expected cash flows, of which the first year is based on the Groups current approved budget.
Following year five, the Group extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity, using an estimated growth rate of 1%, which is based upon the expected long-term growth rate of the UK economy.
Costs associated with the Bingo cash generating unit were projected as a percentage of revenues and have been assumed to continue to increase by 10% in each of the five year period to 2013, over and above the level of growth in revenues.
The Directors are not aware at this time of any need to change their key assumptions on which they have based their determination of the recoverable amount of the goodwill which would cause its carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
In fact, although such movements are not expected to arise, neither a 1% a decrease in the growth rate in each of the next three years nor a 5% increase in the discount rate would have led to an impairment of the acquired intangible assets and goodwill in the current year.
The Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its acquired intangible assets and goodwill, or when such events or changes in circumstances indicate that these may be impaired.
The result of the review, undertaken at 31 December 2008, was that no impairment needs to be recognised and the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets and goodwill is considered appropriate.

Consideration of US$513,000 was fully paid before year end.
Contingent consideration of up to US$800,000 is not expected to be paid.
The Directors have performed a valuation of the intangible asset acquired.
The Directors took into account the following factors, amongst others, in determining the fair value of this intangible asset: l Domains ranking with search engines l Traffic ranking as a measure of popularity l Number of unique visitors to the site l Number of links pointing to the domain The Directors concluded that the fair value that should be assigned to the intangible asset is US$13,000 whilst the remainder of US$500,000 is to be recognised as goodwill given that trade balances acquired were incidental.
No further IFRS 3 disclosures have been given on the grounds of materiality.
Internally generated intangible assets During the year the Group has put in place processes and procedure which enable it to ascertain technological feasibility before development costs are incurred and therefore be in a position to capitalise costs incurred after that point.
Such expenditure is only capitalized when the development cost meet the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria as set out in IAS 38 Intangible assets.
These assets are subject to impairment test wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable on the same basis as described above for acquired intangible assets.
At 31 December 2008 no impairment needs to be recognised and the carrying value of internally generated assets is considered appropriate.

24 Financial risk management The Group is exposed through its operations to risks that arise from use of its financial instruments.
Policies and procedures for managing these risks are set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Financial Officer.
The Board reviews the effectiveness of these procedures and, if required, approves specific policies and procedures in order to mitigate these risks.
The main financial instruments used by the Group, on which financial risk arises, are as follows: l Cash and cash equivalents l Restricted cash l Trade and other receivables l Available-for-sale financial assets l Trade and other payables l Liabilities to customers Detailed analysis of these financial instruments is as follows: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 Financial assets US$000 US$000 Trade receivables 9,026 13,430 Other receivables 9,541 6,100 Cash and cash equivalents 97,522 103,505 Restricted cash 922 803 Available-for-sale financial asset 223 654 117,234 124,492 In accordance with IFRS 7, with the exception of available for sale assets, all financial assets are classified as loans and receivables.

Capital The Capital employed by the Group comprises equity attributable to shareholders.
The primary objective of the Group is maximizing shareholders value, which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by maintaining the capital structure most suited to the Groups size, strategy, and underlying business risk.
Other than disclosed elsewhere in note 26 there are no demands or restrictions on the Groups capital.
indd 72 08 04 2009 11:18 08 04 2009 11:18 16254 8 4 2009 Proof 7 24 Financial risk management continued The main financial risk areas are as follows: Credit risk Trade receivables The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables who are the Groups payment service providers PSP.
These are third party companies that facilitate deposits and withdrawal of funds to and from customers virtual wallet with the Group.
These are mainly intermediaries that transact on behalf of the main credit card companies.
The risk is that a PSP would fail to discharge its obligation with regard to the balance owed to the Group..
The Group reduces this credit risk by: l Monitoring those balances on a regular basis.
l Arranging for the shortest possible cash settlements intervals.
l Replacing rolling reserve requirements, where they exist, with a Letter of Credit by a reputable financial institution.
l Ensuring a new PSP is only contracted following various due diligence and Know Your Customer procedures.
l Ensuring policies are in place to reduce dependency on any specific PSP.
The Group believes that based on the above and on extensive past experience the PSP receivables are of good credit quality and there is no requirement to provide for any potential bad debts arising from a PSP failing to discharge its obligation.
None of the balances owed by the various PSP are overdue or impaired.
An additional credit risk the Group faces relates to customers disputing charges made to their credit cards chargebacks or any other funding method they have used in respect of the services provided by the Group.
Customers may fail to fulfil their obligation to pay which will result in funds not being collected.
These chargebacks and uncollected deposits, when occurring will be deducted at source by the PSPs from any amount due to the Group.
As such the Group provides for these eventualities by way of a provision based on analysis of past transactions.
This provision is netted off from the trade receivables balance and at 31 December 2008 was $1,070,000 2007: $845,000.
The Groups in-house Fraud and Risk Management department carefully monitors deposits and withdrawals by following prevention and verification procedures using internally developed bespoke systems integrated with commercially available third party measures.
Cash and cash equivalents The Group controls its cash position out of its Gibraltar headquarters.
Subsidiaries in its other locations Israel, Antigua and London maintain minimum cash balances which are deemed required for their operations.
Cash settlement proceeds from PSPs, as described above, are paid into bank accounts controlled by the Treasury function in Gibraltar.
The Group segregates funds due to customers and holds these funds in separate bank accounts.
These funds are not used to fund activity other than that directly related to customers.
The Group maintains its funds with highly reputable financial institutions and will not hold funds with financial institutions with low credit rating.
The Group maintains its cash reserve in highly liquid deposits and regularly monitors rates in order to maximize yield.
Restricted cash Restricted cash is mainly attributed to a deposit in respect of the Groups obligation with the developer of the offices of its subsidiary in Israel.

The Group monitors its liquidity in order to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to allow it to meet its obligations.
In the case of the Groups liability to its customers, the Group maintains these deposits in separate bank accounts which are not used for its day-to-day operations.
The Group has ensured that cash earmarked to fund its final dividend payment for 2008 is in place.
The Group expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances and will not need to resort to any borrowing.

The Groups policy is to invest surplus funds in low risk money market funds or on call over night facilities.
The Group also arranged with its principal bankers that excess funds are swept automatically across its accounts, every night, in order to maximize availability of funds for investments.
Downside interest rate risk is minimal as the Group has no borrowings.
A 0.5% movement in bank interest rates would not have a significant impact on finance income for the year or the prior year.
Currency risk The Groups financial risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations is mainly attributed to: l Mismatch between Balance sheet Liabilities to customers which is predominately denominated in US$ and the net receipts from customers which are settled in the currency of the customers choice, of which sterling GBP, euros EUR, and Canadian dollar CAD are significant.
l Mismatch between reported revenue which is mainly generated in USD the Groups functional and reporting currency and significant portion of deposits which are settled in local currencies.
l Expenses, the majority of which are denominated in foreign currencies, including sterling GBP, the euro EUR and the New Israeli Shekel ILS.
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk and takes steps, where practical, to ensure that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, inter alia, by using foreign exchange forward contracts designed to fix the economic impact of known liabilities.
At 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007, there were no outstanding forward contracts.
There were no significant fair value movements on these contracts during the year.
Its responsibility is to manage the cash resources of the Group and minimise the various exposures associated with holding, and investing these funds.

The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of such claims and actions.
Regulatory issues As part of the Boards ongoing regulatory compliance and operational risk assessment process, the Board continues to monitor legal and regulatory developments, and their potential impact on the business, and continues to take appropriate advice in respect of these developments.
Following the enactment of the UIGEA on 13 October 2006, the Group stopped taking any deposits from customers in the US and barred such customers from wagering real-money on all of the Groups sites.
Notwithstanding this, there remains a residual risk of an adverse impact arising from the Group having had customers in the US prior to the enactment of the UIGEA.
The Board is not able to identify reliably at this stage what if any liability may arise and accordingly no provision has been made.
On 5 June 2007 the Group announced that it has initiated preliminary discussions with the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York.
It is too early to assess any particular outcome of these discussions.
