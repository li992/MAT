The classification of fair value gains and losses on derivatives has been revised in the year.
Fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments which are taken out to mitigate the Groups foreign currency exposure on its financial investments are now classified within Gains on financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss on the income statement.
Previously, gains and losses on these derivative financial instruments were classified after finance costs on the income statement.
The change, which has no impact on profit before tax, has been made in accordance with IAS 8 as in the opinion of the Directors, it results in more relevant information about the effect of derivative transactions.
Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments which have been taken out to mitigate the Groups exposures on its loans and borrowings continue to be classified after finance costs on the income statement.
