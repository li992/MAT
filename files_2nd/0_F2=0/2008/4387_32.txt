Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 02.
Accounting policies for the Impact of new standards and interpretations Group financial statements Not yet adopted continued continued An amendment to IFRS 7 was issued in March 2009.
This will require enhanced disclosure relating to the fair value measurements and liquidity risk of financial instruments in the note disclosures.
As the amendment was only recently issued, the impact on the Group is still being considered, however it is expected that the adoption of the revised standard will not impact on the Groups reported income or net assets.
Upon adoption of IFRS 8, the Group will have to disclose information to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the different business activities in which it engages and the economic environment in which it operates.
For the Groups current business activities, the identification, aggregation and measurement of reportable segments under IFRS 8, may result in the Group having three reportable segments as opposed to the current single business segment which is reported in accordance with IAS 14 Segment Reporting, the prevailing standard that IFRS 8 will replace.
The Group has reviewed the impact of the standard on the 2008 results as if it were adopted early and has assessed that apart from additional disclosures required, there would be no further impact.
On the basis of the current borrowing facility described in note 21, and the Groups accounting policy for finance costs and debt described on page 66, the adoption of IAS 23 Revised will not impact the Group.
No IFRIC issued during the year will impact on the results or disclosures of the Group.
