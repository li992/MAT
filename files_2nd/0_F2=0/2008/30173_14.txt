Derivative financial instruments Cross currency interest rate swap and forward foreign exchange contract In August 2004, the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap whereby it receives a xed rate of interest of 8.25% and pays a variable interest rate equal to US LIBOR plus 2.69%.
The notional amount of the swap is 64.2m with an exchange of principal of US$117m.
The maturity date of the swap is August 2009.
The counterparty to the swap is a financial institution with a credit rating of AAat 31 December 2008.
Until October 2008 the swap was designated and effective as a fair value hedge of 64.2m of the 150m Eurobond and as a net investment hedge of US$117m of dollar denominated net assets.
In October 2008 the swap was fide-designated as a net investment hedge and fair value hedge.
A forward foreign exchange contract was entered into at the same time to offset the foreign exchange position inherent in the swap.
Fair value gains or losses on the swap since fide-designation and fair value gains or losses on the forward foreign exchange contract are included in the income statement.
Fair value gains and losses on the effective portion of the net investment hedge up until the date of fide-designation are included in equity.

Prior to fide-designating the cross currency interest rate swap as a net investment hedge, movements in the cross currency interest rate swap due to changes in exchange rates were recorded in equity.
Following fide-designation, such movements are re ected in pro t or loss.
Movements in the forward foreign exchange contract due to changes in exchange rates are re ected in pro t or loss.
The retranslation of net investment in foreign currencies is excluded from the following table.
Based on a 5% weakening in the US dollar and Euro exchange rates against sterling, the effect on pro t for the year and equity would be as follows: 2008 2007 USD EUR USD EUR m m m m Change in pro t for the year 0.8 1.3 1.5 0.7 Change in equity 3.1 The Group would experience an equal and opposite foreign exchange gain should sterling weaken against the US dollar and Euro.
e Interest rate sensitivity analysis Interest on oating rate financial instruments is reset at intervals of less than one year.
The Groups exposure to interest rates arises on cash and cash equivalents, money market instruments, the cross currency interest rate swap, bank overdrafts, loan notes, and the bank loan.
The Eurobond and the obligations under finance leases are xed rate financial instruments.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates, applied to average oating rate financial instrument assets and liabilities during the year, would result in the following impact on pro t or loss: 2008 2007 m m 100 basis point increase in interest rates oating rate assets 3.0 2.5 oating rate liabilities 2.9 2.4 Net impact on pro t for the year 0.1 0.1 The Group would experience an equal and opposite impact on pro t should interest rates reduce by 100 basis points.

Share-based payments As at 31 December 2008 the Group had two equity-based long term incentive plans for the granting of non-transferable options to certain employees and executives.
Options granted under these plans, once vested, typically become exercisable three years after grant date.
The exercise of certain options is dependent on option holders meeting performance criteria, all of which are non-market conditions.
The maximum life of the options is 10 years after grant date.
Options are settled in equity once exercised.
The Tullett Prebon plc Employee Bene t Trust 2007 the EBT was established on 30 October 2007 as an employee share scheme to provide equity incentivisation to certain employees within the Group.
Shares held by the EBT are transferred to employees on completion of the awards performance criteria.
The following table summarises the share award schemes that existed at 31 December 2008 and the estimated fair values of awards when granted: Awards Estimated outstanding fair value at 2008 grant date Share award scheme Tullett Liberty Equity Incentive Plan i, ii 383,626 191-249p Tullett Prebon Long Term Incentive Plan i 3,816,279 389p Tullett Prebon plc Employee Bene t Trust 2007 ii 463,782 400-463p 4,663,687 Notes: i Subject to revenue, margin performance and return on capital conditions.

The estimated fair value of each option granted was calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends based on historical dividend payment, expected life of the option until exercise and a risk-free interest rate based on government securities with a similar maturity pro le.
The estimated fair value of each share granted under the Tullett Prebon plc Employee Bene t Trust 2007 was calculated based on the share price at grant date, adjusted for the non-accumulation of dividends.

Retirement bene t obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world, all of which, with the three exceptions identi ed below, are fide ned contribution schemes.
The assets of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group, either in separate trustee administered funds or in contract-based policies of insurance, except for those held in North America to match the liabilities of a supplemental executive retirement plan SERP C. The Group operates fide ned bene t schemes in the UK and in North America: i The Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme fide ned Bene t Section is a fide ned bene t final salary funded pension scheme.
The principal employer of the scheme is Tullett Prebon Group Limited.
The fide ned bene t section of the scheme was closed to new members in 1991 and since May 2003 future accrual on a fide ned bene t basis has ceased.
Members in service in 1991 receive bene ts on the better of a money purchase underpin and fide ned bene t basis.
For fide ned bene t section members in service in May 2003 there is a continuing link between bene ts and pensionable pay.
ii The Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme is a fide ned bene t final salary funded pension scheme.
The scheme was closed to new members in 1989 and since April 2006 future accrual on a fide ned bene t basis has ceased.
Members receive bene ts on the better of a money purchase underpin and fide ned bene t basis.
For members in service in April 2006 there is a continuing link between bene ts and pensionable pay.
iii The Prebon Yamane US SERP C plan provides participants in North America with retirement bene ts for 10 or 15 years at a speci ed dollar amount.
The entitlement of the participants to the plan bene ts vests over time in accordance with length of service, up to a maximum period of 10 years.
SERP C was introduced in 1992 and the last participant was admitted in 1999.
The previous plan, SERP B, provided participants with a target retirement bene t, but all investment gains and losses are borne by the participant and SERP B is therefore treated as a fide ned contribution scheme.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid into the UK fide ned bene t schemes during 2009 is 7.2m.
The latest actuarial valuations of the Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme and of the Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme together, the UK fide ned bene t schemes were carried out as at 30 April 2007 and 1 January 2007 respectively by independent quali ed actuaries.
The present value of the vested liabilities under the Prebon Yamane US SERP C are recalculated monthly using an appropriate discount rate and the necessary additional accrual or release of accrual is made in the accounts of the relevant subsidiary undertaking as a pension cost.
As at 31 December 2008 the SERP C liability included in the balance sheet within long term payables was 0.9m 2007: 1.0m.
In order to cover this liability the Group holds policies of insurance with a cash surrender value as at 31 December 2008 of 0.7m included in the balance sheet within trade and other receivables 2007: 1.1m.

Retirement bene t obligations continued The main financial assumptions used by the independent quali ed actuaries of the UK fide ned bene t schemes to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 were: 2008 2007 % % Key assumptions used: Discount rate 6.10 5.80 Expected return on schemes assets 6.41 7.25 Expected rate of salary increases 4.05 4.65 Rate of increase in LPI pensions in payment 2.70 3.40 In ation assumption 2.80 3.40 This applies to pensions accrued from 6 April 1997.
The majority of current and future pensions receive xed increases in payment of either 0% or 2.5%.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements and are the same as those adopted for the 2007 funding valuations.
For the Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme the assumptions are that a member who retires in future at age 60 will live on average for a further 30 years 2007: 28 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 31 years 2007: 31 years after retirement if they are female.
For the Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme the equivalent assumptions are 30 years 2007: 24 years for males and 31 years 2007: 27 years for females.
Current pensioners are assumed to have a consistent but generally shorter life expectancy based on their current age.
