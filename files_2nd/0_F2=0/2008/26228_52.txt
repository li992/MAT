Derivative liabilities are reported in the balance sheet within Payables and other financial liabilities.
Non-unit linked derivative assets have increased from 239m to 2,365m, primarily as a result of the movements in sterling interest rate hedging activities and the acquisition of assets backing guaranteed equity bond contracts with Nationwide Life 713m.
Non-unit linked derivative liabilities have also increased from 385m to 2,504m reflecting hedging of market movements in exchange rates and inflation.
The notional amounts of some derivative instruments provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet.
However, these amounts do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Groups exposure to credit or price risks.

Forward foreign exchange contracts net investment hedges The Group hedges part of the foreign exchange translation exposure on its net investment in its overseas subsidiaries, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
It recognises the portion of the gain or loss which is determined to be an effective hedge through reserves within shareholders equity, along with the gain or loss on revaluation of the foreign subsidiaries.
Interest rate swap contracts fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge fixed rate loans in particular to hedge the movement in the fair value of a loan due to interest rates.
Fair value gains and losses arising from fair value hedging relationships are as follows: Fair value gains on hedging instruments were 55m 2007: 9m.
Fair value losses on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk were 60m 2007: 10m.
The total fair value gain on hedging instruments shown above excludes fair value losses arising from factors which are outside the designated hedging relationship of 20m 2007: gain of 2m.
Derivative contracts held for trading The Group uses certain derivative contracts which are effective hedges of economic exposures in accordance with the Groups risk management policy, but for various reasons are not designated within a formal hedge accounting relationship.
Therefore, these contracts must be designated as held for trading and gains and losses on these contracts are recognised immediately in the income statement.
