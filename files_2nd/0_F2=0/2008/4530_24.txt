Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 30 August 2008 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION AND GENERAL INFORMATION INTRODUCTION Debenhams plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985 Company No.
The address of the registered oce is Debenhams plc, 1 Welbeck Street, London, W1G 0AA.
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries togetherthe Grouporthe Debenhams Group is the sale of fashion clothing and accessories, cosmetics and products for use in the home.
The Group trades from department stores and small store formats in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, on the internet and has international franchise stores.
The Group prepares its Financial Statements for the financial year ending on the nearest Saturday to 31 August of a given calendar year.
The principal companies within the Group during the financial year ended 30 August 2008 are disclosed in note 33.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs including International Accounting Standards IAS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under accounting standards as adopted for use in the EU.
The Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year ended 30 August 2008 and 1 September 2007 have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modied by the revaluation of available-for-sale investments, derivatives, share-based payments and pensions.
The preparation of the Financial Statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the use of estimates and assumptions that aect the reporting amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these results are based on managements best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual results ultimately may dier from those estimates.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Groups principal accounting policies are described below.
CONSOLIDATION The Financial Statements comprise a consolidation of the accounts of Debenhams plc and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries include all entities including special purpose entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies.
The existence and eect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group has the power to control.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
On consolidation, inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of sta discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, and is stated net of value added tax and other salesrelated taxes.
Revenue on department store sales of goods and commission on concession sales are recognised when goods are sold to the customer.
Retail sales are usually in cash or by credit or debit card.
Department store customer special orders and internet sales are recognised when the goods are delivered to the customer.
Revenue from gift vouchers and gift cards sold by the Group are recognised on the redemption of the gift voucher or gift card.
It is the Groups policy to sell its products to the end customer with a right of return.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of sale.
INTEREST RECOGNITION Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the interest rate applicable.
DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION A final dividend distribution to the Group shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Group shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS The asset recognised in respect of dened benefit schemes is the fair value of the plan assets less the present value of the dened obligation at the balance sheet date.
The dened benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the dened benefit obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in sterling, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to the terms of the related pension liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the Income Statement and presented in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expenses.
64 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED RETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS CONTINUED Past service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the changes in pension plans are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group operates a dened contribution scheme in Ireland and a stakeholder scheme in the UK.
Contributions to these pension schemes are charged to the Income Statement as they fall due.
Dierences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
The Group measures the fair value using the valuation technique most appropriate to value each class of award, either a Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo or Binomial pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the eect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises the estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Exceptional items are events or transactions which, by virtue of their size or nature, have been disclosed in order to improve a readers understanding of the Financial Statements.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE A FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATIONAL CURRENCY Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups functional and presentational currency.
B GROUP COMPANIES The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency dierent from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet: income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative eect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transaction : and all resulting exchange dierences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
C TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency at average monthly rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Dierences on exchange are taken to the Income Statement.
TAXATION Taxation expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profits for the financial period using tax rates that are in force during the period.
Taxable profit diers from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary dierences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
If deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction aects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary dierences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary dierences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversals of the temporary dierences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary dierences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2008 65 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 30 August 2008 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED LEASED ASSETS A FINANCE LEASES Leases of assets which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are classied as finance leases.
Finance leases are classied as a financial liability and measured at amortised cost.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property, plant and equipment or the present value of the minimum lease payments and depreciated over the period of the lease.
The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
B OPERATING LEASES All other leases are classied as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases, net of lease incentives, are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where property lease contracts contain guaranteed xed minimum incremental rental payments, the total committed cost is determined and is calculated and amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS A GOODWILL Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identiable assets of the acquired subsidiary.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised, but tested for impairment annually, or when trigger events occur, and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which have been allocated to groups of cash-generating units which are split on a regional basis.
B OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Acquired licences and trademarks are capitalised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life, not to exceed ten years.
Internally generated software costs, where it is clear that the software developed is technically feasible and will be completed and that the software generated will generate economic benefit, are capitalised as an intangible asset.
The software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, being three to eight years.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT It is the Groups policy to hold properties at cost, subject to the requirement to test assets for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at the following rates per annum to write o the cost of property, plant and equipment, less residual value, on a straight-line basis from the date on which they are brought into use: Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings 1 per cent Long leaseholds including landlords xtures and ttings 1 per cent or life of lease if shorter Short leaseholds including landlords xtures and ttings Life of lease Retail xtures and ttings 5-20 per cent Oce equipment 10 per cent Computer equipment 16-331 3 per cent Vehicles 25 per cent or life of lease The assets useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the Income Statement.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets in the course of construction.
These assets comprise stores which are under construction, including costs directly attributable to bring the asset into use.
Transfers to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment are made when the store opens.
No depreciation is provided on stores or other assets under construction.
IMPAIRMENT TESTING Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped by store, which is the lowest level for which there are separately identiable cash ows cash generating units.
66 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS The Group classies its investments as available-for-sale financial assets in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Available-for-sale financial investments are non-derivative assets.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Investments are recognised at fair value plus any transaction costs.
The fair value of available-for-sale investments denominated in a foreign currency is calculated in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the reporting date.
An impairment test is performed annually on the carrying value of each investment.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the retail method and represent goods for resale.
Concession stocks are not included within stocks held by the Group.
TRADE RECEIVABLES Trade receivables, dened as loans and receivables in accordance with IAS 39, are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eective interest method for any doubtful amounts.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the dierence between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash ows discounted at the eective interest rate.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the Income Statement.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at the bank and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
BORROWINGS Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any dierence between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the eective interest method.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
BORROWING COSTS Borrowing costs that are facility costs are recognised initially at fair value and are amortised over the term of the facilities at a constant rate on the committed amount of the facility.
TRADE PAYABLES Trade payables, dened as financial liabilities in accordance with IAS 39, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eective interest method.
All of the trade payables are non-interest bearing.
PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and, where it is more likely than not, an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
SHARE CAPITAL Ordinary shares are classied as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares in equity are shown as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
DERIVATIVES The derivative instruments used by the Group to manage its interest rate and currency risk are interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as an eective hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash ow hedges.
Derivatives are recognised using trade date accounting.
At the inception of the transaction the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly eective in osetting changes in cash ows of hedged items.
Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2008 67 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 30 August 2008 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED DERIVATIVES CONTINUED I CASH FLOW HEDGES The eective portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineective portion is recognised immediately in the relevant line of the Income Statement which will be aected by the underlying hedged item.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the underlying hedged item when the underlying hedged item is recognised on the Balance Sheet or in the Income Statement.
When a hedged instrument expires, is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is immediately recognised in the relevant line of the Income Statement which will be aected by the original underlying hedged item.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the relevant line of the Income Statement, which would have been aected by the forecasted transaction.
II DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING Certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
III EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES Where the risks and characteristics of derivatives embedded in other contracts are not closely related to those of the contracts and the whole contract is not carried at fair value with gains or losses reported in the Income Statement, the derivative is separated from that host contract and measured at fair value, with fair value movements reected in the account in the Income Statement which will be aected by the underlying host contract.
NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS During the year, the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC issued the following standards and interpretations, which are eective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after the stated eective date.
These standards and interpretations are not eective for, and have not been applied in, the preparation of this financial information.
During the year the Group adopted IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, and the complementary amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements Capital disclosures, which introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments and does not have any impact on the classication and valuation of the group or companys financial instruments, or the disclosures relating to taxation and trade and other payables: Effective date INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IFRS IAS IFRS 8 Operating Segments January 2009 IFRIC INTERPRETATIONS IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes September 2009 The Group is currently considering the implications of the adoption of these standards and interpretations.
They are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups operations.
3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT A FINANCIAL RISKS AND TREASURY MANAGEMENT The board established an overall treasury policy and has approved policies, procedures and authority levels within which the treasury function Group Treasury must operate.
The Finance Director conducts treasury reviews at least monthly and the board receives regular monthly reports covering treasury activity.
The treasury committee meets and reviews the report on a quarterly basis.
Group Treasury manages the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the agreed treasury policies and procedures.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, primarily include borrowings, cash and liquid resources, trade receivables and trade payables.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage liquidity or raise finance for the Group.
Group Treasury uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risks associated with the Groups nancing and currency risk arising from the Groups operations.
The derivatives used are mainly interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, which include: funding and liquidity risk: credit risk: foreign exchange risk: and cash ow interest rate risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse eects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
68 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes 3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: I FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY RISK Prudent liquidity risk management implies sucient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain exibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
The Group nances its operations by a combination of retained profits, debt finance and leases.
The objective is to ensure that there is sucient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash ow requirements of the Group for its current business plan.
Short-term requirements can be nanced by the 250.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which expires in 2011, of which 45.0 million was utilised at the balance sheet date.
II CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk where the Group can suer financial loss through default by customers or financial institutions.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or by credit and debit cards, wholesale sales of products to franchisees are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit-quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Cash surpluses are placed on deposit for no longer than three months and only with financial counterparties with a short-term credit rating of A1, P1 or better as assigned by either Standard and Poors or Moodys respectively.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements net of any allowances for losses, represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
III FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK The Groups functional currency is sterling.
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and also to the euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions relating to imports and trading in the Republic of Ireland.
To manage the foreign exchange transaction risk, entities in the Group use forward currency contracts transacted by Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when commercial transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the exposure in each foreign currency by using external forward currency contracts with a settlement of 18 months or less.
Up to 100 per cent of the first three months forecast purchases, up to 80 per cent of the next three months and up to 70 per cent for the following 12 months forecast purchases are hedged.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling business.
IV CASH FLOW INTEREST RATE RISK The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
The Groups current borrowing facilities are issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The interest exposure of the Group is managed within the constraints of the Groups business plan and the financial covenants under its facilities.
The aim is to reduce exposure to the eect of interest rate movements and to take advantage of low interest rates by hedging an appropriate amount of interest rate exposure whilst maintaining the exibility to minimise early termination costs.
The Groups interest rate hedging strategy is to achieve a target xed percentage of 75 per cent, with a 15 per cent tolerance 60-90 per cent.
The impact of movements in interest rates is managed through the use of oating rate debt and interest rate swaps.
These are usually matched with specic loans for a period of time up to their maturity or call date.
The Groups main interest rate exposure is from the oating rate loans under the credit facilities.
At the year end, hedged xed rate borrowings amounted to 752.5 million, being 72.0 per cent of the Groups total borrowings.
V OTHER PRICE RISK The Group is exposed to equity risk arising from equity investments.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date.
At the year end, if the valuations had been 10 per cent higher lower when all other variables were held constant: Net profit would have been unaected as the equity investments were classied as available for-sale investments: Other reserves would decrease increase by 0.6 million 2007: 1.6 million for the Group as a result of the changes in the fair value of availablefor-sale investments.
B CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benets to other stakeholders and to maintain a structure to optimise the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may consider the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2008 69 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 30 August 2008 3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED C FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows.
The fair value of forward currency contracts has been determined based on market forward currency exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
In the case of the Groups loans due in more than one year, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current market interest rates available to the Group.
There were no material dierences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities to their fair values at the year end.
4 SEGMENTAL REPORTING Based on an analysis of risks and returns, the directors consider that the Group has only one identiable business segment, retailing.
All material operations of the Group are carried out in the British Isles and therefore no geographical segmentation is disclosed.
The Group operates both an internet and an international division, both of which remain immaterial for the purposes of segmental reporting.
Consequently, the Group has considered business segmentation as the primary segmentation, with a single separately reportable segment, retailing.
5 GROSS TRANSACTION VALUE Revenue from concessions is required to be shown on a net basis, being the commission received rather than the gross value achieved by the concessionaire on the sale.
Management believes that gross transaction value, which presents revenue on a gross basis before adjusting for concessions, sta discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, represents a good guide to the value of the overall activity of the Group.
30 August 1 September 2008 2007 m m Gross transaction value 2,336.0 2,305.6 6 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by denition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are discussed below.
ESTIMATED IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL The Group tests whether goodwill has suered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.
The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
The method requires an estimate of future cash ows and the selection of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value of the cash ows.
TAXATION The Group is subject to income taxes in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
At each financial period end, judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on the best estimates at the balance sheet date.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is dierent from the amounts that were initially recorded, such dierences will impact the corporation tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value is calculated using the appropriate fair value model with the estimated level of vesting being reviewed annually by management.
The key assumptions of this model are set out in note 28.
PENSION LIABILITY The Groups dened benefit schemes pension liability, which is assessed each period by actuaries, is based on key assumptions including return on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates, ination, future salary and pension costs.
These assumptions, individually or collectively, may be dierent to actual outcomes.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions: additional information relating to this is disclosed in note 24.
ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT The Group estimates the useful life of property, plant and equipment and reviews this estimate at each financial period end.
The Group also tests for impairment whenever a trigger event occurs.

Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2008 71 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 30 August 2008 8 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Exceptional items are events or transactions that fall within the activities of the Group and which by virtue of their size or incidence have been disclosed in order to improve a readers understanding of the Financial Statements.
30 August 1 September 2008 2007 m m OPERATING EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Acquisition and reorganisation of stores in the Republic of Ireland 14.3 TOTAL OPERATING EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS BEFORE TAX 14.3 FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 1 SEPTEMBER 2007 ACQUISITION AND REORGANISATION OF STORES IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND On 12 September 2006 the Group acquired the business and assets of nine stores from Roches Stores, the total consideration on acquisition of the stores was 30.0 million.
Following the acquisition, the Group assigned the existing Dublin store lease Jervis Street which resulted in the closure of the store after the year end.
The acquisition of the stores, assignment of the lease and subsequent closure of the Jervis Street store created an accelerated depreciation charge of 6.3 million and redundancy costs of 4.6 million.
Marketing, travel, legal and integration costs amounted to 3.4 million.
Integration costs included 0.8 million of costs which related to the distribution centre and were charged to distribution costs, whilst all other costs related to the stores were charged to cost of sales.

It will be paid on 16 January 2009 to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 12 December 2008.
No liability is recorded in the Financial Statements in respect of the final dividend.
Shareholders may take this dividend in cash or as a scrip issue.
The reference price to be used in calculating an entitlement to new ordinary shares under the scrip dividend scheme is the average of the closing middle market price quotations of an ordinary share, derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Ocial List, for the five business days starting on the day the ordinary shares are first quoted ex-dividend.
14 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares, those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

The consideration for this acquisition was 30.0 million.
All tangible assets acquired have been recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired has been recognised as goodwill and amounts to 5.7 million.
The goodwill represents the intrinsic value to the Group of being able to trade the Debenhams brand in these stores.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS The computer software capitalised costs of 4.5 million 2007: 5.3 million principally relates to internally developed application software.
Externally developed application software costs capitalised during the year amounted to 0.8 million 2007: 1.0 million.
AMORTISATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS Amortisation on the Groups intangible assets has been charged to the Income Statement as follows for the financial years ended: 30 August 1 September 2008 2007 m m INCLUDED WITHIN: Cost of sales 4.5 4.6 Distribution costs 0.3 0.3 Administrative expenses 2.7 2.1 7.5 7.0 IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL The goodwill arising is not being amortised but reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which has been allocated to groups of Cash-Generating Units CGUs split on a regional basis according to the level at which management monitors that goodwill.
For the purposes of this impairment review, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These cash ow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash ows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated based on the assumption of no growth after year five.
The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the retail sector in which the CGUs operate.
The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the value in use was 7.3 per cent 2007: 7.5 per cent and reects the specic risks in the retail business.
Management determined the gross margin for each CGU based on performance and its expectations for the market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and risk-free rates.
As at 30 August 2008, no impairment of goodwill has been required 2007: nil.

The Group subsequently entered into full tenant and landlord repairing sub-leases for 125-years.
During the year one of the properties within this arrangement was sold.
This sale reduced the outstanding principal by 5.0 million.
At the year end the following amounts remained outstanding under the leases: 30 August 1 September 2008 2007 m m Principal 37.7 42.7 Accrued interest 11.2 12.6 Outstanding liability 48.9 55.3 The rentals payable are structured so as to give the lessors a nancing return linked to LIBOR in the first 25 years and, in the following ten years, a LIBOR linked return together with the repayment of capital.
Thereafter, market rentals are payable subject to revision every five years.
In the early years, the amounts payable are below LIBOR and in the later years are in excess of LIBOR.
The nancing costs are, however, allocated over the 25-year period so as to achieve an annual funding cost which is consistent with LIBOR.
The Group has limited rights up to the 25th year of the leases to vary the terms of the leases to buy out the rental obligations based on the propertiesoriginal sales proceeds.
The leases are reected in xed assets at their cost to the Group.
These property lease obligations are secured by a xed charge over the corresponding Group properties.
II OTHER LEASE OBLIGATION Other lease obligations relate mainly to computer software and vehicles leased under hire purchase contracts.

Derivatives are used to hedge the exposure to market risks.
Derivatives that are held for hedging are designated as cash ow hedged instruments in accordance with IAS 39.
The derivatives held for hedging are described below.
There is no material impact in the Income Statement resulting from ineective hedges.
I FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS The net fair value gains at 30 August 2008 on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk of anticipated future inventory purchases are 9.8 million 2007: losses of 1.2 million.
This will be recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the acquisition cost of inventory over the next 18 months.
Forward exchange contracts designated as cash ow hedges are reclassied to assets held for trading when the underlying forecast transaction is crystallised on the Balance Sheet as inventory.
During the year there were no contracts reclassied to assets held for trading due to cash ow hedges being ineective.
II INTEREST RATE SWAPS The Groups interest rate swaps switch interest from oating rates to xed rates.
The Groups interest rate swap portfolio matures as follows: Notional Rate m % Maturity Interest rate swaps 752.5 4.718-6.040 May 2010 to November 2011 The net gains and losses on these swaps deferred in equity will reverse through interest in the Income Statement over the life of the swaps.
Interest rate swaps that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classied as held for trading.
Changes in the fair value of any instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting is recognised immediately in the Income Statements within interest payable and other costs.
80 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Section 4 Financial Statements and Notes 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND ASSETS The interest rate proles of financial assets and liabilities after taking account of interest rate swaps, swapped from oating to xed rates, used to manage interest were as follows: 30 August 2008 Non-interest Fixed Floating bearing Total m m m m FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 1 Sterling 754.3 291.5 1,045.8 FINANCIAL ASSETS Sterling 2.6 0.9 21.5 25.0 Euro 0.8 14.9 1.2 16.9 US dollar 0.2 0.2 TOTAL FINANCIAL ASSETS 3.4 16.0 22.7 42.1 1 Debt issue costs of 9.7 million are excluded from the financial liabilities above.

Floating rate borrowings are interest bearing at interest rates based on LIBOR.
Cash deposits are interest bearing at rates based on LIBID or relevant base rates.
Non-interest bearing cash refers to cash in stores or in transit.
Floating rate borrowings have been classied as xed if there were derivative financial instruments hedging the oating rate interest for more than one year.

BORROWING FACILITIES AS AT 30 AUGUST 2008 As at 30 August 2008 the Term Loan Facility was fully drawn together with 45.0 million of the RCF.
The un-drawn element of the RCF at the year end is 205.0 million 2007: 250.0 million.
These facilities expire on 19 April 2011.
Both of these facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Group monitors interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk by determining the eect on profit of a range of possible changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The range of changes chosen, being 1 per cent movement in interest rates and 5 per cent movement in sterling compared to the US dollar, reects the Groups view of changes that are possible over the financial year.
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the Group as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to all the Groups financial instruments.
The analysis has been produced assuming no changes in the borrowings and existing interest rate swaps portfolio when considering the interest rate movement.
Similarly, when considering the movement in foreign exchange rates, the analysis assumes no changes in the volumes of imports.
This analysis in the table below is for information only and does not take into account any oset from renegotiated supplier contracts or alternative sourcing locations.

Both pension schemes were closed for future service accrual from 31 October 2006.
The closure to future accrual will not aect the pensions of those who have retired or the deferred benets of those who have left service or opted out before 31 October 2006.
Future pension arrangements are provided through a money purchase stakeholder plan or a dened contribution scheme for the employees in the Republic of Ireland.

An award under the PSP will normally vest on the third anniversary of date of grant and must be exercised within six months of vesting.
No payment will be required for the grant of an award.
An award under the PSP will comprise an option to receive free shares or nil cost option with performance conditions attached.
Awards under the scheme have been made since May 2006.
The vesting on half of the shares granted is dependent on Earnings Per Share EPS growth.
In accordance with IFRS 2 this is classied as a non-market condition and therefore the shares have been fair valued at face value.
The vesting of the remaining half of the shares is dependent upon Total Shareholder Return TSR over a three-year period when compared to total shareholder return of the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index.
The fair value of the PSP options granted for this proportion of the award is calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation model assuming the inputs shown below: Grant date 7 May 08 4 Feb 08 29 May 07 24 Nov 06 6 June 06 9 May 06 Number of share under option number 3,580,699 1,824,324 3,008,991 2,066,178 3,113 2,948,008 Expected term years 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.3 2.2 Share price at grant pence 65.0 70.0 137.5 198.3 185.0 205.0 Exercise price pence Risk free rate 5.7% 5.8% 6.0% 5.5% 4.7% 4.8% Expected volatility 34.0% 34.0% 21.0% 21.0% 21.0% 21.0% Expected dividend yield 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% Fair value of option pence : TSR 29.0 28.0 64.3 95.2 76.4 82.8 EPS 59.0 63.0 121.0 178.0 171.1 189.0 Volatility has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the Companys share price.
During the year 5,405,023 2007: 5,683,046 options were granted under the plan and no options were exercised.
II EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION PLAN THE ESOP The ESOP allows the Company to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees.
These options will normally become exercisable following a three-year performance period, only if and to the extent that the performance conditions to which they are subject have been satisfied.
With the exception of the first grant of options on 9 May 2006, being the date the Company was admitted to the London Stock Exchange, options were granted with an exercise price equal to the middle market value of the shares on the day immediately preceding the date of grant.
The vesting of options granted under this plan is dependent on EPS growth, the fair value of the share options has been calculated using a binomial model.
