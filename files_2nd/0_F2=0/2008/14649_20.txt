Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Corporate information The Groups consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 24 February 2009.
Spirent Communications plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
As required by the European Unions IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 1985, the Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include revaluation to fair value of certain instruments as described below.
The Group has prepared its financial statements under IFRS.
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 except in relation to the implementation of IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position other than in relation to IFRIC 14 which is discussed below.
International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS Effective date IFRIC 11 IFRS2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 January 2008 IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008 IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction 1 January 2008 IAS 39 & IFRS 7 Reclassification of Financial Assets 1 July 2008 IAS 19 Employee Benefits limits the measurement of a defined benefit asset to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan plus unrecognised gains and losses.
IFRIC 14 clarifies what effect the existence of a minimum funding requirement has on this limit and provides guidance as to when the employer has an unconditional right to a refund from the plan.
At 1 January 2007 the full amount of the defined benefit plan surplus had been recognised, but the surplus was restricted at 31 December 2007 to the present value of economic benefits available as a reduction in future contributions.
However, as clarified by IFRIC 14 an unconditional right of refund to the employer exists in the Spirent plans and therefore the full amount of the surplus should be recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2007.
IFRIC 14 requires provision to be made for any part of the surplus that would not be recoverable.
Any surplus on the plans that may ultimately be repaid to the Company would currently be subject to a 35 per cent tax charge prior to repayment.
IFRIC 14 requires that this liability be recognised at the balance sheet date.
The Comparatives have been restated accordingly.
There is no effect on the income statement for the year to 31 December 2007 nor on earnings per share.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2008 47 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued The effect of the implementation of IFRIC 14 on the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2007 is as follows: Defined benefit pension plan Retained surplus earnings million million As previously reported 3.0 93.4 Implementation of IFRIC 14 3.1 3.1 31 December 2007 restated 6.1 96.5 The effect of the implementation of IFRIC 14 on the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense for the year to 31 December 2007 is as follows: Irrecoverable element of Actuarial gains pension plan and losses surplus million million As previously reported 0.6 Implementation of IFRIC 14 4.7 1.6 31 December 2007 restated 4.1 1.6 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
Results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intra Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit, an operation within a cash-generating unit, an associate or jointly controlled entity is included in the profit or loss on its disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Separately identifiable intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees, trademarks and customer lists, and relationships are capitalised on the balance sheet only when the value can be measured reliably, or the intangible asset is purchased as part of the acquisition of a business.
Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Spirent Communications plc 48 Annual Report 2008 Financial statements 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets arising on the Groups various product development projects are recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: i an asset is created that can be separately identified such as software or a new process : ii it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: iii the development cost can be measured reliably: iv it is intended that the asset is completed and used: and v there is adequate financial, technical and other resources to complete, use or sell the asset.
Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development has been established.
Technological feasibility in Spirents circumstances occurs when a working model is completed.
For software development technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is complete.
After technological feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of all other assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement of those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
The increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2008 49 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Leases Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and are not finance leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity and excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value represents selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion and on sale.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.
Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that the Group will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Foreign currencies The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured in terms of historical costs using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transactions.
The functional currencies of the Groups operations are principally US dollar, sterling or euro.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated into the Groups presentation currency at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The results of foreign operations are translated into sterling using average rates.
Equity investments in foreign operations include long term intra group loans, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of opening net assets of Spirent Communications plc 50 Annual Report 2008 Financial statements 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued foreign investments and exchange adjustments arising from the translation of the results of foreign operations, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal should an operation be disposed of.
The Group has elected to apply the exemption in IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards which allows the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS, being 1 January 2003.
The gain or loss on the subsequent disposal of any foreign operation therefore excludes translation differences that arose before the date of transition.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at closing rates of exchange.
As permitted by IFRS 1 the Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS as an asset of the parent, and as such these are sterling denominated.
All other exchange profits and losses are taken to the income statement.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Equity instruments Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups policy is not to undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to the variability in cash flows that is due to the risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
In relation to those fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement and any gain or loss on the item that is being hedged is adjusted against its carrying amount and recognised in the income statement.
In relation to cash flow hedges forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments or highly probable forecast transactions and which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the proportion of the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the fair value of the hedging instrument that is deemed to be effective is recognised in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2008 51 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued When the firm commitment or highly probable forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the associated gains and losses that have previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the carrying amount of the asset or liability at the time the asset or liability is recognised.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which are cancelled due to termination of the underlying exposure, are taken to the income statement immediately.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Pensions In the United Kingdom, the Group operates two defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of employees.
These plans require contributions to be made to separately administered funds, based on triennial actuarial valuations.
Other plans are defined contribution in nature.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit pension plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost, and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligations, and is based on actuarial advice.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued, or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in present value of plan obligations resulting from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on plan assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received, and benefits paid during the year.
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds, less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover, by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
Contributions payable to the defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the year for which they are due.
Treasury shares Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held by the Group are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
Consideration received for the sale of Spirent Communications plc 52 Annual Report 2008 Financial statements 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued such treasury shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group, the revenue can be reliably measured and when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight line basis.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when there are no significant vendor obligations remaining.
It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer.
Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specific contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component.
To the extent that a separate component comprises a product sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above.
Revenue is recognised on other components as the Group fulfils its contractual obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to consideration.
Employee benefits When an employee has rendered services to the Group during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid in exchange for those services are recognised in the same accounting period.
Share-based payment Employees including executive directors of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using a binomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that will ultimately vest, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date and based on the best available estimates.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2008 53 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued The dilutive effect of outstanding share incentives is reflected in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
The Group took advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 Share-based Payment only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 which were unvested at 1 January 2005.
Tax Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Dividends paid The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period it is approved by the directors, and the final dividend in the period it is approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Critical accounting assumptions and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported.
Such estimates and assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events, actual results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates.
The areas requiring a high degree of judgement or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are discussed below.
Goodwill impairment The Group tests annually by cash-generating unit whether goodwill has suffered impairment and more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of estimates and assumptions.
These are described in note 15.
Spirent Communications plc 54 Annual Report 2008 Financial statements 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Defined benefit pension schemes The pension cost and the defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension plans are based on a number of selected assumptions, these include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth, longevity and expected return on the plans assets.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future periods.
The effect of changing these assumptions is described in note 11.
Revenue recognition For revenue recognition purposes contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component.
Management exercises a degree of judgement in setting the criteria used for determining when revenue which involves several elements should be recognised.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgement is applied in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions for which the final tax determinability is uncertain.
For example liabilities are recognised for anticipated tax audit issues based on whether additional taxes are likely to be due based on the facts and circumstances known at the time the financial statements are prepared.
Where the final outcome differs from the amounts that were initially recorded the differences will be recorded in the future period in which the determination is made.
Deferred taxes The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on current forecasts and estimates prepared by management.
A change to these forecasts and estimates could result in a different recognition outcome.
Provisions The Group records a provision for vacant property based on future rentals and reduced by its expected ability to sublease the vacant space to a third party and discounted where the effect is significant.
Changes in the actual outcome compared with expected outcome on subleasing or changes to expectations will be recorded in future periods.
New standards and interpretations not applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for the Group after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS Effective date IAS 1 revised Presentation of Financial Statements 1 January 2009 IAS 23 Borrowing Costs 1 January 2009 IAS 27 Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 1 July 2009 IAS 32 and IAS 1 Amendment to IAS 32 and IAS 1 Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation 1 January 2009 IAS 38 Amendment to IAS 38 Intangible Assets 1 January 2009 IFRS 2 Amendment to IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations 1 January 2009 IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations 1 July 2009 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 1 July 2008 IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate 1 January 2009 IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 1 October 2008 IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash assets to Owners 1 July 2009 IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers 1 July 2009 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2008 55 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued IFRS 8 Operating Segments will require disclosure of information about the Groups operating segments and replace the requirement to determine primary business and secondary geographical reporting segments of the Group.
The Group expects that the operating segments will remain the same as the business segments previously identified under IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Revenue 2008 2007 million million Sales of goods 219.6 202.8 Maintenance and support services 38.3 34.2 Total revenue from continuing operations 257.9 237.0 Revenues from discontinued operations principally related to sales of goods.
Segmental analysis The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
Business segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised on a worldwide basis into two operating groups, Communications and Systems.
Communications is further subdivided into two divisions, Performance Analysis and Service Assurance.
The SwissQual business, which was included in Performance Analysis, was sold in 2007 and was reported as a discontinued operation in that year.
There are no discontinued operations in 2008.
The principal activities of each segment are as follows: Performance Analysis division of the Communications group develops testing solutions for a broad range of communications technologies critical to the development of next-generation network equipment and devices.
Service Assurance division of the Communications group provides network monitoring and management systems for service providers to assure the quality of their high bandwidth data services.
Sales include hardware and software products as well as maintenance and support services.
Systems group comprises PG Drives Technology, which develops power control systems for electrical vehicles in the mobility and industrial markets.
Non-segmental costs represent corporate expenses, non-segmental assets comprise cash and cash equivalents held for central treasury purposes and other corporate assets and non-segmental liabilities represent tax payable and other corporate liabilities.

Pensions Defined benefit plans The defined benefit pension plans are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & Life Assurance Plan Staff Plan and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan Cash Plan.
These plans have been combined for the purposes of the following disclosures.
There is in addition a United Kingdom unfunded plan.
The assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are as follows: 2007 2008 restated million million Assets UK defined benefit pension plan surplus 2.6 6.1 Liabilities UK unfunded plan 0.6 0.7 The most recent actuarial valuations, at 1 April 2006, of the plans assets and the present value of the defined benefit plans obligations, using the projected unit credit method, have been used and updated by our independent actuaries.

Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the plans.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2008 63 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 11.
Pensions continued The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are such that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 21.7 years 2007 21.6 years if they are male and for a further 24.0 years 2007 24.0 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2028 at age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.9 years 2007 22.8 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 25.0 years 2007 25.0 years after retirement if they are female.
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum.
This would increase past service liabilities by 1.8 million.
Increasing the life expectancy of a current 65 year old by one year by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling factor.
This would increase past service liabilities by 3.1 million.
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan deficit recognised on 1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of 41.9 million in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension plans.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Groups statement of recognised income and expense before 1 January 2003.

Certain members, whose salaries were in excess of the statutory earnings cap, had their benefits increased through unapproved, unfunded arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of basic salary only.
The Group has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2008 of 0.6 million 2007 0.7 million.
This represents the actuarial value as confirmed by the Groups pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a market value basis in line with the main plan valuation and adjusted each year.
There are no experience gains or losses in the period from 2004 to 2008 on the unfunded plan.
Expected contributions for these plans for 2009 are 0.3 million.
A curtailment gain of 0.8 million arose in 2007 on the closure of a site which led to a reduction in the number of employees covered by the plans.
As the curtailment gain related to restructuring it was included within exceptional restructuring costs.
Defined contribution plans United Kingdom The Group maintains defined contribution pension plans for employees in the United Kingdom.
Employer contributions into these plans for 2008 were 0.7 million 2007 0.7 million.
United States The Group maintains a defined contribution pension benefit plan for employees of its United States subsidiaries.
This plan, also known as a 401 k Plan, allows employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement.
The investment choices offered by the plan are a selection of diversified mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return potential with varying levels of risk.
In aggregate, the Group contributions to the US plan totalled $3.1 million for 2008 2007 $3.5 million.
Total assets in the defined contribution plan at the end of 2008 were $89.4 million 2007 $129.2 million.
There were no defined benefit plans in the United States in 2008 or 2007.
Other jurisdictions Outside the United Kingdom and the United States employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in accordance with approved local practice and regulations.
These arrangements are defined contribution plans.
Total contributions for 2008 in respect of these plans amounted to 0.2 million 2007 0.5 million.
Total contributions to defined contribution plans were 2.6 million 2007 3.0 million.

Spirent Communications plc 70 Annual Report 2008 Financial statements 15.
Intangible assets continued Annual impairment test The recoverable amount of the Performance Analysis cash-generating unit at 30 November 2008, the annual impairment testing date, has been determined based on a value in use calculation using managements cash flow projections over a three year period.
Cash flows in subsequent years have been extrapolated using a 2.5 per cent 2007 2.5 per cent growth rate which approximates to the average long term growth rate for the industries in which this unit operates.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 21.0 per cent 2007 21.3 per cent.
The recoverable amount of this unit, calculated on a value in use basis, was in excess of its carrying value and consequently no impairment has been recognised.
Key assumptions for the annual impairment test The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation were: Revenue growth rates.
Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three year period covered by managements projections.
Projections were denominated in the same currency as the denomination of the goodwill balance to eliminate the effect of fluctuating exchange rates.
Revenue growth rates used in managements projections are based on managements estimate of growth in the markets served, taking into account the current economic uncertainties.
The cash flows used in the impairment review were approved by the Board.
Gross margins and operating expenses are based on historical values.
The discount rate applied to the cash flows is based on the risk free rate for ten year government bonds adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk associated with investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific cash-generating unit.
Long term growth rates are based upon industry analysis.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions At 30 November 2008, the date of the Groups annual impairment review, the estimated recoverable amount of the Performance Analysis cash-generating unit exceeded its carrying value by 36.2 million.
The table below shows the key assumptions used in the value in use calculation and the rate to which each must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying value.

Intangible assets continued In the impairment review carried out at 30 November 2007 the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value of the cash-generating unit by 138.2 million.
The directors believed that no reasonable possible change in any of the key assumptions used in isolation would have caused the carrying value of the Performance Analysis cash-generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk attributable to its trade receivables as the exposure is spread over a large number of customers.

Cash and cash equivalents continued Short term bank deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and one week 2007 one day and two months depending on the cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the short term deposit rates appropriate for the term of the deposit and currency.
In 2007 short dated commercial paper was also held, having a maturity of between one day and one month, and rated Standard & Poors A or Moodys A2 or better.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise the above amounts.
2008 2007 million million Non-current Cash on deposit 2.5 3.7 At 31 December 2008 2.5 million 2007 3.7 million is held in a blocked trust account and is only available for use by the Company once all creditors who were outstanding at the date of the cancellation of the share premium and capital redemption reserve, being 24 November 2004, are settled.

Other payables are non-interest bearing.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.
Deferred tax The movements in the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: million UK pension Temporary plan differences Tax losses surplus Total Deferred tax asset at 1 January 2007 0.2 1.0 1.2 Recognised in the year note 12 10.5 10.5 Charged in the year note 12 0.2 0.2 Deferred tax on UK pension plan surplus note 12 0.8 0.8 Disposal of operations note 34 0.2 0.2 Deferred tax asset at 1 January 2008 10.5 0.8 0.8 10.5 Recognised in the year note 12 0.8 3.3 2.5 Charged in the year note 12 2.3 0.5 2.8 Deferred tax on UK pension plan surplus note 12 0.3 0.3 Exchange adjustment 1.5 0.2 1.7 Deferred tax asset at 31 December 2008 8.9 3.8 0.5 12.2 Spirent Communications plc 74 Annual Report 2008 Financial statements 23.
Deferred tax continued A deferred tax asset of 12.2 million has been recognised at 31 December 2008 2007 10.5 million.
6.1 million is in the United Kingdom 2007 5.8 million and 6.1 million is in the United States 2007 4.7 million.
The deferred tax liability arising on the United Kingdom pension plan surplus in 2008 and 2007 has been offset as permitted by IAS 12 Income Taxes.
Movements have been charged to the statement of recognised income and expense in 2008 and 2007.
Deferred tax assets on temporary differences of 29.1 million 2007 56.2 million arising principally in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have not been recognised.
These assets can only be realised when they reverse against suitable taxable profits.
Although the directors ultimately expect to realise these assets, there is currently insufficient evidence under IAS 12 to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of these temporary differences.
In addition, the Group has tax losses arising in the United Kingdom of 80.3 million 2007 68.9 million in the United Kingdom and 28.6 million in the United States that are available for offset against suitable future taxable profits.
The United States tax losses unrecognised at 31 December 2007 have been reduced by 26.8 million following agreement of the tax position for prior years with the balance being utilised in the current year.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as their future recovery is uncertain.
United Kingdom tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
In total deferred tax assets amounting to 34.0 million 2007 50.1 million have not been recognised on unutilised losses and temporary differences.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the tax deduction which may be available on the future exercise of share incentives.

Provisions and other liabilities continued Provisions have been analysed as follows: 2008 2007 million million Current 3.7 5.1 Non-current 8.2 7.6 11.9 12.7 The lease provisions are for the continuing obligations under leases in respect of properties which have been vacated by the Group.
Where material, lease obligations are discounted.
The Group expects these provisions to be utilised over the next eight years.
Restructuring and other provisions at 31 December 2008 are mainly in relation to environmental provisions on property disposed of.
Derivative financial instruments The derivative financial instruments are forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts in the management of transactional exchange rate exposures.
These contracts are designated where possible as hedging instruments.
At 31 December 2008 the Group held various forward foreign currency exchange contracts in respect of the forward sale of US dollars against sterling on trading transactions.
Contracts for the sale of US dollars total 26.5 million 2007 29.7 million, are for various maturity dates over the period to 31 December 2009 at an average exchange rate of 1.76 2007 over the period to 31 December 2008 at an average rate of 2.03.
At 31 December 2007 there were also outstanding contracts for the purchase of US dollars against the euro which totalled 0.7 million at an average exchange rate of 1.41 which all matured before 31 December 2008.
These contracts have been designated as hedges at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
The fair value of the derivative financial instruments at 31 December is as follows: 2008 2007 million million Liabilities Liabilities Currency derivatives expected to be realised in less than one year Designated as a cash flow hedge 5.6 0.5 Gains and losses on cash flow hedges recycled into the income statement from equity are charged or credited to administration costs.
Spirent Communications plc 76 Annual Report 2008 Financial statements 27.
Financial instruments and financial risk management The main purpose of the Groups financial instruments, other than trade receivables, trade payables and provisions is to fund the Groups liquidity requirements.
All the Groups financial assets and liabilities are categorised as loans and receivables with the exception of the derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value.
These are shown in the following table.
2008 2007 million million Derivative Derivative Loans and financial Loans and financial receivables at instruments receivables at instruments amortised cost at fair value amortised cost at fair value Non-current cash on deposit note 21 2.5 3.7 Non-current other receivables note 20 2.2 1.4 Cash and cash equivalents note 21 59.7 79.0 Current trade and other receivables note 20 54.6 42.9 Financial assets 119.0 127.0 Non-current other payables note 24 1.3 1.1 Current trade and other payables note 22 15.4 12.8 Provisions note 25 11.9 12.7 Current derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting note 26 5.6 0.5 Financial liabilities 28.6 5.6 26.6 0.5 The Group enters into derivative transactions, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, for the management of the Groups currency exposures when deemed appropriate.
The key objective of the Group Treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to the Group.
All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework.
The Board has approved treasury policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities.
Additionally, it is the Groups policy that speculative treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.
a Market risk The main types of market risk that affect the Group are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.
Interest rate risk Following the repayment of its long term debt in February 2006 the Group has remained debt free with limited exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates.
The Groups excess funds are principally held in the United Kingdom and United States and invested in short term bank deposits.
It therefore has some exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in sterling and US dollar interest rates.
In 2007 the Group also invested in short dated commercial paper which all matured within one month.
Cash and cash equivalents, long term cash on deposit and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are the Groups financial instruments which are exposed to interest rate risk.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2008 77 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Short term bank deposits all mature within one week.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts all mature within one year.
The financial instruments bear the following interest rates: Effective Effective interest interest rate 2008 rate 2007 % million % million Fixed rate Fixed deposits 1.26 32.3 5.98 61.7 Short dated commercial paper 4.18 5.0 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 5.6 0.5 26.7 66.2 Floating rate Cash at bank and in hand 27.4 12.3 Interest rates on financial instruments classified as fixed rate are fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
All fixed rate deposits mature within one week 2007 two months after which date they will be exposed to floating rates of interest.
In addition, 2.5 million 2007 3.7 million was held in a blocked trust account and was earning interest of 1.75 per cent at 31 December 2008 2007 6.25 per cent.
The maturity of the deposit is less than one month, at maturity the interest rate will be reset.
This cash must be retained in the blocked trust account in accordance with the terms of the undertakings made at the time of the cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve the Cancellation in 2004.
The funds must remain in this account until all the creditors who existed at the date of the Cancellation have been repaid and therefore the maturity of this account is uncertain.
Interest receivable for the year was 3.1 million note 8 2007 6.1 million and is under the effective interest method.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above table are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
A movement of 100 basis points in interest rates based on levels of investment at 31 December 2008 would increase or reduce interest income and equity by 0.3 million 2007 0.7 million.
Exchange rate risk Currency exposures arise from trading transactions undertaken by the Group in foreign currencies and on the translation of the operating results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling but has significant operations in the United States, and its results can therefore be substantially affected on translation by movements in the US dollar to sterling exchange rate.
The Group does not enter into instruments to hedge the translation exposure of the operating results or net assets of its overseas subsidiaries since these are accounting and not cash exposures.
During the year, sterling has significantly weakened against the US dollar.
The Group does not have any net investment hedges in place.
A 10 per cent change in the US dollar to sterling exchange rate will have the following effect on the income statement and balance sheet compared with the reported exchange rate: 2008 2007 million million Income statement Profit before tax 5.0 3.0 Balance sheet Shareholders funds 10.0 7.0 Spirent Communications plc 78 Annual Report 2008 Financial statements 27.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The Group is not exposed to significant transactional foreign currency risk at 31 December 2008, nor at 31 December 2007, because the majority of its businesses do not enter into non-functional currency transactions.
Where such transactions do occur the Group enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts as appropriate.
Group Treasury, by means of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, carries out the majority of the transaction hedging activity in relation to normal trading activity.
At 31 December 2008 the Group had hedged the major part of its 2009 US dollar forecast trading exposures at an average exchange rate of 1.76 US dollars to sterling at 31 December 2007 at an average exchange rate of 2.03. b Credit risk Investment counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Board and as such short term deposits are limited to banks with a rating of Standard & Poors A or Moodys A2 or better.
There are pre-approved limits set for each bank to avoid any concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date under financial instruments in relation to bank deposits is equal to the carrying value of 34.8 million 2007 70.4 million, bank deposits and short dated commercial paper.
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for uncollectable amounts where appropriate.
Trade receivable exposures are managed in the business units where they arise.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk attributable to its trade receivables as the exposure is spread over a large number of customers with no one customer accounting for more than 10 per cent of total Group revenue.
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date in relation to trade receivables is equal to the carrying value of 52.2 million 2007 40.2 million.
The composition of trade receivables at 31 December is as follows: 2008 2007 million million Neither impaired nor past due 29.5 27.4 Past due but not impaired: Less than 30 days overdue 14.7 8.7 30 to 60 days 3.8 2.1 Over 60 days 4.2 2.0 Trade receivables 52.2 40.2 The Group closely monitors amounts due from customers and performs activities such as credit checks and review of payment history and has put in place appropriate credit approval limits.
Based on these procedures management assessed the quality of those receivables that are past due but not impaired as low risk.
The movement on the receivables provision during the year is given in note 20. c Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure that there are sufficient sources of funding to meet projected requirements.
Its operations are financed through cash and cash equivalents held centrally and cash generated from operations.
In addition the Group has a committed but currently undrawn borrowing facility for 25 million in place until September 2011.
This facility incurs commitment fees at market rates.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2008 79 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The facility requires that the following financial covenants are met: i The ratio of operating profit to net interest shall not be less than 5.00:1.00 ii The ratio of net debt to operating profit shall not be greater than 2.00:1.00 iii The ratio of net debt to shareholders funds shall not exceed 1.00:1.00 All three financial covenants have been complied with for the 12 months ended 31 December 2008.
At 31 December 2008 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of 59.7 million 2007 79.0 million all of which mature within one week 2007 two months.
During 2008 the Group generated 47.7 million of cash from operating activities 2007 49.8 million and considers that with current cash resources, positive cash flow from operating activities and a committed borrowing facility it has adequate resources available to it to remain in operational existence for the forseeable future.
The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts all of which mature within one year.
The gross settlement amounts of these contracts are as follows: 2008 2007 million million Sale of US dollars against sterling 26.5 29.7 Purchase of US dollars against euro 0.7 Gross settlement amounts 26.5 30.4 The Group is debt free and does not have loans payable.
Financial liabilities, other than derivative financial liabilities, are trade and other payables, the majority of which are all due to be settled within one year, and provisions see note 25.
The Group does not have any other material contractual commitments.
d Fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
e Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Groups capital is its total shareholders funds.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions.
During 2007 and 2008 the Company has been operating an on-market share repurchase programme.
In 2008 the Company repurchased 72.9 million of its Ordinary Shares 2007 103.4 million at a cost of 42.2 million 2007 66.8 million.
In 2008 the Company also undertook a tender offer for the purchase of Ordinary Shares in the Company which resulted in a further 52.9 million shares being repurchased at a cost of 24.8 million.
Operating lease commitments At 31 December, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2008 2007 million million Within one year 8.1 6.6 In the second to fifth years 17.8 15.2 Over five years 1.6 2.0 27.5 23.8 Spirent Communications plc 80 Annual Report 2008 Financial statements 28.
Operating lease commitments continued The Group leases certain land and buildings under non-cancellable operating lease agreements with a variety of terms.
The Group also leases certain plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
Total future sublease payments receivable relating to the above leases amounts to 1.2 million 2007 0.9 million.

All Ordinary Shares repurchased during the year were cancelled.
The remaining 48.4 million Ordinary Shares which were held in treasury were cancelled during the year leaving no Ordinary Shares in treasury as at 31 December 2008 2007 48.4 million.
For the purposes of providing comparative data, the issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company when treasury shares are taken into account and excluded from the calculation as at 31 December 2007 was 792.4 million Ordinary Shares compared with 671.8 million as at 31 December 2008.
In accordance with the rules of the following share plans, share incentives were exercised during the year which resulted in new Ordinary Shares being allotted by the Company or existing Ordinary Shares being transferred from either the Spirent Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT or Spirent Sharesave Trust SST as follows: Number of Consideration ordinary shares received million 000 2005 Employee Incentive Plan 0.4 24.0 Spirent Stock Incentive Plan 4.9 1,973.1 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 0.6 238.3 1 All employee share plans 0.3 125.9 6.2 2,361.3 Note 1 The all employee share plans are the UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme, the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, the US Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan and the UK Employee Share Purchase Plan see notes g to j on page 86.

Spirent Communications plc 82 Annual Report 2008 Financial statements 29.
Authorised and issued share capital continued The weighted average share price at exercise date was 73.9 pence 2007 75.9 pence.
No exercise price is payable on the vesting of a performance share.
2 These exercise prices relate to the Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan and are expressed in this table in sterling using the average exchange rate between pounds sterling and US dollars for the year.
The actual exercise prices of these options are priced at either 15.03 US cents or 20.03 US cents per share.
Description of employee share plans a 2005 Employee Incentive Plan EIP On 4 May 2005, Spirent shareholders approved the EIP to replace the now closed ESOS see c on page 84.
The EIP is currently available for selected employees including executive directors on a similar discretionary basis as the ESOS.
No price is payable on the grant of an award.
The Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, share settled stock appreciation rights SARs and performance shares under the EIP.
In normal circumstances, EIP options or SARs vest three years following grant provided the Companys earnings per share EPS growth targets have been met over the three year performance period.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2008 83 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29.
Authorised and issued share capital continued In normal circumstances, EIP performance shares vest three years following grant provided the Companys total shareholder return TSR targets have been met over the three year performance period.
For further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives please see Section 5 d of the Report on directors remuneration.
SARs granted under the EIP will deliver the appreciation value ie the aggregated increase in market value of an Ordinary Share over the base price of the SAR in the form of Ordinary Shares.
This SARs approach, which is also being utilised for the Spirent Stock Incentive Plan see note b below, helps the Company manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain and not the entire share value needs to be funded.
Using a SARs approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
2.2 million EIP SARs with an average base price of 50 pence were outstanding as at 31 December 2008 2007 1.9 million SARs outstanding, 52 pence average base price.
216,959 EIP SARs were exercised in 2008 resulting in the issue of 77,867 Ordinary Shares 2007 1,946 Ordinary Shares were issued on the exercise of 5,070 EIP SARs.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or been exercised.
b Spirent Stock Incentive Plan SSIP The SSIP was introduced in 2000.
This discretionary plan is primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally determined by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local market practice.
Under the SSIP, grants are also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
At the Annual General Meeting held in May 2008, shareholders approved the extension of the SSIP until the Companys 2009 Annual General Meeting.
The current shareholder approved mandate regarding the annual dilution rate is 0.5 per cent of the issued Ordinary Share capital for both the SSIP and EIP see a on page 83 in aggregate.
27.5 million SSIP SARs with an average base price of 56 pence were outstanding as at 31 December 2008 2007 34.4 million SARs outstanding, 58 pence average base price.
During 2008, 1.5 million Ordinary Shares were issued as a consequence of the exercise of 5.2 million SSIP SARs 2007 1.7 million Ordinary Shares resulted from the exercise of 6.7 million SSIP SARs.
Most awards made pursuant to the SSIP vest over four years, provided that the participant remains in employment.
Vesting is not subject to a performance condition.
Awards normally become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal proportions on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of grant will lapse.
The vesting of the SSIP awards made to Bill Burns, prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, and to certain other key senior managers within the Communications group, are subject to the Company meeting EPS growth targets over the vesting periods.
For further details on these performance conditions please see Section 5 d of the Report on directors remuneration.
No price is payable on the grant of options or SARs and no options or SARs have been, or can be, granted at a discount to the market price.
c 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS is now closed however outstanding options may still be exercised and has been replaced by the EIP referred to in a on page 83.
Spirent Communications plc 84 Annual Report 2008 Financial statements 29.
Authorised and issued share capital continued Awards under the ESOS, normally determined annually, were at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee after considering recommendations made to it by the Chief Executive Officer.
No price was payable on the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the ESOS were subject to the achievement of an EPS performance condition before they could be exercised.
During 2008, all remaining share options awarded under the ESOS passed their EPS performance conditions and are now exercisable until they expire on the tenth anniversary of their respective grant dates, or in the case of terminated participants 12 months from the date of termination, if sooner.
d Netcom Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan NARSOP Spirent completed the acquisition of Netcom Systems, Inc. Netcom in 1999.
$44.5 million of the total consideration was satisfied through the roll-over of outstanding options over Netcom shares into options over approximately 23.8 million Ordinary Shares as adjusted on substantially similar terms as previously existed.
All remaining outstanding options are fully vested and exercisable until they expire.
e Zarak Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan ZARSOP Out of a total consideration of approximately 44.9 million Ordinary Shares issued for the acquisition of Zarak Systems Corporation Zarak in 2000, approximately 3.8 million Ordinary Shares arose in connection with the roll-over of outstanding options over Zarak shares into options over Spirent Ordinary Shares on substantially similar terms as previously existed.
Any remaining outstanding ZARSOP options have a ten year life from the original date of grant.
f Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan CARSP Out of a total initial consideration for the acquisition of Caw Networks, Inc. Caw in 2002 of $49 million, approximately $4 million was in respect of Spirent Ordinary Shares and options which arose on the roll-over of outstanding options and shares under the previous Caw employee stock plan.
The options and shares vested over a period ending in 2006 on substantially similar terms as previously existed.
The options have a ten year life from the original date of grant.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement for Caw, an additional cash payment of 78.8 US cents was payable as each share vested or upon the exercise of a vested option.
Unvested rolled-over options were capable of immediate exercise ie prior to their respective vesting date and any shares arising from such an event were held in the ESOT until the relevant vesting date.
The option holder was entitled to the beneficial but not legal interest in the Ordinary Shares whilst they were held in the ESOT but they remained subject to forfeiture with the original option exercise prices being refunded to the participant if the participants employment was terminated prior to the vesting date.
All CARSP options and resulting Ordinary Shares held in the ESOT have now fully vested.
In accordance with the original terms for acquiring Caw, in March 2004 Spirent allotted 4.3 million Ordinary Shares and issued 75,000 options following the achievement by Caw of certain technical and financial earn out targets.
Participation in the CARSP entitled the participants to a share in the earn out.
Any earn out payment for an outstanding CARSP option was made by increasing the number of shares subject to the option and decreasing the per share exercise price so as to preserve the existing aggregate total exercise price.
Of the 4.3 million Ordinary Shares, 54,000 Ordinary Shares were issued to the ESOT in respect of unvested restricted shares, which remained subject to forfeiture prior to vesting.
As a result of the earn out, the additional cash payment referred to above was adjusted to 66.9 US cents as each share vested or upon the exercise of a vested option.
The Ordinary Shares subject to rolled-over options from the acquisition of Netcom, Zarak and Caw, or granted under the SSIP, do not count towards ABI scheme limits.
The plans mentioned in c to f above are closed to new entrants and no further awards of options can be made under them.

Authorised and issued share capital continued g UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS and the 2005 Sharesave Scheme The SRSOS closed in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Sharesave Scheme.
SRSOS options which remain outstanding may still be exercised prior to expiry, however no further grants can be made.
Both schemes operate as HMRC approved Save-As-You-Earn schemes and are open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
Any future sharesave invitations will be made under the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is broadly similar to the SRSOS.
The employee enters into a Save-As-You-Earn contract with the Companys savings carrier to save a regular sum of between 5 and 250 per month for a fixed period of either three or five years.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market closing price of an Ordinary Share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent, at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date, as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company operates the SST to honour the commitment to deliver Ordinary Shares against the exercise of outstanding options under the SRSOS.
Spirent Sharesave Trust Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent Communications plc, acts as sole trustee of the SST.
During the year, 0.3 million Ordinary Shares were transferred to participants 2007 0.6 million.
No invitations have been made under either of these schemes since 2003. h US Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP The ESPP enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Spirent American Depositary Shares using proceeds of a savings contract.
When joining the ESPP, participants enter into a contract to save up to 15 per cent of basic salary gross, subject to an individual maximum of $1,000 net per month, over a contract period of 12 months by way of regular payroll deductions.
No offer has been made under this plan since 2003. i Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan GAESPP The GAESPP was approved by shareholders in 2001 and offers employees in countries other than the UK or US an opportunity to share in the Companys performance through share ownership.
The GAESPP was implemented in Canada in January 2002 and operates on similar terms to the ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of basic salary gross, subject to an individual maximum of Cdn $1,000 net per month.
No offer has been made under this plan since 2003. j UK Employee Share Purchase Plan UK ESPP On 4 May 2005, shareholders approved the UK ESPP, which is based on an HMRC approved share incentive plan, available to all UK employees subject to a qualifying service period.
The UK ESPP offers three ways to provide Ordinary Shares to employees: free shares, partnership shares and matching shares.
The UK ESPP will operate in conjunction with a trust, which will hold the shares on the behalf of participants.
To date, no awards have been made under this plan.

Authorised and issued share capital continued k Stock Appreciation Rights Plan SARP The SARP was introduced in September 1999 as an interim incentive arrangement for the employees of Netcom following the closure of the NARSOP described in d on page 85 and subsequently for certain other employees in the Communications group.
Under the SARP, recruitment, promotion and recognition awards over Ordinary Shares have been made in line with historic and local market practice.
The operation of the SARP reflected as far as practicable the NARSOP.
Accordingly, rights under the SARP vested over four years, 25 per cent vesting one year after the date of grant and the remainder vesting on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Rights granted were not subject to the fulfilment of any performance conditions.
The SARP will deliver the appreciation value ie the aggregated increase in the market value of an Ordinary Share over the rights price in the form of existing Ordinary Shares which have been purchased in the market by the Companys ESOT.
The SARP is closed and no further grants can be made under it.
At 31 December 2008, the following rights were outstanding under the SARP: 2008 2007 Number of Number of rights rights Rights price outstanding outstanding Rights exercise dates pence million million 10.09.0029.06.10 182416 1.5 1.6 30.

The fair value of share incentives is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model.
The following table gives the assumptions made in arriving at the share-based payment charge: 2008 2007 Weighted average share price pence 41.0 56.0 Weighted average fair value pence 31.0 28.0 Expected volatility % 4045 4050 Expected life years 4.5 4.5 Risk free rate % 3.74.9 4.75.3 Dividend yield % 2.0 nil Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2008 87 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30.
Share-based payment continued The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous two years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For performance shares granted under the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan, which have a market based performance condition, it has been assumed that there will be 30 per cent vesting for valuation purposes.
