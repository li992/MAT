Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Critical accounting judgements Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in the Statement of Consolidated Accounting Policies, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised for certain long-term project-based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity.
This is measured by the proportion of costs incurred to estimated contract costs except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to calculate present values.
The carrying value of goodwill is 147.6m 2007: 52.3m at the balance sheet date.
Intangible and tangible assets Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill and tangible fixed assets are amortised or depreciated over their useful lives.
Useful lives are based on managements estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness.
Due to the long lives of assets, changes to the estimates used can result in significant variations in the carrying value.
The Group assesses the impairment of tangible and intangible fixed assets subject to amortisation or depreciation whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include the following: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results: significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business: and significant negative industry or economic trends.
Intangible assets are valued on the following key assumptions, useful lives, managements cash flow forecasts and applying a pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% weighted average cost of capital.

Following the impairment test no impairment to the carrying values is required.
The cash generating units are considered to be the Social Housing and Compliance divisions which at 31 August 2008 have goodwill of 32.9m and 114.7m respectively.
Goodwill is reviewed annually or when other events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
The recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions in these calculations are: The achievement of budgeted operating profit The achievement of growth in market share The estimation of terminal values The estimation of discount rates The forecasts are based on approved budgets and strategic plans for the next 5 years.
Subsequent cash flows have been increased in line with the expected growth.
The cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.5% 2007: 10.4%.
No impairment charges were recognised in 2008 2007: nil.

Included in the amounts receivable on contracts within the ageing profile is both amounts receivable held under current and non-current assets respectively.
Other receivables are excluded from the above analysis and have been treated as not yet due 3.4m 2007: 0.3m.
Amounts recoverable on contracts represent the estimated amounts which have been earned, or which valuation under the terms of the respective contracts have not yet been agreed with the customers.
These amounts have been included at their estimated recoverable values.
Included within accounts not yet due is 12.6m 2007: 5.1m which reflects accounts which are recoverable over the period of the contracts to which they relate.
Accounts which are over 6 months overdue and are still to be agreed by the customers are prudently valued at their estimated written down recoverable value.
Amounts not due represent contractual commitments which are not due for payment.
Amounts classified as past due represent the amounts that are due for payment but for which payment has not been received.
Impaired amounts represent the net amount that is expected to be recovered, after making prudent provision for any items that are still subject to negotiation.
The credit risk is managed on an overall group basis.
The customers are largely local authorities and other large blue chip organisations.
The credit exposure is regarded as low risk given the nature of the customers and spread of customer contracts which minimise concentration risk.

The Group has provided the OFT with a response to the Statement of Objections and is fully co-operating with the OFT.
The Statement of Objections relates to three contracts dated between 2000 and 2003 and does not refer to current trading.
At the present time the Group has not received a decision from the OFT and therefore an assessment of any financial impact is not possible.
An unlimited bank multilateral guarantee exists between the Company and other Group Companies.
At the year end the Group had loans totalling 120.2m 2007: 37.9m.
The Group has guaranteed the performance bonds of its subsidiary companies of 12.3m 2007: 10.3m.
24 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Groups financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources, borrowings, loans, loan notes and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The Groups policy is to finance its operations through retained earnings and borrowings, placing surplus cash on short term deposit.
Group management has responsibility for reducing exposure to financial risk and for ensuring that adequate funds are available to meet anticipated requirements.
It operates according to the policies and guidelines established by the Board.
Cash management is carried out centrally.
Where necessary, borrowings are raised centrally to provide adequate funds for the operating subsidiaries.
The principal risk arising from the Groups financial instruments relates to interest rates and liquidity.
The Groups borrowing facilities are drawn on as required to manage its cash needs.
Banking facilities are reviewed regularly and extended and replaced in advance of their expiry.

indb 77 5 11 08 11:24:43 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 24 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities continued During the year the Group entered into an interest rate hedging facility with the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The facility consists of a 45m Vanilla Swap and a 15m Extendable Collar.
The facilities are based on 60m of core debt which is in the Directors view a significant element of the core long-term debt of the Group.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
The method of recognising any resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Included as a credit within the consolidated income and expense account is a gain from hedging activities of 0.3m 2007: nil, which is not considered to be material for further disclosure.
The gain has been included within other trade receivables.
Cash-flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash-flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Groups initial hedging facility with RBS Royal Bank of Scotland became active on 18 February 2008.
At 31 August 2008, the Group had net borrowings.
It had no financial assets other than amounts recoverable on contracts, trade receivables, hedging facility and cash at bank.
The fair value of trade receivables and payables approximated to their book value.

The difference remaining between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the net assets represents a combination of the workforce acquired and future expected cash created from the expected synergistic benefits the acquisitions will provide to the Group in addition to that generated from existing customer relationships.
The value of such intangible assets is not separately identifiable and therefore has been treated as goodwill.
Finalisation of fair value adjustments relating to prior year acquisition The provisional fair values attributed to the tangible assets and liabilities were re-assessed at the anniversary date of the acquisition.

On this occasion the contracts were not capable of being assigned and therefore the fair value has been adjusted accordingly.
This possibility had been reflected in the consideration paid for the acquisition and, therefore, no diminution in the value of goodwill has arisen.
