These Standards and Interpretations may require additional disclosure in future financial statements.
The Company has early adopted the amendment made to IAS 28 through the 2008 Annual Improvements Project applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 in relation to disclosures for investments in associates accounted for at fair value in accordance with IAS 39. b Going concern As described in note 9, should the average 12 month discount of the share price of any class exceed 5% of net asset value per share, the Company is obliged to offer a continuation vote to class shareholders.
As at the balance sheet date, none of the Companys three share classes had triggered the discount management provisions.
However, both the Euro and US Dollar share classes triggered the provision after the balance sheet date and it is expected that the Sterling Class will trigger in the near future.
There is a material uncertainty as to whether any or all classes of shareholder would vote to discontinue their share class which may cast a significant doubt about the likelihood of the Company to continue as a going concern.
Notwithstanding such uncertainty, the financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis because on the basis of their present assessment the expectations of the Directors are that the Company will continue for the foreseeable future.
If it were expected that classes of shareholders would vote to discontinue their share class, the financial statements would be prepared on a break up basis.
Subject to the matters referred to in note 14 c, no adjustments would be required to the carrying amounts of the investments or other net asset, but a provision would be required for the costs of winding up the Company.
The directors estimate these costs would be immaterial relative to the NAV of the Company.
c Taxation The Company has been granted exemption under the Income Tax Exempt Bodies Guernsey Ordinance, 1989 from Guernsey Income Tax, and is charged an annual fee of 600. d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Interest income Interest income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
49 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2008 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued f Share issue costs The share issue costs incurred during the year in relation to the issue of C shares amounted to 864,114 in the Sterling share class, 19,300 in the Euro share class and $95,450 in the US Dollar share class.
Because the Companys ordinary shares have no fixed redemption date the costs are recognised in the statement of changes in equity.
g Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are defined as call deposits and, short term deposits readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, together with bank overdrafts.
For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and deposits at bank, together with bank overdrafts.
h Investments All investments are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are initially recognised on the date of purchase at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given, excluding transaction costs associated with the investment, with unrealised gains and losses on investments and impairment of investments recognised in the Statement of Operations.
Investments are derecognised on disposal.
Realised gains or losses are determined on the disposal of investments and unrealised gains or losses are determined based on the change in value of investments since the prior period.
In order to assess whether any impairment of the unquoted investments has occurred and in order to determine the recoverable amount of the unquoted investments, the Directors consider the net asset value of the underlying investment in AllBlue Limited.
The Companys net asset value is based on valuations of unquoted investments.
In calculating the net asset value and the net asset value per Share, the Administrator relies on net asset values of the shares in AllBlue Limited supplied by the administrator of AllBlue Limited.
Those net asset values are based on the market value of the various investments held by AllBlue Limited.
i Foreign currency translation The financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the Statement of Operations.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising on currency consolidation due to translation of foreign currency balances to presentation currency are taken to the Statement of Operations.
50 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2008 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued j Segment information In the opinion of the directors, the Company has only one business and geographical segment, being investment in three share classes of a fund of hedge funds incorporated in the Cayman Islands.
k Shares Sterling, Euro and US Dollar shares have been reclassified as liabilities in accordance with IAS 32 because the Company as a whole does not have the power to determine the outcome of the continuation votes by share class under the discount management provisions of the articles described in note 9.
This represents a change from prior accounting periods and has no effect on either the individual share class profit or loss for the year or amount of net assets attributable to shareholders.
The Directors have been advised that this treatment does not result in the shares being treated as a liability for the purpose of applying the solvency test set out in Section 527 of the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
During the year under review, 733,332 2007: 997,774 of costs were incurred with this service provider.

All of the C shares issued were fully paid These shares were issued under terms that stated that the Company could, at its discretion, redeem all or any of the C shares by agreement with the holders and at a price agreed between the Company and the C shareholders.
The C shares were converted to Ordinary shares on 4 September 2008 as shown on the previous page.
A conversion ratio was applied based on the relevant Net Asset Values of each share class on that date.
The new Ordinary Shares ranked pari passu with the Ordinary Shares then in issue.
In the event of a return of capital on a winding-up or otherwise, shareholders are entitled to participate in the distribution of capital after paying all the debts and satisfying all the liabilities attributable to the relevant share class.
The holders of shares of the relevant share class shall be entitled to receive by way of capital any surplus assets of the share class in proportion to their holdings.
In the event that the share class has insufficient funds or assets to meet all the debt and liabilities attributable to that share class, any such shortfall shall be paid out of funds or assets attributable to the other share classes in proportion to the respective net assets of the relevant share classes as at the date of winding-up.
The Companys Articles incorporate a discount management provision which applies to each class of Ordinary Shares individually that will require a continuation vote to be proposed in respect of the particular class of Ordinary Shares at a class meeting of the relevant Shareholders by way of ordinary resolution if, over the previous 12 month rolling period commencing from 1 January 2008, the relevant class of Ordinary Shares has traded, on average calculated by averaging the closing mid-market share price on the dates which are 5 Business Days after the date on which each estimated Published NAV announcement is made for each NAV Calculation date over the period at a discount in excess of 5 per cent to the average Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share of that class calculated by averaging the NAV per Ordinary Share of that class as at the NAV Calculation Date at the end of each month during the period.
In the event that a vote to continue is proposed and passed for any class of Ordinary Shares as a result of the operation of such mechanism, no further continuation vote will be capable of being proposed for that class for a further 12 months.
If such continuation vote is not passed, the Directors will be required to formulate redemption proposals to be put to the Shareholders of that class offering to redeem 57 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2008 9 SHARE CAPITAL continued their Ordinary Shares at the relevant Published Net Asset Value on the NAV Calculation Date immediately preceding such redemption less the costs of all such redemptions.
However, where one or more such resolutions in respect of the same period is are not passed and the class es of Ordinary Shares involved represent 75 per cent, or more of the Companys net assets attributable to all Ordinary Shares at the last NAV Calculation Date on or immediately preceding the date of the latest continuation resolution being defeated, the Directors may first at their discretion put forward alternative proposals to all Shareholders to offer to repurchase their Shares or to reorganise, reconstruct or wind up the Company.
If, however, such alternative proposals are not passed by the necessary majority of shareholders of the relevant class, the Directors must proceed to offer to redeem the relevant class es of Ordinary Shares on the terms described above.
Where following redemption of any class of Ordinary Shares under the discount management provision, the number of Ordinary Shares of that class remaining in issue represent less than 25 per cent, of the Ordinary Shares of that class in issue immediately before such redemption or the listing for such class of Ordinary Shares on the Official List is withdrawn or threatened to be withdrawn or the Directors determine that the conditions for the continued listing of that class are not or they believe will not be met, then the Company may redeem the remaining issued Ordinary Shares of that class within 3 months of such determination at a redemption price equal to the Net Asset Value of Ordinary Shares of that class on the NAV Calculation Date selected by the Directors for such purpose less the costs of such redemption.

Thereafter the Board recognises that the Company has via its holding of shares in AllBlue Limited an indirect exposure to the risks summarised below though it must be noted that there is little or nothing which the Board can do to manage each of these risks within AllBlue Limited AllBlue or the underlying funds in which AllBlue invests the underlying fund s. a Price Risk The success of AllBlues and the underlying funds and, therefore, the Companys activities will be affected by general economic and market conditions, such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws, trade barriers, currency exchange controls and national and international political circumstances.
These factors may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity of the underlying funds investments.
Volatility or illiquidity could impair the underlying funds profitability or result in losses.
Details of the Companys Investment Objectives and Policy are given on page 1.
60 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2008 14 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued Price sensitivity The Company invests substantially all its assets in AllBlue and does not undertake any significant borrowing or hedging activity at the Company level.
Its performance is therefore directly linked to the net asset value of AllBlue, which itself is driven by the net asset values of the underlying funds, each of which hold a large number of positions in listed and unlisted securities.
At 31 December 2008, if the net asset value of AllBlue had been 10% higher with all other variables held constant, the net gain attributable to shareholders for the year would have been 28,141,240 2007: 16,103,265 greater, arising due to the increase in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
If the net asset value of AllBlue had been 10% lower with all other variables held constant, the net gain attributable to shareholders for the year would have been 28,141,240 2007: 16,103,265 lower, arising due to the decrease in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The sensitivity is higher in 2008 than in 2007 because of an increase in the net financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss at the balance sheet date.
b Credit Risk The nature of commercial arrangements made in the normal course of business between many prime brokers and custodians means that in the case of any one prime broker or custodian defaulting on its obligations to AllBlue or any of the underlying funds, the effects of such a default may have negative effects on other prime brokers with whom AllBlue or such underlying fund deals.
The underlying funds and, by extension, AllBlue and the Company may, therefore be exposed to systemic risk when AllBlue or an underlying fund deals with prime brokers and custodians whose creditworthiness may be interlinked.
The assets of AllBlue and the underlying funds may be pledged as margin with prime brokers or other counterparties or held with prime brokers or banks.
In the event of the default of any of these prime brokers, banks or counterparties, AllBlue or the underlying funds may not receive back all or any of the assets pledged or held with the defaulting party.
The maximum credit risk to which the Company was exposed at the year end was 281,412,397 2007: 161,032,653.
The main concentration of risk for the Company relates to the investments in AllBlue, as these are the only investments the Company has.
c Liquidity Risk In some circumstances, investments may be relatively illiquid making it difficult to acquire or dispose of them at the prices quoted on the various exchanges.
Accordingly, an underlying funds ability to respond to market movements may be impaired and, consequently, the underlying fund may experience adverse price movements upon liquidation of its investments which may in turn affect the value of AllBlue and hence the Companys investment in AllBlue.
Settlement of transactions may be subject to delay and administrative formalities.
61 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2008 14 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued c Liquidity Risk continued There can be no assurance that the liquidity of the investments of AllBlue and the underlying funds will always be sufficient to meet redemption requests as, and when, made.
Any such lack of liquidity may affect the ability of the Company to realise its shares in AllBlue and the value of Shares in the Company.
For such reasons AllBlues treatment of redemption requests may be deferred in exceptional circumstances including if a lack of liquidity may result in difficulties in determining the net asset value and the net asset value per share in AllBlue.
This in turn would limit the ability of the Directors to realise the Companys investments in AllBlue should they consider it appropriate to do so and may result in difficulties in determining the net asset value of a Share in the Company.
The market prices, if any, for such illiquid investments tend to be volatile and may not be readily ascertainable and the relevant underlying fund may not be able to sell them when it desires to do so or to realise what it perceives to be their fair value in the event of a sale.
The size of the underlying funds positions may magnify the effect if a decrease in market liquidity for such instruments.
Changes in overall market leverage, deleveraging as a consequence of a decision by the counterparties with which the underlying funds enter into repurchase reverse repurchase agreements or derivative transactions, to reduce the level of leveraging, or the liquidation by other market participants of the same or similar positions, may also adversely affect the underlying funds portfolios.
The sale of restricted and illiquid securities often requires more time and results in higher brokerage charges or dealer discounts and other selling expenses than does the sale of securities eligible for trading on national securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter markets.
The underlying funds may not be able readily to dispose of such illiquid investments and, in some cases, may be contractually prohibited from disposing of such investments for a specified period of time.
Restricted securities may sell at a price lower than similar securities that are not subject to restrictions on resale.
The Companys shares in issue are traded on the London Stock Exchange LSE.
However, in certain circumstances there may be a limited market for the shares and it may not be possible for investors to achieve liquidation of their holding within a short time period or for the investor to realise the full anticipated value of the shares.
The Company has the use of an overdraft facility in order to settle share redemptions at times when no cash funds are available.
d Interest Rate Risk The prices of securities tend to be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.
Unexpected fluctuations in interest rates could cause the corresponding prices of long positions and short positions adopted to move in directions which were not originally anticipated.
In addition, interest rate increases generally increase the interest or carrying costs of investments.
The Companys own cash balances are not materially exposed to interest rate risk as cash and cash equivalents are held on floating interest rate deposits with banks and the Company does not rely on income from bank interest to meet day to day expenses.
62 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2008 14 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued e Leverage by Underlying Funds Certain underlying funds in which the Company may have an economic interest operate with a substantial degree of leverage and are not limited in the extent to which they either may borrow or engage in margin transactions.
The positions maintained by such underlying funds may in aggregate value be in excess of the net asset value of AllBlue.
This leverage presents the potential for a higher rate of total return but will also increase the volatility of AllBlue and, as a consequence, the Company, including the risk of a total loss of the amount invested.
f Capital management The investment objective of the Company is to provide shareholders with consistent long-term capital growth through an investment policy of investing substantially all of its assets in AllBlue Limited AllBlue or any successor vehicle to AllBlue.
As the Companys Ordinary Shares are traded on the LSE, the Ordinary Shares may trade at a discount to their Net Asset Value per Share.
However, in structuring the Company, the Directors have given detailed consideration to the discount risk and how this may be managed.
At the last annual general meeting, the Directors were granted authority to buy back up to 14.99 per cent of the Ordinary Shares in issue.
The Companys authority to make purchases of its own issued Ordinary Shares will expire at the conclusion of the next general meeting of the Company.
A renewal of such authority to make purchases of Ordinary Shares will be sought at the next Shareholder meeting of the Company.
The timing of any purchases will be decided by the Board.
The Directors intend that purchases will only be made pursuant to this authority through the market, for cash, at prices below the prevailing Net Asset Value per Share where the Directors reasonably believe such purchases will result in an increase in the Net Asset Value per Share of the remaining Ordinary Shares.
Following approval of the Court in Guernsey, the Company resolved to cancel the amount standing to the credit of its share premium account following Admission.
The amount released on cancellation has been credited as a distributable reserve in the books of account and may be used by the Company for the purpose of funding purchases of its Ordinary Shares as described above and the payment of dividends.
The Companys authorised share capital is such that further issues of new Ordinary Shares could be made.
Subject to prevailing market conditions, the Board may decide to make one or more further such issues or reissues of Ordinary Shares for cash from time to time.
Any further issues of new Ordinary Shares or reissues of Ordinary Shares held in treasury will rank pari passu with Ordinary Shares in issue.
There are no provisions of the Companies Laws which confer rights of pre-emption in respect of the allotment of Shares.
There are, however, pre-emption rights contained in the Articles, but the Directors have been granted the power to issue further Shares on a non-pre-emptive basis until the time of the Companys annual general meeting in 2009 by a special resolution of Shareholders dated 30 May 2008.
The Directors intend to request that the authority to allot Shares on a non-pre-emptive basis is renewed at each subsequent annual general meeting of the Company 63 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2008 Unless authorised by Shareholders, the Company will not issue further Ordinary Shares or reissue Ordinary Shares out of treasury for cash at a price below the prevailing Net Asset Value per Share unless they are first offered pro rata to existing Shareholders.
The Company monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity as presented on the face of the balance sheet.
Capital for the reporting period under review is summarised as follows: 2008 2007 GBP GBP Purchase of own shares 483,079 202,023 Retained earnings 282,638,651 161,070,163 Total 282,155,572 160,868,140 64
