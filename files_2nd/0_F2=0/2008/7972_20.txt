The principal funds are held in the UK and are final salary dened benefit pension schemes.
Most of the schemes have assets held in trust in separately administered funds although there are some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical plans in respect of past employees.
There are no material dened contribution schemes in the UK.
The majority of the overseas dened benefit schemes are final salary schemes which provide a lump sum on retirement, some of which have assets held in trust in separately administered funds and others which are unfunded.
The overseas dened contribution schemes are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
a. UK schemes The UK has four main dened benefit schemes, namely the Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme.
These schemes are considered below: Open schemes Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2006 on a market-related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualied actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The majority of the schemes liabilities are for pensioners and deferred pensioners, and the investment strategy is to hold a broadly balanced portfolio of equities and bonds.
Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2006 on a market-related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualied actuaries based on the projected unit method.
Whilst a majority of the schemes members are pensioners and deferred pensioners, a sizeable portion of the membership is still accruing benets and the investment strategy reects this with the majority of the assets invested in equities.
Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme This scheme is managed from Guernsey and is therefore reported in the United Kingdom segment in this note.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2006 and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualied actuaries based on the projected unit method.
A significant majority of the schemes members are pensioners and deferred pensioners and therefore the majority of the assets are invested in bonds.
Closed scheme TKM Group Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2007 on a market-related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualied actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The scheme has a prudent investment strategy and, as at 31 December 2008, invested 69% of assets in bonds, cash or gilts.
Approximately half the members are pensioners and half are deferred pensioners and as such no further pension accrual arises.
Overseas schemes There are a number of smaller dened benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement Scheme in Hong Kong.
In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee.
These schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.
c. Dened contribution plans The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement is 5.5m 2007 3.6m.
There are no outstanding contributions to dened contribution schemes at the year end 2007 0.1m.
d. Dened benefit plans As the Groups principal dened benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately to the overseas schemes.
For the purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Groups material schemes and these updates are reected in the amounts reported below.
