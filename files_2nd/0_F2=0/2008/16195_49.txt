Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 17.
Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering both its underlying oil and gas businesses.
In addition, the Group holds a small portfolio of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The Group considers the carrying value of all the financial assets and liabilities to be materially the same as the fair value.
The Group has no material financial assets that are past due.
Fair values of derivative instruments Under IAS 39 all derivatives must be recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet with changes in such fair value between accounting periods being recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.
The fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Fair values are determined using quoted market prices marked-to-market values where available.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The Groups derivative instrument book and fair values were as follows: Less than One to three Total Less than One to three Total one year years 2008 one year years 2007 Assets liabilities : 000 000 000 000 000 000 Cash flow hedges Gas derivatives 5,666 5,161 10,827 7,573 13,489 21,062 Oil derivatives 26,523 35,662 62,185 81,832 55,046 136,878 Interest rate derivatives 868 1,221 2,089 104 104 19,989 29,280 49,269 89,509 68,535 158,044 Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Oil and gas prices The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying oil and gas revenues.
Such commodity derivatives will tend to be priced using pricing benchmarks, such as Brent Dated, D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil and gas revenues respectively.
The Group hedges its estimated oil and gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its oil revenues from substantially all of its African oil interests and its gas revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
At 31 December 2008, the Groups oil hedge position was summarised as follows: Oil hedges H1 2009 H2 2009 2010 2011 14,414 14,000 6,500 1,000 Volume bopd 59.68 60.42 78.80 69.40 Average Price $ bbl Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2008 and represent the current value of hedged volumes at that date.
At 31 December 2008, the Groups gas hedge position was summarised as follows: Gas hedges H1 2009 H2 2009 2010 2011 Volume mmscfd 64.4 44.4 17.8 3.7 Average Price p therm 57.74 54.30 56.94 63.16 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2008 and represent the current value of hedged volumes at that date.
As at 31 December 2008, all of the Groups oil and gas derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups oil and gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using regression analysis on oil and ratio analysis on gas.
There is, however, a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
There is also a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges which arise from, among other factors, field production performance on any day.

Financial instruments continued Financial derivatives The Group internally measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses, including utilising 10% favourable and adverse changes in the key variables.
Oil and gas sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being Dated Brent oil prices and UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas prices.
The sensitivity analysis, which is used internally by management to monitor financial derivatives, has been prepared using the following assumptions: the pricing adjustments relate only to the point forward mark-to-market MTM evaluations: the price sensitivities assume there is no ineffectiveness related to the oil and gas hedges: and the sensitivities have been run only on the intrinsic element of the hedge as management consider this to be the material component of the MTM oil and gas hedges.
As at 31 December 2008, a 10% increase in the dated Brent oil price curve would have decreased equity by approximately 22 million 2007: 49 million, a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately 27 million 2007: 43 million.
As at 31 December 2008, a 10% increase in the UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas price curves would have decreased equity by approximately 10.5 million 2007: 14 million, a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately 10.3 million 2007: 12 million.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis As at 31 December 2008, the interest rate derivative position was out-of-the-money to an amount of 2.1 million 2007: 104,000 and due to immateriality no sensitivity analysis has been performed on the position.
FX sensitivity analysis As at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007, there were no foreign exchange derivatives outstanding.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The primary activities of the Group are oil and gas exploration and production.
The Group has a credit policy that governs the management of credit risk, including the establishment of counterparty credit limits and specific transaction approvals.
The Group limits credit risk by assessing creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their credit worthiness after transactions have been initiated.
The Group attempts to mitigate credit risk by entering into contracts that permit netting and allow for termination of the contract upon the occurrence of certain events of default.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The maximum financial exposure due to credit risk on the Groups financial assets, representing the sum of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative assets, trade receivables and other current assets, as at 31 December was 490.2 million 2007: 207.4 million.
