Share-based payments Share options Shar e options are granted to executive directors and senior management based on performance criteria.
The scheme rules are described in the Directors Remuneration Report and repeated below.
All share-based payments are equity settled.
At 31st December 2008, there were outstanding options under various employee share option schemes, exercisable during the years 2009 to 2018, to acquire 2,022,251 2007: 2,271,500 shares of the Company at prices ranging from 0.1675 to 4.54 per share 2007: 0.1675 to 3.83.
The vesting period of the options is 3 years, with an exercise period of 7 years, making a 10 year maximum term.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average prices WAEP of, and movements in, share options during the year.
2008 2008 2007 2007 No WAEP No WAEP 1 Outstanding as at 1st January 2,271,500 151.21p 3,629,531 89.47p Granted during the year 310,000 454.00p 367,000 298.00p 2 Exercised during the year 559,249 82.51p 1,725,031 70.61p Outstanding at 31st December 2,022,251 205.75p 2,271,500 151.21p Exercisable at 31st December 901,250 60.03p 692,500 40.94p 1 Included within this balance are options over 202,500 2007: 396,531 shares for which an income statement expense has not been recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as the options were granted on or before 7th November 2002.
These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
For the share options outstanding as at 31st December 2008, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 1.242 years 2007: 1.45 years.
During the year share options were granted in accordance with The New Approved Share Option Scheme and the New Unapproved Share Option Scheme collectively the New Share Option Schemes that were introduced in 2001.
They reflect the best practice aspects recommended by the Association of British Insurers following the publication of their guidelines in March 2001 the ABI Guidelines.
For the options to vest there has to be an increase in Share Price combined with a comparison to an external benchmark the Financial Times Stock Exchange Oil & Gas Producers Index FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index.
As a result of an increase in share price in the first quarter of 2006 the Company moved up into the FTSE 250 Index FTSE 250 and the benchmark was therefore reviewed and the Remuneration Committee decided that the higher of the FTSE 250 Index or the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index was the most appropriate.
The Rules of the New Share Option Schemes address eligibility, timing of grants and exercise of options etc, and require that the shareholders be consulted if any substantive amendments to the Rules are required.
The Remuneration Committee Committee has discretion as to the application of the Rules of the New Share Option Schemes, particularly in the level of awards and the setting of the level of Performance Conditions.
The Committee has prepared internal guidelines to enable it to administer the New Share Option Schemes.
In awarding share options the Committee take into account the ABI Guidelines in terms of individual and collective limits, the need for demanding Performance Conditions etc, and other factors such as the performance of the Company and the individual in the previous 12 months, the effect of the vesting of grants awarded in previous years e. g. dilution, cost to the Company and the overall remuneration level annual salary, bonus award and benefits of the individual relative to the market.
Grants are made by reference to the market value mid market price of the Companys shares under option at the time of grant.
Executive Directors and employees are not required to pay for the grant of share options.
After three years the number of options that can be exercised is determined by two factors: 1 the actual increase in the Companys Share Price: and 2 a comparison of the actual increase in the Share Price to the change in the FTSE FI until the end of June 2004, FTSE SI until the end of February 2006 and the higher of the FTSE 250 Index or the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index after that date.
82 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the accounts continued 20.
Share-based payments continued The Share Price and FTSE Factors will be multiplied together and the resultant figure will be applied to the number of options granted to an individual to determine the number of options to be vested.
The structure has been designed to introduce a sliding scale as distinct from a specific individual benchmark.
It will require the share price to double and this increase to be in the top quartile of the growth in the FTSE FI SI Oil & Gas Producers Index for all of the awards granted to an individual to determine the number of options that vest.
To encourage the retention of key staff, the Committee has determined that an option holder will only be able to exercise up to 50% of vested options at any one time and up to 50% after a period of 12 months, unless determined otherwise by the Committee.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 72.35p 2007: 58.8p.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a variant of the standard binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options are granted, which includes the performance condition related to the Companys share price directly.
The performance condition based on performance relative to other companies is modelled with a Monte Carlo model.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 31st December 2008 and 31st December 2007.
The expected future volatility has been determined by reference to the historical volatility.
2008 2007 Dividend yield % 1.00 0.60 Historical volatility % 42.00 45.50 Expected share price volatility % 42.00 45.50 Risk free interest rate % 3.95 5.10 Expected life of option years 4.75 4.75 Weighted average share price pence 205.75p 151.21p Bonus scheme The performance criteria of the Directors and senior employees bonus payments includes a component that relates directly to JKXs share performance over the vesting period and a component which relates to the performance of JKX share price in relation to the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index.
The full details of the bonus performance criteria are explained in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 49 and 50.
The bonus accrued for 2008 was $0.7m 2007: $1.4m and was paid in January 2009.
