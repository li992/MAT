Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 26.
Called-up share capital Capital Structure continued The Groups management remains committed to delivering and enhancing shareholder value, and building upon the progress made during recent years.
The Board continues to believe that this can best be achieved by investing in the existing asset portfolio and through the acquisition of new commercial opportunities as they arise, rather than to provide shareholder return through dividends.
This is, however, reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
The Group seeks to optimise the return on investment, by managing the capital structure to achieve capital efficiency via the appropriate level of access to the debt markets at attractive cost levels.
Notes 21 and 22 to the financial statements provide further details of the Groups financing activity.
Capital for the Group is equity attributable to the equity holders of the Parent company, and is detailed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity on page 61.
Share-based payments During the year the following share-based payment arrangements were in operation by the Company: The 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The extent, nature, term and general terms and conditions, including vesting, relating to this arrangement, are detailed in the Report on Directors Remuneration on pages 49 to 51.
Share-based payments The fair valuation of the LTIP awards was undertaken by Halliwell Consulting, the Companys Remuneration consultants, using a Monte Carlo model, and utilised the following key inputs: continued 2006 & 2007 Awards 2008 Awards Risk free interest rate 4.7255% to 5.5184% 3.8340% Expected volatility 33.8827% to 42.5506% 34.8783% Exercise price 0.00 0.00 Dividend yield 0.00% 0.00% Vesting period 3 years 3 years Expected life 3 years 3 years Forfeiture rate per annum 8.00% 0.00% level 1 & 2 8.00% level 3 The expected life is the period from the date of grant to the vesting date.
The weighted average fair value of the awards granted in 2008 was 5.3840.
The LTIP is an equity settled share based payment arrangement.
The Company recognised a total expense during the year of 1,821,000 2007: 770,000 in respect of the LTIP.
The Share Option Scheme The extent, nature, term and general terms and conditions, including vesting, relating to this arrangement, are detailed in the Report on Directors Remuneration on page 55.
The Share Save Scheme The extent, nature, term and general terms and conditions, including vesting, relating to this arrangement, are also detailed in the Report on Directors Remuneration on page 53.
The Share Option and Share Save Scheme are considered to be equity-settled transactions, and for all awards post 7 November 2002, require to be fair valued at the date of award.
The fair value process and the underlying assumptions used are described below.
Based on the results of this actuarial review, the Share Save Scheme was demonstrated to be immaterial and accordingly the requirements of IFRS 2 Share Based Payment, are not applied to this arrangement.

Share-based payments The Phantom Option Scheme continued Senior managers excluding Directors, participate in this arrangement, which mirrors the terms and conditionality of the Share Option Scheme, except that on exercise they are cashsettled transactions.
As such, these transactions also require to be fair valued, but at each reporting date.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of movements in the respective option schemes.

These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
2 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 18.271 2007: Nil.
For the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2008, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 3.71 years 2007: 4.71 years.

Share-based payments The Phantom Option Scheme continued continued For the two awards of share options post 7 November 2002 January 2003 and December 2004, the Company was assisted in the process of establishing the fair value at the date of the grant of the awards by CPRM, a professional actuarial firm, and part of the Cavanagh Group.
CPRM estimated the fair value using a binomial model, utilising a risk free discount rate and taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted, and the performance conditions that were required to be satisfied before vesting.
The risk free discount rate is a measure of the guaranteed returns that could be earned in the market over a given term at the valuation date.
In line with IFRS 2 requirements, this has been set as the yield on a zero coupon government bond with a remaining term equal to the expected term on the option being valued, allowing for expected early redemption of the option.
CPRM were also provided with the detailed rules of each scheme and all the objective data relating to historic awards grants, exercises, lapses, withdrawals etc as well as the Companys historic daily share price and staff turnover analysis.
In addition, the following assumptions were also made with respect to the expected volatility of the Companys share price and the expected life of an option.
For volatility, the Company used share price data from 2002 onwards.
This was the year the Company acquired 4 new producing development assets in the North Sea, which were transforming to the Company, and which significantly reduced the influence of the historic Russian activity on the Company.
This geographical shift has lead to a lower volatility in the Companys share price which is expected to continue into the future.
CPRM were able to corroborate this fact by establishing that the standard deviation of the Companys share price the measure of volatility from the FTSE All Share Index throughout the historic period, reduced considerably from 2002 onwards.
Accordingly, an annual volatility assumption of 34% was utilised.
The life of the option depends on the trigger levels at which employees decide to exercise before the option expires and the extent to which option holders withdraw from the schemes due to staff turnover or mortality.
Due to the small number of members included in the Dana schemes, the results of any historic analysis are very sensitive to personal circumstances at the time of exercise and therefore the results are not representative nor an appropriate profile to extrapolate into the future.
Accordingly, on CPRMs recommendation, the following profile was used which is consistent with their wider actuarial experience of actual member exercise rates but still aligned with the specific history for the Dana Scheme.
Profit Trigger 25% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% No Trigger % Exercising 15 25 25 15 10 5 5 The staff turnover assumption is based on the Companys historic rate of staff turnover amongst all share option holders.
This was established from factual historic data at 8% pa. Mortality prior to expiry was assumed to be nil.
The fair value of the Phantom cash-settled options was established in exactly the same way, and until the liability is ultimately settled, it is required to be remeasured at each reporting date, with changes to fair value recognised in the income statement.
