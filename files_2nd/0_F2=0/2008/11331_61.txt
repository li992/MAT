Sterling US Dollar Cross currency derivatives As explained in Note 24, the Group has Sterling US Dollar cross currency derivatives to manage its exposure to foreign exchange movements between US Dollars, the denomination of loan note liabilities, and Sterling, the functional currency of the Group.
The movement in fair value of these derivatives is a function of both the Sterling US Dollar exchange rate and market interest rates prevailing in the United Kingdom and United States.
As a result of the key terms of the cross currency derivatives and the loan notes, against which a hedging relationship is designated, being identical, any gains or losses on foreign exchange included in the fair value of the Sterling US Dollar cross currency swaps are transferred to the income statement and are exactly offset in the income statement by an equal and opposite amount on retranslation of the US dollar loan notes to the closing rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, leaving a net impact of nil on the income statement for all Sterling US Dollar exchange rates.
The net impact on the hedging reserve, arising from these particular derivatives, therefore represents only the gain or loss on the interest rate element of the fair value of the derivatives, as explained further in Note 24.
Consequently, any fluctuation in the rate of the US dollar has no impact on either profit and loss or equity.

The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing use of interest rate swap and collar contracts.
Hedging activities are reviewed regularly to align with interest rate views and facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting liabilities.
Included in Note 23 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management Liquidity and interest risk tables section of this note.
