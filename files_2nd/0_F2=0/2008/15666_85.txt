FIVE YEARS IN REVIEW The following table summarizes selected financial data prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP for the five most recent years.
Please see the Results of Operations section of our Managements Discussion and Analysis included in this annual report for commentary on our results, significant trends and items affecting comparability over the three-year period ended December 31, 2008.
Our 2008 results prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP are not directly comparable to 2007 due to the Reuters acquisition and certain special items.
Therefore, we have also provided pro forma information in our Managements Discussion and Analysis to further explain and compare our 2008 and 2007 operating performance.
