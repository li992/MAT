notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Group and Company General information Shanks Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as required by Article 4 of the European Union IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, which are stated at fair value.
The policies set out below have been consistently applied.
The Group has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 April 2007.
During the year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements which are required to be implemented from 1 April 2007.
Other than increased disclosure concerning financial instruments and management of capital, IFRS 7 has not had an impact on reported profits or net assets.
During the year, the Group has early adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments in order to facilitate a greater understanding and improve the transparency of the Groups reported results.
Accordingly, the Group has restated its segmental information in note 2.
There has been no impact on reported profits or net assets.
In July 2007 IFRIC 14 The Limit on Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction was issued.
It limits the recognition of a defined benefit asset when minimum funding requirements exist within a retirement benefit plan.
IFRIC 14 was implemented by the Group from 1 April 2007 and this has had no impact on reported profits or net assets.
Other accounting standards and interpretations in issue at the date of approval of these financial statements but not yet effective are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The most significant judgements made relate to assumptions concerning discount rates, future returns on assets and future contribution rates in connection with the Groups retirement benefit schemes see note 22.
In making these assumptions, the Group takes advice from qualified actuaries.
Other significant judgements made relate to provisions and PFI contracts see below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Shanks Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries.
Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties joint ventures are incorporated in the financial statements by proportional consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements up to, or from, the date control passes.
Wholly owned subsidiary companies set up under PFI contracts are fully consolidated by the Group.
PFI contracts The Groups PFI contracts are all Integrated Waste Management contracts.
In these contracts, the existing Local Authority waste management services are operated by the Group from inception of the contract.
The PFI contract requires the building of new infrastructure to add to that inherited from the previous service provider and all rights to the infrastructure pass to the Local Authority at the termination or expiry of the contract.
The payments made to contractors for the construction of the infrastructure are accounted for as financial assets.
The Group accounts for the service element as revenue and the repayment element is deducted from the financial asset.
Interest receivable is added to the financial asset based on the rate implied in the contract payments.
Reviews are undertaken regularly to ensure that the financial asset will be recovered over the contract life.
Borrowing costs relating to contract specific external borrowings are expensed in the income statement.
annual report 2008 49 notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Bid costs are expensed in the income statement until the Group is appointed preferred bidder and there is a high probability that a contract will be awarded.
Bid costs incurred after this point are capitalised within trade and other receivables.
When the contract is awarded, the costs are included in the relevant financial asset.
Revenue Revenue represents the invoiced value of waste streams processed and other services provided including landfill tax but excluding sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised when processing occurs or when the service is provided.
Exceptional items Items are classified as exceptional and disclosed separately due to their size or incidence to enable a better understanding of performance.
These include but are not limited to the change in fair value of financial instruments and the profit or loss on disposals of properties.
Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based Payments has been applied to grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 which had not vested as of 1 April 2005.
The fair value of options granted is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Adjustments to the amounts expensed are only made in respect of nonmarket related factors.
Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arises when the cost of acquiring subsidiaries and businesses exceeds the fair value attributed to the net assets acquired.
Capitalised goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS 31 March 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP net book value following impairment tests.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated.
The profit or loss on disposal or closure of a business is calculated after taking into account any goodwill excluding amounts previously written off to reserves prior to 1998. ii Landfill void When landfill operations are acquired, landfill void is capitalised based on the fair value of the void acquired and is amortised over its estimated useful life on a void usage basis.
iii Other intangibles Other intangible assets are capitalised on the basis of the fair value of the assets acquired or on the basis of costs incurred to purchase and bring the assets into use.
These are amortised over the estimated useful life on a straight line basis as follows: Computer software 1 to 5 years Waste permits 5 to 20 years Other 5 to 10 years 50 shanks.
annual report 2008 1 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment except for freehold land is stated at cost less depreciation and provision for any impairment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
i Buildings, plant and machinery Depreciation is provided on these assets to write off their cost by equal annual instalments over the expected useful economic lives.
The expected useful life of buildings is 25 to 50 years.
Plant and machinery lives are: Computer equipment 1 to 5 years Mobile plant 5 years Generation equipment 8 to 15 years Heavy goods vehicles 5 to 10 years Other items 3 to 20 years ii Landfill sites Site development costs including engineering works and the discounted cost of final site restoration are capitalised.
These costs are written off over the operational life of each site based on the amount of void space consumed.
Impairment of assets Assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value.
If the recoverable amount is estimated to be less than the carrying amount the asset is reduced to the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately as an operating expense.
Leased assets i Finance leases Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
Leased assets are included in property, plant and equipment at the total of the capital elements of the payments during the lease term and the corresponding obligation is included in payables.
Depreciation is provided to write off the assets over the expected useful life.
ii Operating leases All leases other than finance leases are treated as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate.
The obligation to pay future rentals on operating leases is shown in note 27 to the accounts.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are measured on a first in first out basis.
Government grants and subsidies Capital related government grants are released to the income statement evenly over the expected useful lives of the assets to which they relate.
Revenue grants and subsidies are credited in the same period as the items to which they relate.
Unprocessed waste The accrual or deferred income relating to unprocessed waste is calculated at the higher of sales value or processing cost.
Site restoration provision Full provision is made for the net present value NPV of the Groups unavoidable costs in relation to restoration liabilities at its landfill sites and this value is capitalised and amortised over the useful life of the site.
In addition the Group continues to provide for the NPV of intermediate restoration costs over the life of its landfill sites and mineral extraction sites, based on the quantity of waste deposited or mineral extracted in the year.
annual report 2008 51 notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Aftercare provision Provision is made for the NPV of post closure costs at the Groups landfill sites based on the quantity of waste deposited in the year.
Similar costs incurred during the operating life of the sites are written off directly to the income statement and not charged to the provision.
Discounting All long term provisions for restoration, aftercare and onerous leases are calculated based on the NPV of estimated future costs.
The effects of inflation and unwinding of the discount element on existing provisions are reflected within the financial statements as a finance charge.
The real discount factor currently applied is 2%.
Retirement benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under the amended IAS19 Employee Benefits.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at market value.
The operating and financing costs of the plans are recognised separately in the income statement and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Surpluses on defined benefit plans are recognised only to the extent that they are recoverable.
Movements in irrecoverable surpluses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they become due.
The Group participates in several multi-employer schemes in the Netherlands.
These are accounted for as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to split the assets and liabilities of the schemes between participating companies, and the Group has been informed by the schemes that it has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit.
Tax i Current tax Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or that are never taxable or deductible.
The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in full where the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the financial statements is different to the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited through the statement of recognised income and expense or directly to reserves, when it is charged or credited there.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the year end exchange rate.
Transactions and the results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures in foreign currencies are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Groups exchange reserve.
Cumulative exchange differences are recognised in the income statement in the year in which an overseas subsidiary undertaking is disposed of.
The Group applies the hedge accounting principles of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relating to net investment hedging to offset the exchange differences arising on foreign currency denominated borrowings with the translation of foreign operations.
Net investment hedges are accounted for by recognising exchange rate movements in the exchange reserve, with any hedge ineffectiveness being charged to the income statement in the period the ineffectiveness arises.
annual report 2008 1 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments i Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their nominal value reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
ii Financial assets relating to PFI contracts Financial assets relating to PFI contracts are classified as loans and receivables and are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration paid and subsequently amortised using the effective interest rate method.
iii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
iv External borrowings Interest bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the borrowings to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
v Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
vi Derivative financial instruments As part of the Groups PFI contracts, the Group has a number of interest rate swaps.
These swaps are measured at fair value at each reporting date with the gains or losses between period ends being taken to finance charges in the income statement.
vii Other receivables and other payables Other receivables and other payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Dividends Dividends are accounted for on a cash basis and are not accrued in the balance sheet.
Segmental reporting The Groups organisational structure reflects the national nature of markets in which it operates, with divisions in the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Canada.
annual report 2008 53 notes to the financial statements continued 2 Segmental reporting The Group operates in the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Canada.
As discussed in the Business Overview on pages 7 to 11 the waste markets are different in each member state of the European Union.
As a result, the Group is organised and managed mainly by geographical location.
Each geographical location can be analysed according to the following types of activity: Solid Waste Non-hazardous solid waste collections, transfer and recycling Landfill and Power Landfill disposal including contaminated soils and power generation from landfill gas Hazardous Waste Industrial cleaning, hazardous waste transport, treatment including contaminated soils and disposal and contaminated land remediation Organic Treatment Anaerobic digestion and tunnel composting of source segregated organic waste streams PFI Contracts Long term United Kingdom municipal waste treatment contracts Sand Quarry Mineral extraction The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in note 1, except that pension expense for the United Kingdom is recognised and measured on the basis of cash payments to the pension plan.
The profit measure the Group uses to evaluate performance is trading profit.
Trading profit is operating profit before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles excluding landfill void and computer software and exceptional items.
The Group accounts for inter-segment trading on an arms length basis.
The information for the 2007 comparatives has been restated in the new format.

As a result of changes announced in the 2007 Budget, UK corporation tax will reduce from 30% to 28% effective from April 2008 and the deferred tax impact of this has been included above.
There will also be a phased withdrawal of industrial buildings allowances over a period of 4 years and a reduction in general pool writing down allowances from 25% to 20% which will be enacted in the Finance Act 2008.
It is estimated that this will result in a 25m exceptional tax charge in the year ending 31 March 2009.
This principally relates to the non discounted value of tax relief that would have been available on the PFI infrastructure towards the end of the 25 year PFI contracts.

Adjusting for amortisation of acquisition intangibles brings the Groups adjusted measure into line with general practice.
Exceptional items are those items that need to be disclosed separately on the face of the income statement because of their size or incidence.
Changes in fair values of interest rate swaps that the Group is required to enter into in relation to its PFI arrangements are considered to be exceptional items.
Goodwill impairment Impairment testing is carried out at segment level on an annual basis.
The Group estimates the recoverable amount of goodwill using projected cashflows for the next twenty years discounted at the Groups estimated average cost of capital 9% after tax.
The cash flows are based on projections prepared by management covering a five-year period, and include no growth assumptions after the end of the current five-year plan.
The projections also assume that the current five-year plan is achieved.
The calculations use effective tax rates specific to each separate segment.
Other intangible assets impairment Other intangible assets includes site or waste permits, customer lists and other acquired intangible assets as well as computer software.
During the year there has been no indication of any impairment.
Accordingly, no impairment review has been carried out.
Depreciation expense of 33.4m 2007: 29.1m has been charged in cost of sales, and 0.9m 2007: 0.9m in administrative expenses.

annual report 2008 67 notes to the financial statements continued 14 Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences under the liability method using applicable local tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 10.3m 2007: 11.8m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 7.6m 2007: 8.6m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No liability has been recognised on the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing and method of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that such differences will not give rise to a tax liability in the foreseeable future.

The fair value of interest swaps is measured by reference to the cost of foreclosing the swap position at the year end.
None of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps is attributable to changes in the Groups credit risk.
Risk management The Group is exposed to market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Group Treasury is charged with managing and controlling risk relating to the financing and liquidity of the Group under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Group Treasury does not enter into speculative transactions.
annual report 2008 69 notes to the financial statements continued 16 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk A substantial part of the Groups borrowings are at floating rates which exposes the Group to interest rate risk.
The Groups core borrowings are mainly at floating rates except for the senior notes which are at fixed rates.
The debt relating to PFI nonrecourse borrowings is at floating rates and the Group has entered into interest rate swaps as a condition of the related debt.
The interest rate swaps represent a hedge of the interest cash flows and although hedge accounting under IAS 39 would allow changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps to be recognised directly in reserves, the Group believes that it is not worth expending significant resources fulfilling the onerous documentation requirements of IAS 39.
The interest rate swaps are therefore classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39.
The swaps are presented in non-current liabilities together with the related long term borrowings since the Group believes this best reflects the commercial reality of the instruments.
Changes in interest rates could have a significant impact on banking covenants relating to interest cover and on the interest charge in the income statement.
The Group manages this risk by fixing the interest rates on a proportion of its total borrowings.
The proportion of borrowings fixed at any one time is dependent on forecast interest rate cover.
In order to measure the risk, borrowings and the expected interest cost for the year are forecast on a quarterly basis and scenarios run using managements expectations of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Interest expense volatility remained within acceptable limits throughout the year.
The Groups exposure to, and the way it manages interest rate risk has not changed from the previous year.
The weighted average effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2008 2007 Weighted Weighted average average Floating Fixed interest Floating Fixed interest rate rate rate rate rate rate Group m m % m m % Financial assets: Financial assets relating to PFI contracts 158.7 5.6 149.9 5.6 Cash and cash equivalents 34.3 17.6 Short term deposits 18.9 5.4 25.1 5.3 Financial liabilities: Bank overdrafts and short term loans 2.2 4.8 Senior notes 41.1 6.9 35.0 6.9 Bank loans 325.2 5.5 253.4 5.1 Interest rate swaps 123.8 123.8 5.3 126.6 126.6 5.3 Excluded from the analysis above is 10.1m 2007: 9.0m of amounts payable under finance leases as set out in note 19, which are subject to fixed rates of interest.
In addition, trade and other receivables and payables have been excluded as they are not interest bearing.
The average term for short-term deposits is no more than seven days.
For the Company, the effective interest rate on short term deposits was 5.4% 2007: 5.3% with an average term of 1 day 2007: 30 days.
The effective interest rate on the Companys cash and cash equivalents was 5.0% 2007: nil.
The weighted average effective interest rates relating to the Company were nil 2007: 4.8% for Euro bank overdrafts, 6.9% 2007: 6.9% for senior notes and 5.4% 2007: 4.7% for bank loans.

The majority of the Groups subsidiaries conduct their business in their respective functional currencies, therefore there is limited transaction risk.
Foreign exchange risk arises mainly from net investments in foreign operations.
This exposure is reduced by funding the investments as far as possible with borrowings in the same currency.
The Group applies hedge accounting principles to net investments in foreign operations and the related borrowings.
During the year, the Group acquired Orgaworld which has operations in Canada, exposing the Group to movements in the Canadian Dollar.
This foreign investment is hedged through borrowings in Canadian Dollars.
The Group has designated the carrying value of Euro borrowings of 113.5m 2007: 80.3m fair value of 113.6m 2007: 80.5m as a net investment hedge of the Groups investments denominated in Euros.
The hedge was 100% effective 2007: 100% for the year ended 31 March 2008 and as a result the related exchange loss of 17.1m 2007: 2.6m gain on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in the exchange reserve.
Foreign exchange rate sensitivity assuming all other variables remain constant : The following table details how the Groups income and equity would increase if there were a 10% increase in the respective currency against sterling.

As well as term borrowing under a syndicated loan facility, the Group maintains uncommitted lending facilities with a range of banks for working capital purposes.
The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast cash flows to ensure that facility draw-downs are arranged as necessary and an adequate level of headroom is maintained.
The Groups exposure to, and the way it manages liquidity risk has not changed from the previous year.

Each PFI company has loan facilities which are secured by fixed and floating charges on the future cash flows of PFI contracts.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.
Surplus cash, when not used to repay borrowings, is placed on deposit with banks and money market funds in accordance with a policy that specifies the minimum acceptable credit rating and the maximum exposure to each counterparty.
At 31 March 2008 the amount of credit risk totalled 53.2m 2007: 42.7m.
Credit risk on derivatives where the fair value is positive is closely monitored to ensure that it remains within the limits set for each counterparty.
At 31 March 2008 the credit risk was Nil 2007: 0.4m.
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly amounts due from customers for services performed.
Management consider that the exposure to any single customer is not significant and that where credit quality is in doubt, adequate provision has been made for probable losses.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The financial assets relating to PFI contracts are recoverable from the future revenues relating to the PFI contracts.
Management consider that as the counterparties for the future revenues are UK local authorities or councils, there is minimal credit risk.
Capital risk management The Group maintains a group funding strategy to ensure that the Group maintains an appropriate debt to equity ratio as well as an appropriate debt maturity profile.
The strategy is based on the requirements of the Companys Articles of Association, which state that debt should be limited to three times the level of capital and reserves.
The Groups funding strategy has not changed from the previous year.
annual report 2008 16 Financial instruments continued The Group has to comply with a number of banking covenants which are set out in the agreements for bank loans and senior notes.
There are financial covenants which are measured using the performance of the Core Group, excluding PFI companies, and relate to interest cover, the ratio of debt to EBITDA and the net worth of the Group.
There are other restrictions in the loan documentation concerning acquisitions, disposals, security and other issues.
The Group has complied with its banking covenants.

Assumptions The most recent actuarial valuation of the principal funded defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Group dated 5 April 2006 have been updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of these schemes at 31 March 2008.
The main assumptions were as follows: 2008 2007 % p. a.
Discount rate 6.9 5.4 Future salary growth 5.2 4.7 Rate of increase in pensions payment fixed 3% 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase in pensions payment cap 5% 3.6 3.2 Rate of increase in pensions payment cap 2.5% 2.4 2.4 Rate of price inflation 3.7 3.2 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 22 years if they are male and for a further 24 years if they are female.
The assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.

The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the schemes as at 31 March 2008.
At 31 March 2008 the IAS 19 net retirement benefit surplus was 9.4m 2007: deficit 8.4m.
The change is due to a 19m decrease in liabilities mainly as a result of the increase in discount rate used to calculate the liability at the year end in accordance with the accounting standard.
The year end discount rate of 6.9% 2007: 5.4% reflects corporate bond rates at the year end and has led to a significant movement in the IAS 19 calculation for accounting purposes at 31 March 2008.
The amount of the surplus varies if the main financial assumptions change, particularly the discount rate.
If the discount rate increased or decreased by 0.1% the IAS 19 asset would increase or decrease by circa 1.5m.

b Overseas In the Netherlands, employees are members of either a multi-employer pension scheme or other similar externally funded schemes.
These schemes are treated as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to separately identify the Groups share of the assets and liabilities of those schemes.
The Group has been informed by the schemes that it has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit.
In Belgium, the Group operates small defined contribution schemes.
The total cost in the year for overseas pensions was 5.7m 2007: 4.9m.
