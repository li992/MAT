Annual Report 2008 British American Tobacco 161 Directors report and accounts Notes on the accounts continued 27 Share-based payments continued Assumptions used in the Black-Scholes models to determine the fair value of share options at grant date were as follows: 2008 2007 Long-term Sharesave Long-term Sharesave incentive plan schemes incentive plan schemes Share price at date of grant 19.03 20.01 17.00 15.41 15.69 17.94 Exercise price nil-cost 13.60 nil-cost 14.35 Volatility % 18 23 21 20 18 Average expected term to exercise years 3.50 3.2 5.2 3.5 3.2 5.2 Risk-free rate % 3.9 4.5 2.72 3.15 5.1 5.5 4.4 4.5 Expected dividend yield % 3.7 3.5 4.1 4.1 4.0 3.5 Where 2 figures have been quoted for the Long-term incentive plan, the first number represents the March award and the second number the May award.
Where 2 figures have been quoted for the Sharesave Schemes, the first number represents the assumptions for the 3-year savings contract and the second number for the 5-year savings contract.
Market condition features were incorporated into the Monte-Carlo models for the total shareholder return elements of the Long-term incentive plan, in determining fair value at grant date.
Assumptions used in these models were as follows: 2008 2007 Average share price volatility FTSE 100 comparator group 26 28 Average share price volatility FMCG comparator group 19 21 Average correlation FTSE 100 comparator group 31 27 28 Average correlation FMCG comparator group 18 17 18 Where 2 figures have been quoted for the Long-term incentive plan, the first number represents the March award and the second number the May award.
The expected British American Tobacco p. l. c. share price volatility was determined taking account of the daily share price movements over a 5 year period.
The respective FMCG and FTSE 100 share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the same periods.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions, forfeiture and historical experience.
The risk-free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the yield from the last 2 declared dividends divided by the grant share price, adjusted for the Groups announced change in dividend policy.
For grants containing earnings per share performance conditions, the payout calculation is based on the expectations published in analysts forecasts.
