24. financial riSk manaGement The Company is an investment company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and conducts its affairs so as to qualify in the United Kingdom UK as an investment trust under the provisions of Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
In so qualifying, the Company is exempted in the UK from corporation tax on capital gains on its portfolio of investments.
The Companys investment objective is to achieve long-term capital growth through a diversified portfolio of Continental European securities.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to financial risks which could result in a reduction of either or both of the value of the net assets and the profits available for distribution by way of dividend.
These financial risks are principally related to the market currency movements, interest rate changes and security price movements, liquidity and credit.
The Board, together with the Manager, is responsible for the Companys risk management, as set out in detail in the Directors Report and Business Review.
The Directors policies and processes for managing the financial risks are set out in a, b and c below.
The accounting policies which govern the reported balance sheet carrying values of the underlying financial assets and liabilities, as well as the related income and expenditure, are set out in note 2 on the accounts.
The policies are in compliance with UK Accounting Standards and best practice and include the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
The Company does not make use of hedge accounting rules.
a Market risks The fair value of equity and other financial securities held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies and interest rates and by other financial issues, including the market perception of future risks.
The Board sets policies for managing these risks within the Companys objective and meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The Manager assesses exposure to market risks when making each investment decision and monitors ongoing market risk within the portfolio.
The Companys other assets and liabilities may be denominated in currencies other than sterling and may also be exposed to interest rate risks.
The Manager and the Board regularly monitor these risks.
The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies, thereby limiting the Companys exposure to future changes in foreign exchange rates.
Gearing may be short or long-term in foreign currencies, and enables the Company to take a long-term view of the countries and markets in which it is invested without having to be concerned about short-term volatility.
Income earned in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Board regularly monitors the effects on net revenue of interest earned on deposits and paid on gearing.
Currency exposure The principal currencies to which the Company was exposed during the year were the euro, Swiss franc, Norwegian krone and Swedish krona.
The exchange rates applying against sterling at 30 September and the average rates during the year ended 30 September were as follows: 2008 2007 Average for Average for At 30 September the year At 30 September the year Euro 1.2690 1.3171 1.4008 1.4783 1.9987 2.1380 Swiss franc 2.3800 2.4038 Norwegian krone 10.5384 10.5125 11.0471 11.9638 Swedish krona 12.4286 12.3858 13.1798 13.6211 46 Foreign & Colonial Eurotrust PLC 24. financial riSk manaGement continued Based on the financial assets and liabilities held and the exchange rates applying at the balance sheet date, a weakening or strengthening of sterling against each of these principal currencies by 10% would have the following approximate effect on returns attributable to equity shareholders and on net asset values NAV per share: 2008 2007 Swiss Norwegian Swedish Swiss Norwegian Swedish Weakening of sterling by 10% Euro franc krone krona Euro franc krone krona Net revenue return attributable to equity shareholders 000s 627 32 18 98 639 62 15 45 Net capital return attributable to equity shareholders 000s 19,819 2,908 2,756 2,491 32,357 5,807 3,595 3,694 Net total return attributable to equity shareholders 000s 20,446 2,940 2,774 2,589 32,996 5,869 3,610 3,739 NAV per share pence 41.91 6.03 5.69 5.31 63.74 11.34 6.97 7.22 2008 2007 Swiss Norwegian Swedish Swiss Norwegian Swedish Strengthening of sterling by 10% Euro franc krone krona Euro franc krone krona Net revenue return attributable to equity shareholders 000s 627 32 18 98 639 62 15 45 Net capital return attributable to equity shareholders 000s 19,819 2,908 2,756 2,491 32,357 5,807 3,595 3,694 Net total return attributable to equity shareholders 000s 20,446 2,940 2,774 2,589 32,996 5,869 3,610 3,739 NAV per share pence 41.91 6.03 5.69 5.31 63.74 11.34 6.97 7.22 These effects are representative of the Companys activities although the level of the Companys exposure to currencies fluctuates in accordance with the investment and risk management processes.

Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and borrowings, is at ruling market rates.
There were no material holdings in fixed interest investment securities during the year or at the year end 2007: same.
The Companys total returns and net assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates on cash and borrowings.
Based on the financial assets and liabilities held and the interest rates ruling at each balance sheet date, a decrease or increase in interest rates of 2% would have the following approximate effects on the income statement revenue and capital returns after tax and on the NAV per share: 2008 2007 Increase Increase Decrease Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000s 000s 000s 000s Revenue return 234 234 566 566 Capital return Total return 234 234 566 566 NAV per share pence 0.48 0.48 1.09 1.09 Other market risk exposures The Company does not usually enter into derivative transactions in managing its exposure to other market risks.
The portfolio of investments, valued at 286,025,000 at 30 September 2008 2007: 502,397,000 is therefore exposed to market price changes.
The Manager assesses these exposures at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews overall exposures at each meeting against indices and other relevant information.
An analysis of the portfolio by country and major industrial sector is set out in note 15 on the accounts.
Based on the portfolio of investments held at each balance sheet date, and assuming other factors remain constant, a decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio in sterling terms by 20% would have had the following approximate effects on the net capital return attributable to equity shareholders and on the NAV per share: 2008 2007 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in value in value in value in value 000s 000s 000s 000s Capital return 57,205 57,205 100,479 100,479 NAV per share pence 117.27 117.27 194.10 194.10 48 Foreign & Colonial Eurotrust PLC 24. financial riSk manaGement continued b Liquidity risk The Company is required to raise funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments and share buybacks.
These funds may be raised either through the realisation of assets or through increased borrowing.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given: the number of quoted investments held in the Companys portfolio 69 at 30 September 2008 : the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments: the industrial and geographical diversity of the portfolio see note 15 : and the existence of an ongoing loan facility agreement.
Cash balances are held with approved banks, usually on overnight deposit.
The Company does not normally invest in derivative products.
The Manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
The Company has a loan facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc of 30m renewable in September 2009.
The contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at each balance sheet date, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: 2008 2007 Three months Three months or less or less 000s 000s Current liabilities loans 11,820 31,411 Current liabilities other 2,813 10,286 14,633 41,697 c Credit risk and counterparty exposure The Company is exposed to potential failure by counterparties to deliver securities for which the Company has paid, or to pay for securities which the Company has delivered.
The Board approves all counterparties used in such transactions, which must be settled on the basis of delivery against payment except where local market conditions do not permit.
A list of pre-approved counterparties is maintained and regularly reviewed by the Manager and the Board.
Broker and stock lending counterparties are selected based on a combination of criteria, including credit rating, balance sheet strength and membership of a relevant regulatory body.
The rate of default in the past has been negligible.
Collateral on securities loaned to third parties exceeded the value of the securities throughout the duration of the loans.
Cash and deposits are held with approved banks.
The Company has an ongoing contract with its custodian for the provision of custody services.
The contract is reviewed regularly.
Details of securities held in custody on behalf of the Company are received and reconciled monthly.
To the extent that the Manager carries out management and administrative duties or causes similar duties to be carried out by third parties on the Companys behalf, the Company is exposed to counterparty risk.
The Board assesses this risk through regular meetings with the management of the Manager including the fund manager and with the Managers internal audit function.
In reaching its conclusions, the Board also reviews the Managers parent groups annual audit and assurance faculty report, group accounts and other public information indicative of its financial position and performance.
The Company had no credit-rated bonds or similar securities or derivatives in its portfolio at the year end 2007: none and does not normally invest in them.
None of the Companys financial liabilities are past their due date or impaired.
d Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The assets and liabilities of the Company are, in the opinion of the Directors, reflected in the balance sheet at fair value, or at a reasonable approximation thereof.
Borrowings under loan facilities are short-term in nature and hence do not have a value materially different from their capital repayment amount.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are converted into sterling at exchange rates ruling at each valuation date.
Report and Accounts 2008 49 Notes on the Accounts continued 24. financial riSk manaGement continued e Capital risk management The objective of the Company is stated as being to achieve long-term capital growth through a diversified portfolio of Continental European securities.
In pursuing this long-term objective, the Board has a responsibility for ensuring the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
It must therefore maintain an optimal capital structure through varying market conditions.
This involves the ability to: issue and buyback share capital within limits set by the shareholders in general meeting: borrow monies in the short and long term and pay dividends to shareholders out of current year revenue earnings as well as out of brought forward revenue reserves.
Changes to ordinary share capital are set out in note 16 on the accounts.
Dividend payments are set out in note 10 on the accounts.
Details of the loan are set out in note 13 on the accounts.
