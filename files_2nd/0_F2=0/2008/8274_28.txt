Central functions include costs of global functions, including technology, sales and marketing, finance, human resources and corporate services: revenue arises principally from technology fee income.
The Group further breaks each geographical region into three distinct business models which offer different growth, return, risk and reward opportunities: Franchised Where Group companies neither own nor manage the hotel, but license the use of a Group brand and provide access to reservations systems, loyalty schemes and know-how.
The Group derives revenues from a brand royalty or licensing fee, based on a percentage of room revenue.
Managed Where, in addition to licensing the use of a Group brand, a Group company manages the hotel for third-party owners.
The Group derives revenues from base and incentive management fees and provides the system infrastructure necessary for the hotel to operate.
Management contract fees are generally a percentage of hotel revenue and may have an additional incentive fee linked to profitability or cash flow.
The terms of these agreements vary, but are often long-term for example, 10 years or more.
The Groups responsibilities under the management agreement typically include hiring, training and supervising the managers and employees that operate the hotels under the relevant brand standards.
In order to gain access to central reservations systems, global and regional brand marketing and brand standards and procedures, owners are typically required to make a further contribution.
Owned and leased Where a Group company both owns or leases and operates the hotel and, in the case of ownership, takes all the benefits and risks associated with ownership.
Segmental results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

Goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for impairment testing as follows: 2008 2007 $m $m Americas managed operations 78 141 Asia Pacific managed and franchised operations 65 80 143 221 $141m before impairment charge.
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that an impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolate cash flows for the following four years using growth rates based on management expectations and industry growth forecasts.
After this period, the terminal value of future cash flows is calculated based on perpetual growth rates that do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
The cash flows are discounted using management estimates of the pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The key assumptions used for the value in use calculations are as follows: Year 2 to 5 growth rates Perpetual growth rates Discount rates 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % % % % % Americas managed operations 1.0-4.0 4.0 2.7 2.7 12.5 10.0 Asia Pacific managed and franchised operations 2.5-10.0 15.0 4.0 4.0 16.0 11.0 The impairment charge arises in respect of the Americas managed operations CGU reflecting revised fee expectations in light of the current economic climate.
At 31 December 2008, the recoverable amount of the Americas managed operations equalled its carrying value and consequently any adverse change in key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
In respect of the Asia Pacific managed and franchised operations CGU, management believe that the carrying value of the CGU would only exceed its recoverable amount in the event of highly unlikely changes in the key assumptions.

GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financial statements 79 20 Loans and other borrowings continued Unsecured bank loans Unsecured bank loans are borrowings under the Groups Syndicated Facility and its short-term bilateral loan facilities.
Amounts are classified as non-current when the facilities have more than 12 months to expiry.
These facilities contain financial covenants and, as at the balance sheet date, the Group was not in breach of these covenants, nor had any breaches or defaults occurred during the year.
In the second quarter of 2008, the Group successfully refinanced $2.1bn of long-term debt facilities.
This new syndicated bank facility consists of two tranches: a $1.6bn five-year revolving credit facility and a $0.5bn term loan with a 30-month maturity.

Hedging Interest rate risk The Group hedges its interest rate risk by taking out interest rate swaps to fix the interest flows on between 25% and 75% of its net borrowings in major currencies.
At 31 December 2008, the Group held interest rate swaps swapping floating for fixed with notional principals of USD250m, GBP75m and EUR75m 2007 USD100m, GBP150m and EUR75m.
The Group also held forward-starting interest rate swaps with notional principals of USD100m, GBP75m and EUR75m 2007 GBP150m and EUR75m.
These swaps will replace current swaps with the same notional principals when they mature in 2009.
The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of borrowings under the Syndicated Facility and they are held on the balance sheet at fair value in other financial assets and other payables.

The defined benefit section of the plan closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements.
The assets of the plan are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Groups assets.
In addition, there are unfunded UK pension arrangements for certain members affected by the lifetime allowance.
The Group also maintains the following US-based defined benefit plans: the funded InterContinental Hotels Pension Plan, unfunded InterContinental Hotels non-qualified pension plans and post-employment benefits schemes.
These plans are now closed to new members.
The Group also operates a number of minor pension schemes outside the UK, the most significant of which is a defined contribution scheme in the US: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, these schemes.

In respect of the UK plans, the specific mortality rates used are in line with the PA92 medium cohort tables, with age rated down by one year, implying the following life expectancies at retirement.
In the US, life expectancy is determined by reference to the RP-2000 healthy tables.

GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financial statements 85 24 Retirement benefits continued Sensitivities The value of plan assets is sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values.
Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the income statement and the balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.
UK US Increase Increase Higher lower decrease Higher lower decrease pension cost in liabilities pension cost in liabilities $m $m $m $m Discount rate 0.25% decrease 0.6 21.7 4.8 0.25% increase 0.4 20.5 4.6 Inflation rate 0.25% increase 1.3 20.4 0.25% decrease 1.2 19.2 Mortality rate one year increase 0.6 7.9 6.1 In 2018, the healthcare cost trend rate reaches the assumed ultimate rate.
A one percentage point increase decrease in assumed healthcare costs trend rate would increase decrease the accumulated post-employment benefit obligations as of 31 December 2008 by approximately $1.7m 2007 $1.9m and would increase decrease the total of the service and interest cost components of net postemployment healthcare cost for the period then ended by approximately $0.1m 2007 $0.1m.

The most recent actuarial valuation of the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan was carried out as at 31 March 2006 and showed a deficit of 81m on a funding basis.
Under the recovery plan agreed with the trustees, the Group aims to eliminate this deficit by March 2014 through additional Company contributions and projected investment returns.
Of the agreed contributions of 40m, three payments of 10m have been made and the final commitment of 10m is being met through the funding of the enhanced pension transfer arrangements detailed below.
