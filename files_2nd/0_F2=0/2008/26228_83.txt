50 Risk management and control This section describes the Groups approach to risk management.
It covers the overall approach that applies to all risks, and includes a detailed review of risks within the Groups key businesses.
Risk management objectives The Groups primary objective in undertaking risk management activity is to manage risk exposures in line with risk appetite, minimising its exposure to unexpected financial loss and limiting the potential for deviation from anticipated outcomes.
In this respect, a framework of limits and qualitative statements, aligned with the Groups risk appetite, is in place for material exposures.
Risk management approach A significant part of the Groups business involves the acceptance and management of risk.
The Group is exposed to insurance, market, credit, liquidity and operational risks and operates a formal risk management framework to ensure that all significant risks are identified and managed.
The risk factors mentioned below should not be regarded as a complete and comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.
Insurance risk: the risk arising from higher claims being experienced than anticipated.
Market risk: the risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates, share prices and other relevant market prices.
Credit risk: the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the Group.
Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group, though solvent, does not have sufficient financial resources available to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.
Operational risk: the risk arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.
Contagion risk: the occurrence of a risk in one part of the Group may result in contagion elsewhere in the Group.
An explanation of the risk framework and the methods used to monitor and assess risk exposures can be found in pages 50 to 57.
Management of risks The Group seeks to manage its exposures to risk through control techniques which ensure that the residual risk exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the Board.
The key control techniques for the major categories of risk exposure are summarised in the following sections.
com Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 139 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 50 Risk management and control continued Insurance risk Insurance risk is implicit in the Groups insurance business and arises as a consequence of the type and volume of business written and the concentration of risk in particular policies or groups of policies subject to the same risks.
A detailed review of the Groups inherent residual risks associated with insurance products is included on pages 150 to 153.
Insurance risk is managed using the following techniques: Policies and delegated authorities for underwriting, pricing and reinsurance The Groups insurance risk policy sets out the overall framework for the management of insurance risk.
As part of the framework, a structure of delegated pricing and underwriting authorities is in place.
Pricing is based on assumptions, such as mortality and persistency, which have regard to past experience and to trends.
Insurance exposures are limited through reinsurance.
Overall, the Group seeks to be conservative in its acceptance of insurance risks by establishing strict underwriting criteria and limits.
The underwriting policy is clearly documented, setting out risks which are unacceptable and the terms applicable for non-standard risks.
Reinsurance is used to reduce potential loss to the Group from individual large risks and catastrophic events.
It may also be used to manage capital or to provide access to specialist underwriting expertise.
The Group makes extensive use of reinsurance for its UK individual protection business, placing a proportion of all risks meeting prescribed criteria.
The principal General Insurance reinsurances are excess of loss catastrophe treaties, under which the cost of claims from a weather event, in excess of an agreed retention level, is recovered from insurers.
Reserving policy All subsidiaries writing insurance business have a documented reserving policy setting out the basis on which liabilities are to be determined using statistical analysis and actuarial experience.
Policies for each subsidiary are in line with locally established actuarial techniques, relevant regulation and legislation.
Further details of the assumption setting process are included in Note 37.
Market risk The Group exposure to market risk is influenced by one or more external factors, including changes in specified interest rates, financial instrument prices, foreign exchange rates and indices of prices or rates.
Significant areas where the Group is exposed to these risks are: assets backing insurance and investment contracts other than unit linked contracts: assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies: and other financial assets and liabilities The Groups market risk policy sets out the overall framework for the management of market risk.
The policy is reinforced by more granular investment policies for long term and other business, which have due regard to the nature of liabilities and guarantees and other embedded options given to policyholders.
The Group manages market risk using the following methods: Asset liability matching The Group manages its assets and liabilities in accordance with relevant regulatory requirements, reflecting the differing types of liabilities it has in each business.
For business such as immediate annuities, which is sensitive to interest rate risk, analysis of the liabilities is undertaken to create a portfolio of securities, the value of which changes in line with the value of liabilities when interest rates change.
This type of analysis helps protect profits from changing interest rates.
Interest rate risk cannot be completely eliminated, due to the nature of the liabilities and early redemption options contained in the assets.
For businesses where a range of asset types, including equity and property, are held to meet liabilities, the Group uses stochastic models to assess the impact of a range of future return scenarios on investment values and associated liabilities.
This allows the Group to devise an investment and with-profits policyholder bonus strategy which optimises returns to its policyholders over time, whilst limiting the capital requirements associated with these businesses.
The Group uses this method extensively in connection with its UK with-profits business.
140 Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 www.
com Group Financial Statements Derivatives The Group uses derivatives to reduce market risk.
The most widely used derivatives are exchange-traded equity futures and swaps.
The Group may use futures to facilitate efficient asset allocation.
In addition, derivatives are used to improve asset liability matching and to manage interest rate, foreign exchange and inflation risks.
It is the Groups policy that amounts at risk through derivative transactions are covered by cash or corresponding assets and that swaps are collateralised to reduce counterparty exposure.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is exposed to lower returns or loss as a direct or indirect result of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets and liabilities arising from changes in underlying interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on the investment portfolio it maintains to meet the obligations and commitments under its non-linked insurance and investment contracts, in that the proceeds from the assets may not be sufficient to meet the Groups obligations to policyholders.
To mitigate the risk that guarantees and commitments are not met, the Group purchases financial instruments, which broadly match the expected non-participating policy benefits payable, by their nature and term.
The composition of the investment portfolio is governed by the nature of the insurance or savings liabilities, the expected rate of return applicable on each class of asset and the capital available to meet the price fluctuations for each asset class, relative to the liabilities they support.
Additionally, fluctuations in interest rates will vary the repayments on variable rate debt issued by the Group Note 38.
Asset liability matching significantly reduces the Groups exposure to interest rate risk.
Sensitivity to interest rate changes is included in Table 6 of Note 50.
Inflation risk Inflation risk is the potential for loss as a result of relative or absolute changes in inflation rates.
The Group is exposed to inflation risk in two specific areas.
Certain non-linked contracts, such as annuities, may provide for future benefits to be paid taking account of changes in the level of inflation.
Contracts in payment may also include an annual adjustment for movements in prices indices, subject to an annual cap.
The Group seeks to manage the risk of movements in price indices through an appropriate investment strategy including the use of inflation swaps.
In writing long term business, the Group makes assumptions regarding the future costs of product servicing.
The assumptions take account of changes in price indices and the costs of employment, with stress testing evaluating the effect of significant deviations on the Groups capital position.
Currency risk The Group is potentially exposed to loss as a result of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, assets denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group manages its currency risk exposure in the following way: In respect of long term business assets and liabilities denominated in non-sterling currencies, the Group protects its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by backing obligations with investments in the same currency.
Balance sheet foreign exchange currency translation exposure in respect of the Groups international subsidiaries is actively managed in accordance with a policy, agreed by the Group Board, which allows net foreign currency assets to be hedged through the use of derivatives.
As described in Note 49, the Group is not directly exposed to risks on unit linked contracts.
Detailed risk disclosures have not been presented for unit linked assets and liabilities.

These changes may be as a result of features of the individual instrument, its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market.
The Group controls its exposure to geographic price risks by using internal country credit ratings.
These ratings are based on macroeconomic data and key qualitative indicators.
The latter take into account economic, social and political environments.
Table 3 indicates the Groups exposure to different equity markets around the world.
Unit linked equity investments are excluded from the table as the risk is retained by the policyholder.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk policy defines the overall framework for the management of credit risk.
Significant areas where the Group is exposed to credit risk are: The Group holds corporate bonds to back part of its insurance liabilities.
Significant exposures are managed by the application and regular review of concentration limits, with allowance being made in the actuarial valuation of the insurance liabilities for possible defaults.
The Group limits its exposure to insurance risk by ceding part of the risks it assumes to the reinsurance market.
To limit the risk of reinsurer default the Group operates a credit rating policy when arranging cover.
When selecting new reinsurance partners the Group considers only companies which have a minimum credit rating equivalent to A from Standard & Poors.
Exposure limits for new and existing reinsurers are determined based on credit ratings and projected exposure.
Aggregate counterparty exposures are regularly monitored both at an individual subsidiary level and on a Groupwide basis.
The credit profile of the Groups assets exposed to credit risk is shown in Table 4.
The credit rating bands are provided by independent rating agencies.
For unrated assets, the Group maintains internal ratings which are used to manage exposure to these counterparties.
Unit linked assets have not been included as shareholders are not directly exposed to risk.
The carrying amount of non-unit linked assets included in the balance sheet represents the maximum credit exposure.

Liquidity risk arises as a consequence of the uncertainty surrounding the value and timing of cash flows.
The Groups treasury function is responsible for managing the Groups banking relationships, capital raising activities, overall cash and liquidity position and the payment of dividends.
The Group seeks to manage funds and liquidity requirements on a pooled basis and to ensure the Group maintains sufficient liquid assets and standby facilities to meet a prudent estimate of its net cash outflows.
In addition, it ensures that, even under adverse conditions, the Group has access to the funds necessary to cover surrenders, withdrawals and maturing liabilities.
In practice, most of the Groups invested assets are marketable securities.
This, combined with the fact that a large proportion of the liabilities contain discretionary surrender values or surrender charges, reduces the liquidity risk.
The Group has in place a 960m syndicated borrowing facility, expiring in 2012, which provides flexibility in the management of the Groups liquidity.

The Group also uses embedded value EV financial information in addition to IFRS to manage and monitor performance, and to manage interdependences between different aspects of financial risks, for example for market risk.
This provides information about the value which is being created on the Groups long term insurance contracts.
EV information is calculated for the Groups life and pensions business covered business.
All other businesses are accounted for on the IFRS basis adopted in the primary financial statements.
The EV methodology requires assets of an insurance company, as reported in the primary financial statements, to be attributed between those supporting the covered business and the remainder.
The method accounts for assets in the covered business on an EV basis and the remainder of the Groups assets on the IFRS basis adopted in the primary financial statements.
Sensitivities have been presented for covered business only.
In this context the non-covered business is considered not to be material.
Whilst EV sensitivities do not directly reflect the short term movements under IFRS, they more closely reflect the long term economic out turn.
Cash flow projections are determined using realistic assumptions for each component of cash flow and for each policy group.
Future economic and investment return assumptions are based on conditions at the end of the financial year.
Future investment returns are projected by one of two methods.
The first method is based on an assumed investment return attributed to assets at their market value.
The second, which is used in the US, where the investments of that subsidiary are substantially all fixed interest, projects the cash flows from the current portfolio of assets and assumes an investment return on reinvestment of surplus cash flows.
The assumed discount and inflation rates are consistent with the investment return assumptions.
