Financial Performance FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15.
Intangible assets Intangible assets include the following items: i Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary, associate or business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is included in investment in associates.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to equity prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
ii Sales commissions Sales commissions are paid to distributors and to employees.
In many instances, upfront sales commission is paid to distributors and to employees when a fund product is first launched, and is based on the amount of investors monies introduced.
This upfront commission is an incremental cost that is directly attributable to securing investors in fund products from which the Group earns income based on an investment management contract with the relevant fund.
Accordingly, an intangible asset is recognised in accordance with IFRS, representing the Groups contractual right to benefit from future income from providing investment management services.
The carrying value of this intangible asset is based on the value of the initial upfront commission payments made to distributors and employees less an amortisation charge.
The amortisation period of upfront sales commissions is based on managements estimate of the weighted average period over which the Group expects to earn economic benefit from the investor being invested in each fund product.
Management estimates that this period is five years in both the current and the comparative year.
All unamortised upfront sales commission is subject to impairment testing each period to ensure that the future economic benefits arising from each fund product is in excess of the remaining unamortised commission.
Where it is not, the unamortised portion is written down as a charge to the income statement.
iii Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring in to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives three to five years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Direct costs include software development and associated employee costs.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives not exceeding three years.
For all intangible assets: a The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
b Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the income statement.
Amortisation of sales commissions is included in the sales commissions line in the income statement and amortisation of other intangibles is included in other expenses.
Impairment losses, if any, relating to sales commissions are included in sales commissions in the income statement and impairment losses, if any, relating to other intangibles are included in other expenses.

Other intangible assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it occurs at the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows obtainable as a result of the assets continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market-based discount rate on a pre-tax basis.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
a Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units equivalent to each of the Groups acquisitions.
The carrying amounts are presented below: 2008 2007 $m $m Glenwood 76 76 RMF 621 621 Man Investments Australia 100 88 MTM Capital 16 813 785 The key assumptions used by management for value in use calculations for each acquisition include: Rates p. a Net management fee growth 5% Net performance fee growth 0% Discount rate 10% Discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect returns that the market would expect of an investment with an equivalent risk profile.
A range of growth rates is used to simulate expected best and worst case scenarios, taking into consideration past performance and expectations for market development.
The growth rates used in the discounted cash flow models are conservative in that they are lower than managements expectations and those included in the budgets for future years.
If the growth rates applied to net management fee income were reduced to zero, no net performance fee income was assumed, and the discount rate increased to 15%, there would still be no impairment to goodwill.
As a result of these calculations, no impairment was identified.
b Intangible assets with finite useful lives No indications of impairment were evidenced during the year.
