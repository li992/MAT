Intangible assets continued Cash flow growth rates The cash flow growth rates are derived from managements latest estimates of forecast sales taking into consideration past experience of operating margins achieved in the CGU.
Historically, such forecasts have been reasonably accurate.
Sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates, the perpetuity growth rates and expected future cash flows.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, a reasonably possible change in the discount rate or perpetuity growth rate could cause an impairment in either the US School Curriculum or Penguin UK CGUs.
The fair value of US School Curriculum is 8% or approximately 77m above its carrying value, but an increase of 0.5 percentage points in the discount rate or a reduction of 0.6 percentage points in the perpetuity growth rate would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value.
The fair value of Penguin UK is 24% or approximately 44m above its carrying value, but an increase of 1.4 percentage points in the discount rate or a reduction of 1.7 percentage points in the perpetuity growth rate would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value.
