47 JPMorgan European Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2008 1.
Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the AIC in December 2005.
The accounting policies applied to these accounts are consistent with those applied in the accounts for the year ended 31st March 2007.
The Company has adopted FRS 29: Financial Instruments: Disclosures for the first time in these accounts.
FRS 29 introduces new disclosure requirements relating to financial instruments.
This standard does not have any impact on the classification and or valuation of the Companys financial instruments.
The disclosures required by this standard are given in notes 24 to 25 on pages 61 to 67.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from the total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the documented investment strategy and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition, the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to the acquisition which are written off to the capital column of the income statement at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which is bid market prices for listed investments.
Where trading in securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
Unlisted and restricted investments are valued at fair value by the Board.
In making its valuations, the Board takes into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains or losses on disposal are included in the capital column of the income statement within Gains or losses from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Transaction costs incurred on the purchase and sale of investments are also included within this caption.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable are included in the revenue column of the income statement on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is taken to capital.
Overseas dividends are included gross of withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is included in the revenue column.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is included in the capital column.
Stock lending income and interest receivable are included in the revenue column on an accruals basis.
Premiums receivable from written options are included in revenue on a time apportionment basis over the life of the instrument.
T H E C O M P A N Y JPMorgan European Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 48 1.
Accounting Policies continued d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses charged to the Company common to both pools are allocated to the pools in the same proportion as their net assets at the month end immediately preceding the date on which the cost is to be accounted for.
Expenses charged to the Company in relation to a specific pool are charged directly to that pool, with the other pool remaining unaffected.
Losses of one pool are not borne by the other.
Shareholders converting some or all of their shares into shares of the other class will bear the costs of the conversion up to a maximum of 2% of the value of the shares being converted.
Any costs in excess of this cap will be borne by all the shareholders of the Company.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the income statement with the following exceptions: performance fees payable to the manager are allocated 100% to capital in both pools.
the management fees of the Income pool of assets are allocated 40% to the revenue column and 60% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected split of revenue and capital return from the Income investment portfolio.
the management fees of the Growth pool of assets are allocated 30% to the revenue column and 70% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected split of revenue and capital return from the Growth investment portfolio.
expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are charged to the capital column.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise mainly brokerage commission.
In accordance with the SORP, disclosure of transaction costs is required and can be found in note 10. e Finance costs Finance costs, including any premium payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs on the Income pool of assets are allocated 40% to the revenue column and 60% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected split of revenue and capital return from the Income investment portfolio.
Finance costs on the Growth pool of assets are allocated 30% to the revenue column and 70% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected split of revenue and capital return from the Growth investment portfolio.
f Financial instruments Cash at bank and in hand may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables and payables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flow risk arising from interest rate fluctuations.
Gains or losses arising on the fair value of cash flow hedges during the year are shown in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds and are accounted for in Other reserve, which was created specifically for that purpose.
In accordance with FRS 26: Financial Instruments: Measurement, derivative instruments are valued at fair value and are included in current assets or current liabilities in the balance sheet.
T H E C O M P A N Y 49 JPMorgan European Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued g Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax is computed for each portfolio separately.
A pool which generates taxable revenues in excess of tax deductible expenses may benefit from the excess of tax deductible expenses in the other pool.
In this instance compensation amounting to half the tax savings in the taxable pool will be transferred to the non taxable pool.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to capital on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to capital.
h Foreign currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the revenue column of the income statement or the capital column, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
i Dividends payable In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, final dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are approved by shareholders.
j VAT Irrecoverable VAT is expensed to capital or income in the proportions in which it has been suffered.
The basis on which it has been calculated is the partial exemption method using the proportion of taxable supplies to non taxable supplies.
Further information regarding VAT on management fees is given in note 21 on page 59.

2008 2007 000 000 Net revenue return on ordinary activities before taxation 13,319 13,139 2008 2007 000 000 Net revenue return on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax of 30% 2007: 30% 3,996 3,942 Non taxable UK dividends 263 202 Income taxed in different periods 43 89 Tax relief on expenses charged to capital 1,030 3,003 Non taxable scrip dividends 5 Movement in excess expenses 1,030 1,000 Relief for overseas tax 1,675 1,826 Overseas withholding tax 1,620 1,621 3,630 1,621 The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 5,031,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 28% 2007: 6,475,000 based on a corporation tax rate of 30%.
This has arisen from deductible expenses exceeding taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolios, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, has issued guidance TECH 01 08, stating that profits arising out of a change in fair value of assets, recognised in accordance with accounting standards, may be distributed, provided the relevant assets can be readily converted into cash.
Securities listed on a recognised stock exchange are generally regarded as being readily convertible into cash and hence unrealised profits less losses amounting to 62,267,000 currently included within the Capital reserve - unrealised, may be regarded as distributable under company law.
Net asset values Net asset value per Growth share is calculated by dividing Growth shareholders funds of 330,961,000 2007: 374,770,000 by the 138,578,428 Growth shares in issue at the year end, excluding shares held in Treasury 2007: 150,606,035 ordinary shares, as adjusted for the five for one subdivision on 2nd August 2006.

Contingent assets liabilities and capital commitments In 2004 the AIC lodged a joint appeal for the payment of investment trust management fees to be exempt from VAT.
In June 2007 the European Court of Justice found in favour of the appellants and in November 2007 HM Revenue and Customs 'HMRC' announced their withdrawal from the case.
This means that henceforth, VAT will no longer be charged on investment management fees and that the Company is entitled to seek reimbursement of VAT paid in the past.
The Manager ceased charging VAT on management fees with effect from 1st October 2007 and has filed protective claims for the period subsequent to 1st February 2001 and as a result an amount in excess of 3.9 million is potentially recoverable for this period.
Furthermore a decision in the Court of Appeal has opened the possibility for additional VAT recovery from HMRC for the period from 1st January 1990 to 4th December 1996.
There is unlikely to be a claim for the intervening period from 5th December 1996 to 31st January 2001.
In the absence of a definitive agreement with the manager or specific guidance from HMRC as to how the reclaims will be effected, there is not yet certainty as to the amount or timing of any recovery.
Accordingly no asset has been recognised in the accounts at 31st March 2008.
At the balance sheet date there were no contingent liabilities or capital commitments 2007: none.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page for each share class.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Company's net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors' policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Company's risk management strategy.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
A summary of the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities by category is given in note 23.
The Companys financial instruments comprise the following: investments in Continental European equity shares, collective investment funds with Continental European exposure and liquidity funds which are all held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: a short term forward currency contract for the purpose of managing exposure to fluctuations in the value of short term liabilities: a bank loan and an issue of floating rate notes, both denominated in Euros, the main purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations: and interest rate swaps, the purpose of which is to hedge the variability in cash flows arising from interest rate fluctuations on the bank loan and floating rate notes.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements - currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market price risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with a sensitivity analysis where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Company's assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Company's functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Company's exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Company's net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowing may be used to limit the Company's exposure to anticipated changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
This borrowing is limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.

Financial instruments' exposure to risk and risk management policies continued Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31st March are shown below.
2008 2007 Euro Other Total Euro Other Total m m m m m m Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are monetary items 30.4 30.4 72.7 72.7 Net current assets liabilities 17.3 17.3 3.2 3.2 Bank loans 107.0 107.0 90.9 90.9 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 59.3 59.3 21.4 21.4 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 415.4 15.8 431.2 431.8 16.0 447.8 Total net foreign currency exposure 356.1 15.8 371.9 410.4 16.0 426.4 In the opinion of the Directors, the above year end amounts are broadly representative of the exposure to foreign currency risk during the year.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Company's monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary net foreign currency exposure at each balance sheet date and assumes a 5% appreciation or depreciation of sterling against the Euro and the other currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is deemed reasonable based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened this would have had the following effect:- 2008 2007 m m Income statement revenue after taxation: Revenue return 0.7 0.8 Capital return 3.0 1.1 Total revenue after taxation for the year 2.3 0.3 Net assets 2.3 0.3 Conversely if sterling had strengthened this would have had the following effect:- 2008 2007 m m Income statement revenue after taxation: Revenue return 0.7 0.8 Capital return 3.0 1.1 Total revenue after taxation for the year 2.3 0.3 Net assets 2.3 0.3 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is broadly representative of the whole year.

Financial instruments' exposure to risk and risk management policies continued ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits, the fair value of fixed interest rate securities and the interest payable on variable rate cash borrowings.
The Company has no investment in fixed interest rate securities.
Under the terms of a swap contract, 80% 2007: 100% of the interest payable on both the foreign currency bank loan and the foreign currency floating rate notes has been fixed.
Further detail of the loans and swap agreements are given below.
Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings are used when required.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
The Company has drawn down Euro 35 million on a loan agreement with Barclays Bank plc, repayable on 20th December 2009.
Interest payable on this loan is the Euro LIBOR rate as quoted in the market for the period of the advance plus a margin of 0.8%.
However, under the terms of a swap agreement with The Royal Bank of Scotland, the interest rate on 80% of the loan has been fixed at 5.74% per annum for the life of the loan.
At 31st March 2007 the whole loan was subject to the swap agreement but during the year the Company cancelled 20% of the swap contract.
The Company incurred breakage costs amounting to 60,000 for the partial cancellation of this contract.
The Company has issued a Euro 100 million floating rate note repayable on 6th June 2011.
The interest rate payable on this note is based on the offered rate for three month Euro deposits plus a margin of 0.53%.
However, under the terms of a swap contract with Lehman Brothers, the interest rate on 80% of the loan has been fixed at 5.31% per annum for the life of the loan.
The Company incurred breakage costs amounting to 296,000 for the partial cancellation of this contract.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to floating rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is as follows: 2008 2007 '000 '000 Amounts exposed to floating interest rates: Cash and short term deposits 30,661 564 Investments in Euro liquidity funds 30,376 72,709 Foreign currency bank loan 5,561 Foreign currency floating rate note 15,821 Total exposure 39,655 73,273 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin over LIBOR 2007: same.
The target interest earned on the liquidity funds is the 7 day Euro London Interbank Bid Rate.
The above year end exposures are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the cash balances and investments in liquidity funds have fluctuated and the loan interest swap agreements have been partially cancelled.
The maximum and minimum exposures during the year, arising from cash balances and liquidity funds, were as follows: 2008 2007 '000 '000 Maximum interest rate exposure to floating rates 83,774 108,895 Minimum interest rate exposure to floating rates 51,666 16,250 T H E C O M P A N Y 65 JPMorgan European Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Accounts continued 24.
Financial instruments' exposure to risk and risk management policies continued Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and equity to a 1.0% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Company's monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Company's total exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to floating rates at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
2008 2007 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate '000 '000 '000 '000 Income statement - return after taxation: Revenue return increase decrease 543 543 733 733 Capital return decrease increase income 146 146 Total increase decrease in return after taxation for the year 397 397 733 733 Net assets increase decrease 397 397 733 733 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is not representative of the whole year as the level of exposure changed frequently as investments in liquidity funds have fluctuated.
During the year, the highest amount invested in liquidity funds was 83.6m and the lowest was nil.
iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of equity investments and any other asset or liability held by the Company.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Company's investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Company's total exposure to other changes in market prices at 31st March comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2008 2007 '000 '000 Equity investments at fair value through profit or loss 460,456 478,795 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk A list of the Company's investments is given on pages 15 to 17 and 23 to 26.
This shows the majority of the investments value is in European equities but there is no concentration of exposure to any one European country.
It should also be noted that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.

Financial instruments' exposure to risk and risk management policies continued Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the revenue after tax and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% in the fair value of equity investments.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Company's equities and adjusting for change in the management fee, but with all other variables held constant.
2008 2007 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in fair value in fair value in fair value in fair value '000 '000 '000 '000 Income statement: revenue after taxation Revenue return - decrease increase 46 46 68 68 Capital return - increase decrease 45,731 45,731 47,733 47,733 Total revenue after taxation and net assets - increase decrease 45,685 45,685 47,665 47,665 b Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities as they fall due.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Company's assets comprise readily realisable securities, the liquidity of which in normal markets is frequently tested by the Manager and which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Board's policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows:- 2008 2007 In more than In more than In more than In more than Three one year but two years but Three one year but two years but months not more than not more than months not more than not more than or less two years five years Total or less two years five years Total '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 000 '000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Amounts due to brokers 28,409 28,409 55 55 Other creditors 1,559 1,559 3,739 3,739 Derivative financial instrument 3,042 3,042 4,841 4,841 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year Bank loans 27,904 79,106 107,010 23,754 67,179 90,933 Provisions for liabilities and charges Performance fee 3,752 3,752 33,010 27,904 79,106 140,020 8,635 27,506 67,179 103,320 T H E C O M P A N Y 67 JPMorgan European Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Accounts continued 24.
Financial instruments' exposure to risk and risk management policies continued c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a transaction fails to discharge its obligations under that transaction which could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk This risk is not significant and is managed by: only dealing with brokers which have been approved by JPMAM and banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies: and setting limits to the maximum exposure to any one counterparty at any time.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the balance sheet under investments in liquidity funds, debtors and cash and short term deposits represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year ends.
The liquidity funds have an AAA credit rating 2007: same.
Cash at bank comprises balances held at banks with an AA credit rating 2007: same.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either included in the balance sheet at fair value or the carrying cost in the balance sheet is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and to maximise the income and capital return to its Income and Growth share classes through an appropriate level of gearing.
The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 90% to 120%.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as investments, excluding liquidity fund holdings, expressed as a percentage of net assets.
2008 2007 Balance Balance 000 000 Investments excluding liquidity fund holdings 460,456 478,795 Net assets 400,211 450,192 Gearing 115.1% 106.4% The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back ordinary shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: and the need for issues of new shares, including reissues from Treasury.
