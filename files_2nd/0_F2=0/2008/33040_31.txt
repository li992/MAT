Intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
These are determined using cash ow projections derived from financial budgets approved by the board covering a five year period.
They reect managements expectation of revenue growth, operating costs and margin for each CGU based on past experience.
Cash ows beyond the five year period have been extrapolated using an estimated terminal growth rate of 0%.
This rate has been determined with regard to projected growth rates for the specic markets in which the CGUs participate and is not considered to exceed the long-term average growth rates for those markets.
Discount rates applied to the cash ow forecasts are derived from the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the different risk prole of the individual CGUs.
The discount rates applied were 10% and 11.4%.
The forecasts are most sensitive to changes in projected revenue growth rates in the first five years of the forecast period.
However there is significant headroom and based on the sensitivity analysis performed we have concluded that no reasonably possible changes in the base case assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.
