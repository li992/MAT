FINANCIALS NoteS to the CoNSoLIdAted FINANCIAL StAtemeNtS 52 NoteS to the CoNSoLIdAted FINANCIAL StAtemeNtS 1 ACCouNtINg poLICIeS basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified by fair values as applicable by IFRSs, and on the going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed on page 55.
The following new Standards and Interpretations to existing Standards have been published that are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 May 2007 and have been adopted in the preparation of these accounts: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 14 IAS 19 Limits on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction The adoption of these Standards and Interpretations has had no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of the adoption of IFRS 7 which, whilst it has no impact on the classification and valuation of the Groups financial instruments, has required the adoption of certain new disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, which are principally set out in Note 25.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not effective for the financial year ended 30 April 2008: IFRS 8 Operating segments IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IAS 23 Amendment Borrowing Costs The Group has not adopted these Standards and Interpretations early.
Their adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
restatement In order to enhance clarity for the readers of these financial statements a restatement in a disclosure item has been made which has no impact on gross profit, profit from operations or net assets.
New property deposits and on account contract receipts previously classified as a reduction in inventories are now disclosed within current trade and other payables following the principles applicable to deferred income.
Deposits received and on account contract receipts at 30 April 2008 amounted to 170,758,000 2007: 71,380,000. basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The accounting date for subsidiary undertakings is 30 April.
In the case of acquisitions or disposals, the Groups result includes that proportion from or to the effective date of acquisition or disposal as appropriate.
Subsidiary undertakings are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain the benefits from its activities.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiary undertakings are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Joint ventures Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The results attributable to the Companys holding in joint ventures are shown separately in the consolidated income statement.
The amount included in the consolidated balance sheet is the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures plus net loans receivable.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
The carrying value of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in joint ventures.
53 revenue Revenue represents the amounts receivable from the sale of properties during the year.
Properties are treated as sold and profits are taken when contracts are exchanged and the building work is physically complete.
This policy applies to both residential housebuilding and commercial property activities.
Revenue does not include the value of the onward sale of part exchange properties, for which the net gain or loss is recognised in cost of sales.
Segmental reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
expenditure Expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
borrowing costs Interest is written off to the income statement as incurred.
taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax, including UK Corporation tax, is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or received using the tax rules and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, or from the initial recognition except in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit, or from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which taxable temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred taxation is also dealt with in reserves.
Intangible assets a goodwill Where the cost of acquiring new and additional interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the resulting premium on acquisition goodwill is capitalised and its subsequent measurement is based on annual impairment reviews, with any impairment losses recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998 under UK GAAP was not reinstated on transition to IFRS and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
b other intangible assets Other intangible assets, which include customer contracts, have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at historic purchase cost less depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets on a straight line basis to their residual value over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates: Freehold property 2% Fixtures and fittings 15% 20% 1 Motor vehicles 25% Computer equipment 33 3% Leasehold property is amortised over the period of the lease.
Computer equipment is included within fixtures and fittings.
The assets residual values, carrying values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Where an impairment is identified, the recoverable amount of the asset is identified and an impairment loss, where appropriate, is recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
FINANCIALS FINANCIALS NoteS to the CoNSoLIdAted FINANCIAL StAtemeNtS 54 NOTES TO ThE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 ACCouNtINg poLICIeS CONTINUED Inventories Property in the course of development is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Direct cost comprises the cost of land, raw materials and development costs but excludes indirect overheads and interest.
Provision is made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of inventories and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Land purchased for development, including land in the course of development, is initially recorded at fair value.
Where such land is purchased on deferred settlement terms, and the fair value differs from the amount that will subsequently be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost in the income statement over the period to settlement.
trade and other receivables Trade receivables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
They do not carry any interest, and are reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances in hand and at the bank, including bank overdrafts repayable on demand which form part of the Groups cash management, for which offset arrangements across Group businesses have been applied where appropriate.
Share capital Ordinary shares and redeemable preference shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
trade and other payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs.
deposits New property deposits and on account contract receipts are held within current trade and other payables.
derivative financial instruments From time to time the Group makes use of interest rate swaps and caps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition these instruments are stated at fair value.
Where the derivative instrument is deemed an effective hedge over the interest rate exposure, the instrument is treated as a cash flow hedge, and hedge accounting is applied, whereby gains and losses in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognised directly in equity until such time as the gains or losses are realised.
On realisation, any gains are reported in the income statement net of related charges.
55 employee benefits a pensions The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Employee benefits.
The Group adopted early the amendment to IAS 19 issued by the IASB on 16 December 2004 which allows all actuarial gains and losses to be charged or credited to equity through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Since the Group has elected to follow this approach, all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes were recognised at the beginning of the first IFRS reporting period 1 May 2004.
For defined benefit schemes, the obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.
The calculation of the net obligation is performed by a qualified actuary.
The operating and financing costs of these plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of the employees and financing costs are recognised in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses were recognised at 1 May 2004, the beginning of the first IFRS reporting period, within the net obligation at that date.
Pension contributions under defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.
b Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments, in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 which had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The fair value of awards under the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plans at the date of grant are charged against profit on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards, based on the Groups estimate of the awards that will eventually vest.
Shares held in trust to satisfy these awards are treated as a deduction from shareholders funds.
Leasing and rental agreements Payments under rental and operating lease agreements are charged against profit on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management applies the Groups accounting policies as described above when making critical accounting judgements, of which no individual judgement is deemed to have a significant impact upon the financial statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are detailed below.
a Carrying value of land and work in progress and estimation of costs to complete The Group holds inventories stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Such inventories include land, work in progress and completed units.
As residential development is largely speculative by nature, not all inventories are covered by forward sales contracts.
Furthermore due to the nature of the Groups activity and, in particular the scale of its developments and the length of the development cycle, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between units being built and or completed in the current year and those for future years.
It also has to forecast the costs to complete on such developments.
In making such assessments and allocations, there is a degree of inherent estimation uncertainty.
The Group has established internal controls designed to effectively assess and centrally review inventory carrying values and ensure the appropriateness of the estimates made.
b pensions Pension assumptions are set out within Note 5 and are as advised by the Groups actuary.
The assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate used and the mortality rates.
Such estimations are based on assumed rates and, should these differ from what actually transpires, the pension liability of the Group would change.
c goodwill impairment Determining whether goodwill is impaired or not requires an estimation of value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit, the future growth rate of revenue and costs, and a suitable discount rate.
d deferred tax Assumptions are made as to the recoverability of deferred tax assets, especially as to whether there will be sufficient future profits to fully utilise these in future years.
For this reason segment reporting is only presented by business segment.
Included in Group residential housebuilding revenue and operating profit are 13,106,000 and 806,000 2007: 43,997,000 and 9,245,000 in respect of land sales.
Unallocated income, costs, assets and liabilities relate to those areas that are managed centrally by the Group, and cannot be reasonably allocated to the business segments.
These comprise the Groups net cash debt and associated interest receivable and payable, the current tax creditor, the deferred tax asset and the tax charge.

Remuneration paid to the auditors in respect of other services supplied pursuant to legislation of 35,000 relates to the interim review 2007: 25,000.
In addition to the above services, the Groups auditor acted as auditor to The Group plc Staff Benefit Plan and The Berkeley Group Money Purchase Pension Plan.
The appointment of auditors to the Groups pension schemes and the fees paid in respect of those audits are agreed by the trustees of each scheme, who act independently of the management of the Group.
The aggregate fees paid to the Groups auditors for audit services to the pension schemes during the year were 16,900 2007: 12,000.
Net operating expenses represent administration costs.

The Berkeley Group plc Group Personal Pension Plan the Berkeley Group Personal Pension Plan and the St George PLC Group Personal Pension Plan the St George Group Personal Pension Plan are defined contribution schemes.
The assets of these schemes were held in separate trustee administered funds.
In 2007, all members active and deferred were offered a transfer value from The Berkeley Group plc Staff Benefits Plan the Berkeley Final Salary Plan, a defined benefit scheme which had been closed to new entrants from 1 May 2002, to their own private pension arrangements and a potential enhanced transfer value from the Berkeley Final Salary Plan or a cash payment.
The offer was made to all employees and did not vary by grade.
The Berkeley Group Personal Pension Plan was established to receive transfers and future contributions.
The majority of active members accepted this offer and, as a result, the Berkeley Final Salary Plan was closed to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2007.
Included in Wages and salaries and Social security costs in 2007 in the table above are 2,586,000 and 340,000 in respect of payments to active members of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan who elected to receive the transfer value enhancement as a cash payment.
Payments to deferred members who elected to receive the enhanced transfer value as a cash payment were 3,413,000.
The payments resulted in a curtailment gain of 1,520,000 and a settlement gain of 4,305,000 in respect of the Groups defined benefit obligation.
In addition, 3,537,000 was paid to the Berkeley Final Salary Plan in respect of members requesting the transfer value enhancement as pension.
Fees and expenses of 1,100,000 in respect of this process were included within net operating expenses in 2007. defined contribution plan Contributions amounting to 2,204,325 2007: 1,743,000, of which nil 2007: 107,000 were paid on behalf of joint ventures, were paid into the defined contribution schemes during the year.
defined benefit plan The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is subject to an independent actuarial valuation at least every three years.
The most recent valuation was carried out as at 1 May 2007 and finalised in July 2008.
The method adopted in the 2007 valuation was the projected unit method, which assumed a return on investment prior to and after retirement of 6.5% and 5.0% per annum respectively and pension increases of 3.25% per annum.
The market value of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan assets at 1 May 2007 was 9,974,000 and was sufficient to cover 101% of the schemes liabilities.
With effect from 1 May 2007 and following the closure of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan to future accrual, employers contributions were paid at 45,000 per month.
Following the finalisation of the 2007 valuation, with effect from 1 July 2008, employers contributions were reduced to zero.
59 For the purposes of IAS 19, the 2004 valuation was updated for 30 April 2008.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 30 April 30 April Valuation at: 2008 2007 Rate of increase in salaries 4.2% Discount rate 6.6% 5.5% Inflation assumption 3.8% 3.2% Rate of increase in pensions in payment post-97 3.8% 3.5% Pre-97 receive 3% p. a. increases The mortality assumptions are the standard PMA92 base tables for males and PFA92 base tables for females, both adjusted for each individuals year of birth to allow for future improvements in mortality rates.
The life expectancy of male and female pensioners now aged 65 retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is 19.8 years and 22.8 years respectively 2007: 19.3 and 22.3.
The life expectancy of male and female deferred pensioners now aged 50 retiring at age 65 after the balance sheet date is 20.8 years and 23.8 years respectively 2007: 20.1 and 23.1.

The charge relates to key management personnel.
the berkeley group holdings plc 2004 b Long-term Incentive plan the 2004 b LtIp On 26 October 2004, under the terms of the 2004 b LTIP, the Company granted four Executive Directors the right to receive, at no cost, 21,321,361 ordinary shares in aggregate on 31 January 2011, if the Company has returned to shareholders 12 per share by that date.
The price of a Unit each Unit comprising one ordinary share of 5p, one 2006 B share of 5p, one 2008 B share of 5p and one 2010 B share of 5p in the Company at 26 October 2004 was 1,180p.
The fair value of the awards at the date of grant was 162p per Unit.
The fair value calculated was based on the share price at the date of grant, net of the discounted present value of expected returns to shareholders over the six-year vesting period.
The Company intends that, prior to 31 January 2011, substantially all returns to shareholders will be by way of payments made on the B shares 500p per Unit paid in December 2004, 200p per Unit paid in January 2007, 200p per Unit paid in January 2008 and 300p per Unit payable at a date to be determined by the Board but no later than January 2011.
None of the awards granted under this Scheme are expected to lapse by 31 January 2011.
There were no further grants under the 2004 b LTIP in the year, and no further grants are expected under this Scheme.

For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The dilutive potential Ordinary Shares relate to shares granted under employee share schemes where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Ordinary Shares during the year.
The effect of the dilutive Ordinary potential Shares is 71,072 shares 2007: 388,267, giving a diluted weighted average number of shares of 120,740,207 2007: 120,724,003.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out in the table below: 2008 2007 weighted Weighted average average number per-share number Per-share earnings of shares amount Earnings of shares amount 000 000 pence 000 000 pence Basic earnings per Ordinary Share 137,827 120,669 114.2 135,545 120,336 112.6 Effect of dilutive potential shares 71 388 Diluted earnings per Ordinary Share 137,827 120,740 114.1 135,545 120,724 112.3 Net assets per Ordinary Share is calculated based on net assets at the end of the year divided by the number of Ordinary Shares in issue at the end of the year of 120,740,207 2007: 120,426,806.
This excludes shares held by the Company to satisfy awards under its Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Return on capital employed ROCE is calculated based on profit before interest and tax including joint venture profit before tax divided by the average shareholders funds adjusted for net cash debt.

The acquisition was completed on 7 November 2006 and resulted in the recognition of goodwill of 17,159,000.
The goodwill balance is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount has been determined on the basis of the current five year pre tax divisional forecasts.
Key assumptions are as follows: i Cash flows beyond the initial five year period are not extrapolated ii A pre tax discount rate of 12.2% based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital The Directors have identified no reasonably possible change in a key assumption which would give rise to an impairment charge.
The goodwill balance has been allocated to residential housebuilding within the segmental analysis.
Other intangible assets relate to contracts for the sale of Units that had reserved or exchanged at the date of the acquisition of the 50% of the ordinary share capital of St James Group Limited that the Group did not already own.
This resulted in an intangible asset of 3,273,000 at the acquisition date.
This intangible asset is amortised as these reserved or exchanged Units are taken to profit.

Financial assets the Groups financial assets can be summarised as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 CurreNt trade receivables 17,629 22,206 Cash at bank and in hand 140,330 17,629 162,536 Cash at bank and in hand is at floating rates linked to interest rates related to liBoR.
the Group had no cash at bank and in hand at 30 april 2008 hence there is no effective interest rate at the balance sheet date 2007: 5.20%.
trade and other receivables are non-interest bearing.
together, these balances represent the Groups exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date.
trade receivables are spread across a wide number of customers, with no significant concentration of credit risk in one area.
there has been no impairment of trade receivables during the year, nor are there any provisions held against trade receivables, and none of the trade receivables are past their due date.
71 Financial liabilities the Groups financial liabilities can be summarised as follows: 2008 2007 Restated 000 000 CurreNt unsecured loan stock 85 85 Bank loans due within one year 59,283 Bank overdraft 4,464 trade payables 292,913 280,531 deposits and on account contract receipts 170,758 71,380 loans from joint ventures 96 420 accruals 42,297 39,290 510,613 450,989 NoN-CurreNt other non-current liabilities 48,202 62,819 48,202 62,819 all amounts included above are unsecured, with the exception of bank loans.
unsecured loan stock is repayable on three months notice being given to the Company, with floating interest rates linked to liBoR.
trade and other payables and other current liabilities are non-interest bearing.
Bank loans are secured with floating interest rates linked to liBoR.
the Group held no fixed rate liabilities at 30 april 2008 2007: nil.
further disclosures relating to security over the bank loans are set out in Committed borrowing facilities below.
the effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2008 2007 unsecured loan stock 5.00% 5.25% Bank overdraft 6.00% Bank loans 5.93% the above analysis excludes the effect of the change to finance costs imputed on land purchased on deferred settlement terms, since this represents an accounting transaction, with no interest being paid out of the Group.
maturity of non-current financial liabilities the maturity profile of the Groups non-current financial liabilities is as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 FINANCIAL LIAbILItIeS NoN-CurreNt in more than one year but not more than two years 19,101 28,580 in more than two years but not more than five years 22,014 34,239 in more than five years 7,087 48,202 62,819 Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities the carrying amounts of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities approximate to fair value.
the carrying amount of current trade and other receivables and of current trade and other payables approximate to their fair value as the transactions which give rise to these balances arise in the normal course of trade and, where relevant, with industry standard payment terms and have a short period to maturity less than one year.
the unsecured loan stock is repayable at book value on three months notice being given to the Company.
the carrying value of bank loans and overdrafts equates to their fair value.
other non-current liabilities principally comprise long-term land creditors which are held at their discounted present value calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and yields as appropriate.
the discount rate applied reflects the nominal, risk-free pre-tax rate at the balance sheet date, applied to the maturity profile of the individual land creditors within the total.
FINANCIALS FINANCIALS NoteS to the CoNSoLIDAteD FINANCIAL StAtemeNtS 72 Notes to the CoNsolidated fiNaNCial statemeNts CoNtiNued 25 CApItAL mANAgemeNt, treASury poLICy AND FINANCIAL INStrumeNtS CoNtiNued Liquidity risk this is the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available.
Group management addresses this risk through review of rolling cash flow forecasts throughout the year to assess and monitor the current and forecast availability of funding, and to ensure sufficient headroom against facility limits and compliance with banking covenants.
the contractual undiscounted maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, included at their balance sheet carrying value in the tables above, is as follows: 2008 2007 Restated 000 000 in less than one year 510,613 450,989 in more than one year but not more than two years 20,240 32,504 in more than two years but not more than five years 24,653 42,274 in more than five years 10,565 566,071 525,767 market risk as the Group is not exposed to currency risk, the principal market risk to which the Group is exposed is interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
the Group does not have any fixed rate borrowings.
the Groups rolling cash flow forecasts incorporate appropriate interest assumptions, and management carefully assesses expected activity levels and associated funding requirements in the prevailing and forecast interest rate environment to ensure that this risk is managed.
from time to time the Group uses derivative instruments, when commercially appropriate, to manage interest rate risk by altering the interest rates on investments and funding so that the resulting exposure gives greater certainty of future costs.
if interest rates on the Groups cash balances and borrowings had been 50 basis points higher throughout the year ended 30 april 2008, profit after tax for the year would have been 78,000 higher 2007: 562,000. this calculation is based on the monthly closing net debt position throughout the financial year.
the Groups loan stock amounts to 85,000 2007: 85,000 and so no sensitivity analysis has been prepared against this interest-bearing financial liability as any impact would not be material.
Committed borrowing facilities the Group has committed borrowing facilities, all at floating rates linked to liBoR, as follows: 2008 2007 Available Drawn undrawn termination available drawn undrawn termination 000 000 000 Date 000 000 000 date secured revolving credit facility 800,000 4,464 795,536 Aug-11 375,000 375,000 aug-11 364 day revolving facility 50,000 9,283 40,717 Jun-07 Revolving facility 50,000 50,000 aug-08 Revolving facility 100,000 50,000 50,000 aug-08 800,000 4,464 795,536 575,000 59,283 515,717 the secured revolving credit facility is secured by debentures provided by certain group holding companies over their assets.
