Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Groups approach to management of financial risks together with sensitivity analysis is set out on pages 31 to 35.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging future floating interest rate movements on its term bank debt.
The Group has fixed interest rates on around 96% of the interest rate exposure on the indebtedness under the senior credit facilities using interest rate swaps over the period to March 2010 and around 55% thereafter to March 2011.
The Group has also entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge known cross border cash flows early in the next financial year.
The hedges give rise to the following balances reported on the balance sheets: At 31 March 2008 2007 Book Fair Book Fair a a millions value value value value b Derivatives : Interest swaps - Non-current asset 2.0 2.0 23.7 23.7 Interest swaps - Current asset 2.6 2.6 6.0 6.0 Foreign exchange contract - Current asset 1.1 1.1 Interest swaps - Current liabilities 37.4 37.4 0.3 0.3 Interest swaps - Non-current liabilities 58.2 58.2 12.7 12.7 a The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in forced liquidation or sale.
b The gross notional amount of interest rate swaps was 15.6 billion fixing rates on average for 325 days 2007 -12.1 billion fixing rates on average for 318 days and the gross notional amount of foreign exchange contracts was 11.1 billion 2007 - nil.
The carrying value of the above derivative financial instruments equals their fair value.
Fair values are determined by using market data and the use of established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
The maximum exposure to credit risk relating to derivative financial instruments at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.
The Group has reviewed all its material contracts for embedded derivatives, for which separate accounting would be required, and has concluded that there are no material embedded derivatives.
