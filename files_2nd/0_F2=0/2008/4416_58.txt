May 2005 DAB grant Following determination of the bonus for 200 -200, the Group initially calculated the number of investment shares that participants would receive by dividing half of the bonus post a notional tax rate for French employees, half of bonus before tax was used by the share price on 23 March 200 2.99.
Participants were then granted a maximum matching award of shares on a ratio of 1:1 based on the gross value of the investment shares received.
According to the original criteria, the number of matching shares that vested would depend on Kesas TSR performance against a comparator group drawn from companies in the FTSE 2 0 and measured over a four-year period from grant date.
May 2005 PSP grant The PSP consisted of a base award equal to 30 per cent of basic salary, with up to a further 20 per cent potentially available depending on individual personal performance.
Under the terms of the May 200 grant, awards of rights to shares equivalent to between 30 per cent and 0 per cent of the eligible executives basic salary were made, based on individual performance.
The awards are subject to the same TSR performance conditions as those applying to the DAB shares as explained above.
The fair value of awards within the DAB and PSP were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
The fair value of awards granted and the assumptions used in the calculation were as follows: Grant date 22 May 200 Share price at grant date 2.70 Exercise price nil Number of employees 21 Number of shares in scheme 00,307 Vesting period years Expected volatility 22% Option life N A Expected life years Risk-free rate.
