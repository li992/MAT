ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of the principal policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year, is set out below: a Basis of Accounting These financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of fixed asset investments and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice 2003 revised 2005 regarding the Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies SORP.
b Valuation of Investments Upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, including expenses incidental to purchase.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value which is bid market price for listed investments.
Unquoted investments are included at a valuation determined by the Directors after discussion with the Investment Manager on the basis of the latest accounting and other relevant information.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains or losses on disposal are included in the capital column of the income statement within Gains losses from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
Year-end exchange rates are used to translate the value of investments which are denominated in foreign currencies.
c Foreign Currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year-end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year-end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in capital reserve.
Foreign exchange movements on fixed asset investments are included in the Income Statement within gains losses on investments.
d Income Investment income, which includes related taxation, has been accounted for on an ex-dividend basis or when the Companys right to the income is established.
Interest receivable on deposits is accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged as follows: the basic investment management fee is charged wholly to revenue: any investment performance bonus payable to Baring Asset Management Limited is charged wholly to capital: dealing costs are charged wholly to capital: and other expenses are charged wholly to revenue.
37 Baring Emerging Europe PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued f Interest Payable Interest payable is accounted for on an accruals basis, and is charged wholly to revenue.
g Capital Reserve With effect from 1 October 2007, changes in fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without adverse terms held at the balance sheet date are included in realised, rather than unrealised, capital reserves.
Prior to this date they were held as unrealised capital reserves.
The prior year comparative figures have not been changed to take into effect this change in treatment.
h Special reserve Pursuant to a special resolution passed on 8 November 2002, the Companys application to reduce its share premium account was approved by the High Court and registered with the Registrar of Companies on 18 December 2002.
The amount of the reduction was 86,624,982, representing the share premium arising on the issue of shares by the Company on 17 December 2002.
This amount was transferred to a special reserve which is available for the repurchase by the Company of its own shares.
i Taxation The charge for taxation is based upon the net revenue for the year.
The tax charge is allocated to the revenue and capital accounts according to the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are first matched against taxable income arising in the revenue account: the effect of this for the year ended 30 September 2008 was that all the deductions for tax purposes went to the revenue account.
Deferred taxation will be recognised as an asset or a liability if transactions have occurred at the balance sheet date that give rise to an obligation to pay more taxation in the future, or a right to pay less taxation in the future.
An asset will not be recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefit is uncertain.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE Baring Asset Management Limited Barings acts as Investment Manager of the Company under an agreement terminable by either party giving not less than six months written notice.
Under this agreement Barings receives a basic fee charged to revenue which is calculated monthly and payable at an annual rate of 0.8% of the net asset value of the Company.
The Directors have decided upon a policy of non-allocation of the investment management fees and as such they have been charged wholly to the revenue account.
In addition under the agreement Barings is entitled to a performance fee charged to capital which is payable at the rate of 10% of the amount by which the change in the Companys net asset value on a total return basis exceeds the benchmark.
The performance fee is capped at 0.6% of the net asset value of the Company on the first day of the performance period.

The ultimate holding company of Barings is Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company.
RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long-term so as to secure its investment objective stated on page 3.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
These risks, include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk, and other price risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk, and the Directors approach to the management of them are set out below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks, that are set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period.
a Market Risk Special considerations and risk factors associated with the Companys investments are discussed on page 4.
The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk see b below, interest rate risk see c below and other price risk see d below.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which have remained substantially unchanged from those applying in the year ended 30 September 2007.
The Companys Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
b Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities, and income, are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency, and in which it reports its results.
As a result, movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and the currencies of the countries in which the Company invests, which are identified in the table shown in note 9, may affect the sterling value of those items.
In addition the Companys univested cash balances are usually held in US dollars.
45 Baring Emerging Europe PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued Management of the risk The Investment Manager monitors the Companys exposure and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposures At 30 September 2008 monetary assets included cash balances totalling 5,879,000 2007: 13,549,000 that were held in US dollars.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the equity in regard to the Companys monetary financial assets to changes in the exchange rates for the various currencies too which the Company is exposed.
If sterling had weakened by an average of 10%, this would have had the following effect: 2008 2007 000 000 Income statement profit after taxation: Revenue return 505 101 Capital return 8,710 10,482 Total profit after taxation for the year 9,215 10,583 Equity 9,215 10,583 If sterling had strengthened by an average of 10%, this would have had the following effect: 2008 2007 000 000 Income statement profit after taxation: Revenue return 505 101 Capital return 8,710 10,482 Total profit after taxation for the year 9,215 10,583 Equity 9,215 10,583 c Interest Rate Risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits.
Cash at bank at 30 September 2008 and 30 September 2007 was held at floating interesting rates, linked to current short-term market rates.
46 Baring Emerging Europe PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued d Other Price Risk Other price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and unquoted equity investments.
Management of the risk The Board of Directors believe that as the Companys investment objective is to provide exposure to Emerging European Securities its neutral position in respect of this risk is full exposure to the market as represented by its benchmark.
The Investment Manager has been given discretion around the benchmark to enable it to add value.
The amount by which the portfolio diverges from the benchmark is closely monitored by the Board with the goal of ensuring that the risk taken is proportionate to the value added.
Concentration of exposure to other price risks A sector breakdown and geographical allocation of the portfolio is contained in the Investment Managers Report on pages 14 and 15.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the equity to an increase or decrease of 10% in the fair values of the Companys equities.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
Increase in Decrease in Increase in Decrease in fair value fair value fair value fair value 2008 2008 2007 2007 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after taxation: Capital return increase decrease 27,070 27,070 37,041 37,041 Total profit after taxation increase decrease 27,070 27,070 37,041 37,041 Equity 27,070 27,070 37,041 37,041 e Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities that are readily realisable.
The Board gives guidance to the Investment Manager as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one holding.
The policy is that the Company should remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short-term borrowing be used to manage short-term cash requirements.
47 Baring Emerging Europe PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued f Credit Risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk This risk is not significant, and is managed as follows: the majority of transactions take place through clearing houses on a delivery versus payment basis: investment transactions are carried out with an approved list of brokers, whose credit-standing is reviewed periodically by the Investment Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: and cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
None of the Companys financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
g Fair Values of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments and derivatives, or the balance sheet amount if it is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, due to brokers, accruals and cash balances.
CONTINGENT ASSET On 28 June 2007 the European Court of Justice announced that it had found in favour of the Association of Investment Companies and JPMorgan Claverhouse Trust plc in declaring that management expenses of investment trusts should be exempt from VAT.
Her Majestys Customs and Revenue HMRC subsequently announced that it had accepted that fund management services are exempt from VAT and it withdrew from the appeal in the JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust case.
The Company is therefore no longer charged VAT on management fees and it is expected that it will be able to recover some or all of the VAT previously charged on management fees.
Clarification as to how claims for past VAT will be processed is awaited from HMRC.
Since its launch in December 2002 to 30 September 2007 the Company paid approximately 1.6 million of VAT on its management fees and recovered approximately 0.4 million of this through its quarterly VAT returns.
We are hoping to recover a significant proportion of the 1.2 million net loss of VAT.
This potential recovery of VAT has not been recognised in the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2008.
