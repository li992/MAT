Employees are entitled to receive dividends on the shares held in trust for as long as they remain employees.
On 3 May 2005, the SIP awarded all UK employees, except executive directors, a total of 94,267 free shares which vested immediately and 470,758 additional free shares which vest after three years.
The price of ordinary shares on the award date was 1.20.
On 24 August 2006, the Company invited all UK employees to subscribe for up to 1,500 of partnership shares when the share price was 2.38.
IG offered to match every partnership share with 2 matching shares up to a maximum of 3,000.
The matching shares vest after three years.
On 24 July 2007, the Company invited all UK employees to subscribe for up to 1,500 of partnership shares when the share price was 3.36.
IG offered to match every partnership share with 1 matching share up to a maximum of 1,500.
Shadow SIP awards made to non-UK staff Shadow SIP awards are made to overseas staff and are cash settled.
The fair value of these awards is estimated at the grant date using the BlackScholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions of the award.
A liability is recognised over the expected vesting period and until the liability is settled it is re-measured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
On 9 December 2005, Australian employees were awarded a total of 45,000 shares which settled on a cash basis on 31 May 2008.
There were no further performance conditions other than remaining in employment with IG for the term of the award.
At the vesting date a bonus was payable to each participant equivalent to the value of 2,500 IG shares at 31 May 2008.
The number of awards vesting was the equivalent of 37,500 shares.
LTIP awards LTIPs allow the award of nil cost or nominal cost shares.
UK employees awards for the years ended 31 May 2005 and 31 May 2007 automatically crystallised on the vesting date.
During the year ended 31 May 2008, these awards were modified at the Companys discretion, to offer employees the opportunity to convert all or a proportion of their shares entitlement under the initial share award plans to share options.
The modification had no impact on the income statement.
LTIP awards made in the year ended 31 May 2008 and to Australian employees are legally categorised as options.
The fair value of awards made to UK staff for the years ended 31 May 2005 and 2007 is the price of ordinary shares at the grant date adjusted for the present value of future dividends to which the holder is not entitled.
The fair values of awards made in the year ended 31 May 2008 and to Australian employees for earlier years are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Performance is measured as the compound annual growth rate in fully diluted earnings per share over the three year vesting period and also share price growth over the same period for awards made in the year ended 31 May 2008.
For each award a minimum performance target must be achieved before any shares vest and the awards vest fully once the maximum performance target is achieved.

The weighted average fair value of cash-settled awards which were granted in the year were nil at the grant date 2007 - 73,800.
The following table lists the inputs to a Black-Scholes option pricing model used in calculating the liability: Balance sheet date 31 May 2008 31 May 2007 Underlying share price pence 382.25 330.75 Expected volatility % 48 31 Risk-free interest rate % 5.00 5.50 Expected life of awards years 0.00 1.00 The expected life of the awards is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of the awards were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
Fair value of equity-settled awards The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the grant date.
The weighted average fair value of the equity settled awards granted during the year was 7,548,086 2007 - 4,030,659 at the grant date.
For SIP awards, the fair value is determined to be the share price at the grant date without making an adjustment for expected dividends as awardees are entitled to dividends over the vesting period.
For LTIP awards made to UK staff in the years ended 31 May 2005 and 31 May 2007, the fair value is determined to be the share price at the grant date after a deduction for the expected present value of future dividends over the vesting period.
LTIP awards made to Australian staff for these periods and awards made in the year ended 31 May 2008 are legally categorised as options and the fair value was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, using the following inputs: Grant date 16 May 2005 7 Aug 2006 23 July 2007 Share price at grant date pence 112.25p 217.0p 312.25p Expected life of awards years 3.18 2.97 3.00 Risk-free interest rate % 5.00 5.00 5.75 Expected volatility % 34 32 32 Expected dividend yield % 3.73 3.04 3.42
