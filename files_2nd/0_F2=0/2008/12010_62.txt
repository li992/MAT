During 2007 the period for repayment of these liabilities was extended with an agreement to deposit with the lessor group amounts equal to the difference between the original and revised payments due.
The accumulated deposits, 10.1 million at 31 March 2008 2007 4.1 million, are being held to settle the liability over the period from the end of the original lease term.
The deposits are subject to a registered charge given as security to the lessor for the balance outstanding.
