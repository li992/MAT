The amount of deferred tax assets unrecognised at 31 December 2008 is 8,617,000 2007: 9,574,000.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of a further 16.2 million 2007: 31.7 million of unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the differences and either it is possible that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future or no tax is payable on the reversal.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12, Income Taxes during the year are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
