Share premium and special reserve On 10 December 2003, the High Court approved a reduction in the Companys share premium account of 1,120 million, as approved by the Companys shareholders at the AGM held on 14 November 2003.
This amount was equal to the Company-only profit and loss account reserve deficit at 30 June 2003.
As part of the application, the Companys balance sheet at 30 September 2003 was required to be presented.
At that date, the deficit on the Company-only profit and loss account reserve had reduced by 14 million since 30 June 2003, to 1,106 million.
As a condition of the reduction, the reduction in the share premium account of 1,120 million was permitted to be offset against the profit and loss account reserve by the amount of the deficit at 30 September 2003.
The excess of 14 million was credited to a special reserve, and, under theterms of the reduction, will remain undistributable until all the creditors of the Company and its guarantors as at 10 December 2003 are paid.
Purchase of own equity shares for cancellation and capital redemption reserve On 4 November 2005, the Companys shareholders approved a resolution at the AGM for the Company to purchase up to 92 million ordinary shares the 2005 resolution.
This authority to buyback shares expired on 3 November 2006.
During the year ended 30 June 2007, the Company purchased, and subsequently cancelled, 38 million ordinary shares at an average price of 5.55, with a nominal value of 20 million, for a consideration of 214 million including stamp duty and commission of 2 million.
The nominal value of the shares cancelled has been credited to other reserves.
The following table provides information about purchases of equity shares by the company, including purchases by the Groups ESOP, during the scal year.
