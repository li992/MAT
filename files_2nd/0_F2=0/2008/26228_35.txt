Group Financial Statements 2 Supplementary operating profit information This supplementary operating profit information provides further analysis of the results reported under IFRS and we believe gives shareholders a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
Supplementary IFRS operating profit is one of the Groups key performance indicators.
New IFRS 8 segmentation has been adopted for 2008 to further improve shareholders understanding of the Groups performance.
The comparatives have been reclassified to reflect these changes.
