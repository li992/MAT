Basis of preparation and consolidation The consolidated financial statements the statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed and adopted for use by the European Union.
These statements have been prepared using all standards and interpretations required for financial periods beginning 1 January 2008.
No standards or interpretations have been adopted before the required implementation date.
No new, amended or revised standards were required to be applied to these statements.
IFRIC 11 and 14 have been applied to these statements with no impact.
IFRIC 12 also became effective but is not relevant.
These statements have been prepared under the historical cost method except where other measurement bases are required to be applied under IFRS as set out below.
Basis of consolidation The statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group and the Groups share of the results and equity of its joint ventures.
Subsidiaries are entities over which, either directly or indirectly, the Company has control through the power to govern financial operating policies so as to obtain benefit from their activities.
Except as noted below, this power is accompanied by a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included in the Groups results from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
All business combinations are accounted for by the purchase method.
Assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value.
In a single case the Company indirectly owns 100% of the voting share capital of an entity but is precluded from exercising either control or joint control by a contractual agreement with the United States Department of Defense.
In accordance with IAS 27 this entity has been excluded from the consolidation and treated as an investment.
Further details are contained in note 14.
Intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated.
Minority interests represent the portion of shareholders earnings and equity attributable to third party shareholders.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are entities in which the Group has a long term interest and exercises joint control with its partners over their financial and operating policies.
In all cases voting rights are 50% or lower.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method.
The Groups share of equity includes goodwill arising on acquisition.
The Groups share of profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and joint ventures are eliminated.
Foreign currencies Subsidiaries and joint ventures account in the currency of their primary economic environment of operation, determined having regard to the currency which mainly influences sales revenue and input costs.
Transactions are translated at exchange rates approximating to the rate ruling on the date of the transaction except in the case of material transactions where actual spot rate may be used if it more accurately reflects the underlying substance of the transaction.
Where practicable, transactions involving foreign currencies are protected by forward contracts.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Material foreign currency movements arising on the translation of intra-group balances treated as part of the net investment in a subsidiary are recognised through equity.
Movements on other intra-group balances are recognised through the income statement.
The Groups presentational currency is sterling.
On consolidation, results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures are translated to sterling at average exchange rates.
Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profits and losses on the realisation of currency net investments include the accumulated net exchange differences that have arisen on the retranslation of the currency net investments since 1 January 2004 up to the date of realisation.
Presentation of the income statement IFRS is not fully prescriptive as to the format of the income statement.
Line items and subtotals have been presented on the face of the income statement in addition to those required under IFRS.
Sales shown in the income statement are those of continuing subsidiaries.
Operating profit is profit or loss before discontinued operations, taxation, finance costs and the share of post-tax profit of joint ventures accounted for using the equity method.
In order to achieve consistency and comparability between reporting periods, operating profit is analysed to show separately the results of normal trading performance and individually significant charges and credits.
Such items arise because of their size or nature and, in 2008, comprise: 78 GKN plc Annual Report 2008 15860GKNPLC BACK A. indd 78 15860GKNPLC BACK A. indd 78 09 03 2009 15:58 09 03 2009 15:58 15860 09 03 2009 Proof 12 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements charges relating to the Group-wide restructuring programmes announced in 2004 and 2008: the impact of the annual goodwill impairment review: asset impairment and restructuring charges which arise from events which are significant to any reportable segment: amortisation of the fair value of non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations: profits or losses on businesses sold or closed which do not meet the definition of discontinued operations or which the Group views as capital rather than revenue in nature: and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments between the opening and closing balance sheets and material currency translation movement arising on intra-group funding transactions.
The Groups post-tax share of joint venture profits is shown as a separate component of profit before tax.
Material restructuring and impairment charges are separately identified.
Net finance costs are analysed to show separately interest payable, interest receivable and the net of interest payable on post-employment obligations and the expected return on pension scheme assets.
Revenue recognition Sales Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable which generally equates to the invoiced amount, excluding sales taxes and net of allowances for returns, early settlement discounts and rebates.
Invoices for goods are raised when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed which, dependent upon contractual terms, may be at the point of despatch, acceptance by the customer or, in Aerospace, certification by the customer.
Revenue from royalties and the rendering of services is not significant.
Certain businesses, principally those in Powder Metallurgy, recognise an element of revenue via a surcharge mechanism.
The surcharge invoiced or credited is generally based on prior period movement in raw material price indices applied to current period deliveries.
In those instances where recovery of such increases is guaranteed, irrespective of the level of future deliveries, revenue is recognised, or due allowance made, in the same period as the cost movement takes place.
Other income Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
Revenue from dividends is not significant.
Sales and other income is recognised in the income statement when it can be reliably measured and its collectability is reasonably assured.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges.
Cost Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use.
Where freehold and long leasehold properties were carried at a valuation at 23 March 2000, these values have been retained as book values and therefore deemed cost at the date of the IFRS transition.
Borrowing costs are not capitalised.
Where assets are in the course of construction at the balance sheet date they are classified as capital work in progress.
Transfers are made to other asset categories when they are available for use.
Depreciation Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or capital work in progress.
In the case of all other categories of property, plant and equipment, depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the course of the financial year from the date the asset is available for use.
Depreciation is applied to specific classes of asset so as to reduce them to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed annually.
The range of main rates of depreciation used are: Years Freehold buildings Up to 50 Steel powder production plant 18 General plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 6 to 15 Computers 3 to 5 Commercial vehicles and cars 4 to 5 www.

Impairments are charged to the income statement.
Similarly, where property, plant and equipment has been impaired and subsequent reviews demonstrate the recoverable value is in excess of the impaired value an impairment reversal is recorded.
The amount of the reversal cannot exceed the theoretical net book amount at the date of the reversal had the item not been impaired.
Impairment reversals are credited to the income statement against the same line item to which the impairment was previously charged.
Costs attributable to leasehold properties are written off to profit by equal annual instalments over the period of the lease or 50 years, whichever is the shorter.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement as incurred over the lease term.
Where fixed assets are financed by leasing arrangements which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitment is shown as a finance lease liability.
The asset and liability are measured at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and capital which reduces the outstanding obligation.
The asset is depreciated or amortised in line with similar owned assets.
Discontinued operations The profit or loss on discontinued operations comprises the trading results up to the date of disposal or discontinuance and the profit or loss on the disposal or closure where businesses are sold or closed by the date on which the financial statements are approved.
A discontinued operation is a business or businesses that have either been disposed of or closed or satisfies the criteria to be classified as held for sale and that represents either a material line of business within the Group or within one of its reported segments or a primary geographical area of operation.
Where businesses fall to be treated as discontinued in the current year the comparative data is reclassified to reflect those businesses as discontinued.
Financial assets and liabilities Borrowings are measured initially at fair value which usually equates to proceeds received and includes transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and overdrafts together with highly liquid investments of less than three months maturity.
Unless an enforceable right of set-off exists and there is an intention to net settle, the components of cash and cash equivalents are reflected on a gross basis in the balance sheet.
The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities, including short term receivables and payables, are stated at amortised cost less any impairment provision unless the impact of the time value of money is considered to be material.
Derivative financial instruments The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments including forward foreign exchange contracts are used by the Group to manage its exposure to i risk associated with the variability in cash flows in relation to both recognised assets or liabilities or forecast transactions and ii changes in the value of the Groups net investment in overseas operations.
All derivative financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value.
Where derivative financial instruments are not designated as or not determined to be effective hedges, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the income statement.
Where derivative financial instruments are designated as and are effective as cash flow hedges, any gain or loss on remeasurement is held in equity and recycled through the income statement when the designated item is transacted.
Remeasurement gains and losses on derivative financial instruments held as net investment hedges are recognised in equity via the statement of recognised income and expense to the extent it is effective until the instrument and the underlying hedged investment are sold, when the profit or loss arising is recognised in the income statement.
Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments no longer designated as effective hedges are taken directly to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised at their fair value when the nature, characteristics and risks of the derivative are not closely related to the host contract.
Gains and losses arising on the remeasurement of these embedded derivatives at each balance sheet date are taken to the income statement.
80 GKN plc Annual Report 2008 15860GKNPLC BACK A. indd 80 15860GKNPLC BACK A. indd 80 09 03 2009 15:58 09 03 2009 15:58 15860 09 03 2009 Proof 12 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Goodwill Goodwill consists of the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible assets net of the fair value of the liabilities including contingencies of businesses acquired at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill in respect of business combinations of subsidiaries is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Where negative goodwill arises, following reassessment of fair values, it is credited to the income statement in the period in which the acquisition is made.
Goodwill is not amortised but tested at least annually for impairment.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses that arise from the annual assessment of its carrying value.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, determined as the higher of estimated discounted future net cash flows or recoverable amount on a fair value less cost to sell basis, goodwill is written down to the recoverable amount and an impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.
Computer software Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised and categorised as intangible assets.
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use.
Amortisation is provided on a straight line basis over its economic useful life which is in the range of 35 years.
Development costs Where development expenditure results in a new or substantially improved product or process and it is probable that this expenditure will be recovered it is capitalised.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use.
In Aerospace, amortisation is charged over the assets life up to maximum of fifteen years either on a straight line basis or, where sufficient contractual terms exist, a unit of production method is applied.
In Automotive, amortisation is charged on a straight line basis over the assets life up to a maximum of seven years.
Capitalised development costs are subject to annual impairment reviews.
Research expenditure is written off as incurred.
Assets acquired on business combinations non-operating intangible assets Non-operating intangible assets are intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination, which arise from contractual or other legal rights and are not transferable or separable.
On initial recognition they are measured at fair value.
Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis to the income statement over their expected useful lives which are: Years Marketing related assets brands and trademarks 3050 agreements not to complete Life of agreement Customer related assets 215 Technology based assets 510 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value with due allowance being made for obsolete or slow-moving items.
Cost is determined on a first in, first out or weighted average cost basis.
Cost includes raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and the relevant proportion of works overheads assuming normal levels of activity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated selling costs and costs to complete.
Taxation Current and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement unless they relate to items recognised directly in equity when the related tax is also recognised in equity.
Full provision is made for deferred tax on all temporary timing differences resulting from the difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability in the consolidated financial statements and its tax base.
The amount of deferred tax reflects the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted profits of joint ventures.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted profits of overseas branches and subsidiaries except to the extent that it is probable that such earnings will be remitted to the parent in the foreseeable future.

In the UK and in certain overseas companies pension arrangements are made through externally funded defined benefit schemes, the contributions to which are based on the advice of independent actuaries or in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
In other overseas companies funds are retained within the business to provide for retirement obligations.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit arrangements which provide certain employees with defined postemployment healthcare benefits.
The Group accounts for all post-employment defined benefit schemes through full recognition of the schemes surpluses or deficits on the balance sheet at the end of each year.
Actuarial gains and losses are included in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Current and past service costs, curtailments and settlements are recognised within operating profit.
Returns on scheme assets and interest on obligations are recognised as a component of other net financing charges.
For defined contribution arrangements the cost charged to the income statement represents the Groups contributions to the relevant schemes in the period in which they fall due.
Share-based payments Share options granted to employees and share-based arrangements put in place since 7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or award using an appropriate option pricing model and are charged to operating profit over the performance or vesting period of the scheme.
The annual charge is modified to take account of shares forfeited by employees who leave during the performance or vesting period and, in the case of nonmarket related performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely the option will vest.
Government grants Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the grant are met.
Where they relate to specific assets they are amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the asset is depreciated.
Where they relate to revenue expenditure and or non-asset criteria they are taken to the income statement to match the period in which the expenditure is incurred and criteria met.
Treasury shares GKN shares which have been purchased and not cancelled are held as treasury shares and deducted from shareholders equity.
Dividends The annual final dividend is not provided for until approved at the annual general meeting whilst interim dividends are charged in the period they are paid.
Standards, revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations issued but not yet applied The Group does not intend to adopt any standard, revision or amendment before the required implementation date.
The following standards and amendments are likely to impact the reporting of the Groups results, assets and liabilities.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments was issued in November 2006 and is required to be implemented from 1 January 2009.
It requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker, as defined in the standard, to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance, and supersedes IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
The effect of this standard on Group disclosures is still to be fully determined.
IAS 23 Amendments Borrowing Costs came into effect on 1 January 2009.
The Group will apply this standard prospectively.
Currently the Group has no borrowings directly attributable to qualifying assets.
In relation to an Aerospace investment programme the Group is currently in discussion with third parties on funding options which may result in borrowing costs, directly attributable to qualifying assets, being capitalised.
It is not yet possible to quantify the impact of this.

IAS 38 Amendments regarding methods of amortisation and recognition of prepaid goods and services.
IAS 19 Amendment regarding difference between past service cost and curtailment, definition of return on plan assets and long and short term employee benefits.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
IAS 31 Amendment regarding joint ventures accounted for in accordance with IAS 39.
IAS 20 Amendment regarding the benefit of a below-market rate government loan.
There are a number of standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are not relevant to the Group which have therefore not been listed above.
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The Groups significant accounting policies are set out above.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the use of estimates, subjective judgement and assumptions that may affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported profit and earnings for the year.
The Directors base these estimates, judgements and assumptions on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstance.
The accounting policies where the Directors consider the more complex estimates, judgements and assumptions have to be made are those in respect of acquired non-operating intangible assets business combinations note 24, post-employment obligations note 26, derivative and other financial instruments notes 3e and 20, taxation note 5 and impairment of non-current assets notes 11 and 12.
The details of the principal estimates, judgements and assumptions made are set out in the related notes as identified.

These costs were incurred in Driveline operations in North America and Europe and were charged in the first half of 2008.
In response to the severe economic downturn in our automotive markets and in anticipation of activity reductions in both off-highway and aerospace markets, the Group commenced further restructuring in the final quarter of 2008.
As a result of this planned restructuring, charges amounting to 149 million in subsidiaries and an impairment in respect of joint venture investments, 10 million, have been recognised.
Cash based charges amount to 20 million.
An analysis by segment and description of the 2008 restructuring plan charges is set out as follows: www.

In Powder Metallurgy impairments of 100 million include the impact on the Sinter Metals North American fixed asset base 81 million on the back of significant reductions in automotive volume projections and reductions to estimated realisable values of the fixed assets and inventories 11 million in Hoeganaes attributable to two businesses that are being exited.
In Driveline impairments are attributable to the rationalisation of UK manufacturing capacity 10 million and write-offs of dedicated customer programme specific fixed assets arising on the programme cancellation or volume reductions 5 million.
In Aerospace the reduction of engine component production capacity in Europe as a result of transfers to the US, in agreement with specific customers, has resulted in fixed asset write-downs of 3 million.
As a consequence of intractable losses, severe volume reductions and forecast cash outflows into the foreseeable future in our UK Other Automotive subsidiary business the entire production fixed asset base has been impaired 11 million.
The Sinter North America and UK Other Automotive impairment, 81 million and 11 million respectively, were determined on a value in use basis where the pre-tax discount rates used were 10% and 12%.
Impairments recognised in respect of joint ventures reflect a change in how Driveline will satisfy customer supply in selected geographical territories.
Consequently, joint venture arrangements are being unwound and the carrying value of the Groups investment therein has been fully impaired.
Non-asset related 2008 plan charges are predominantly employee related and include short-time working costs of 2 million, redundancy charges of 14 million including 1 million attributable pension past service costs and other reorganisation costs of 4 million.
Other reorganisation costs include 2 million of charges in respect of an onerous consumables supply lease that arose as a consequence of the curtailment of activity in a Powder Metallurgy site.
Redundancy costs provided represent charges for contractual severance, other employee related exit costs and post-employment augmentation where applicable.
These charges have only been recognised where formal communication with the employees or relevant employee bodies had taken place before 31 December 2008.
Short-time working represents payments made to employees in the period when they are away from the workplace and not engaged in any productive or non-productive activities in the plants affected, and therefore are not contributing to the business operations.
The 2007 restructuring charges of 33 million relate to the Groups 2004 restructuring programme to facilitate geographical migration of Driveline production capacity, support recovery actions in Powder Metallurgy and the realignment and reduction of production capacity, overhead and infrastructure cost across the Group.
Pension past service charges included therein amounted to 4 million in the year.
Other reorganisation charges were net of a 2 million property surplus in a Powder Metallurgy business sold post-restructuring closure.
Cash outflow in respect of 2008, 2004 and earlier periods strategic restructuring actions amounted to 28 million 2007 40 million including 4 million property disposal proceeds.
Other impairments The 2 million impairment reversal recognised in 2007 arose in relation to the Groups UK cylinder liner manufacturing operation.
The business disposed of land and buildings and plant and machinery at a value greater than the theoretical net book value of the assets had they not been impaired.
Consequently, a proportion of the previously recognised impairment has been reversed.

This requires an estimation of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of differing accounting and tax treatments.
These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse.
Recognition of deferred tax assets, and hence credits to the income statement, is based on forecast future taxable income and therefore involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of particular legal entities or tax groups in which the deferred tax assets are recognised.
The Group is subject to many different tax jurisdictions and tax rules as a consequence of its geographic spread.
It is therefore subject to tax audits and tax reviews which, by their nature, are often complex and can require several years to conclude.
The total accrual for income tax in any period is, therefore, based on management judgement, interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of crystallisation and settlement.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable.
As amounts set aside in any period could differ from actual tax liabilities, adjustments may be required in subsequent periods which may have a material impact on the Groups income statement and or cash tax payment.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items with tax authorities and, as a result, there can be substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and cash tax payments.
Interest on provisions for uncertain tax positions is, where relevant, provided for in the tax charge.
Details of the effective tax rate for the Group and the underlying events and transactions affecting this are given in the business review on pages 14 and 15.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries except where the distribution of such profits is planned.
If the earnings were remitted in full tax of 28 million 2007 25 million would be payable.
f Franked Investment Income Litigation In September 2003 GKN filed a claim in the High Court of England and Wales the High Court in respect of various Advance Corporation Tax payments made and Corporate Tax paid on certain foreign dividend receipts which, in its view, were levied by HMRC in breach of GKNs EU community law rights.
GKN joined a Group Litigation Order GLO with several other claimants and a test case was selected from the members of the GLO to proceed to trial on a representative basis.
At the commencement of that trial in June 2004 the High Court referred the test case to the European Court of Justice ECJ for guidance on the issues raised.
In December 2006 the ECJ issued its guidance to the High Court and the test case returned to the High Court for the full trial in July 2008.
The High Court issued its judgment on 27 November 2008.
The November High Court judgment held in favour of the claimants on certain key aspects of the claim.
Both parties, however, have appealed to the Court of Appeal and depending upon the outcome of this a further reference to the ECJ may be required before the issue is ultimately resolved.
Given the importance of the matters at issue it is expected that appeals will ultimately be taken to the House of Lords and that this process may take several more years to complete.
Given the complexity of the case and uncertainty over the issues raised it is not possible to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty what the final outcome could be.
The range of possible outcomes is so wide that it is potentially misleading to quote any estimates of the possible recoveries at this stage.
As a result no contingent asset has been recognised and disclosed in these financial statements.

Under the agreement the 35 million, together with accrued interest, was shared equally.
As a result, 21 million was received, of which 3 million was recognised as interest and 18 million recognised as profit on sale of discontinued operations.
The interest represents the cumulative interest on the escrow monies earned during the period from initial disposal to final agreement.
Tax of 5 million was charged against the profit on sale.

Where grants were made after 7 November 2002 they have been accounted for as required by IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
As permitted by the transitional arrangements of that standard, awards made before that date have not been so accounted.
All options have been valued at the date of grant by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo model which uses the same principle as a binomial model.
No new awards were made in 2008.
Details of awards made since 7 November 2002 are: a Employee Sharesave Scheme In September 2003 the Company awarded options to UK employees under an approved Sharesave scheme, the terms of which were that the employee entered into regular savings commitment up to a maximum of 250 per month for a three year period.
The cumulative savings were then used to acquire options over a number of shares at a 10% discount to market price at the date of grant.
There were no performance conditions but, in general, the employee must remain in employment for the three year period.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price 229p, volatility 38%, expected dividend yield 4.3%, risk-free interest rate 4.49% and a term of 3.25 years.
There have been no further awards since September 2003. b Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004, April 2005 and April 2006 under the 2004 scheme.
In April 2007 awards were made to Directors under the 2004 scheme.
Under both schemes options were granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant and subject to meeting performance conditions over a three year period.
In the case of the 2001 scheme, the performance condition was based on earnings per share eps growth whilst under the 2004 scheme the condition is based on Total Shareholder Return TSR compared with that of comparator companies.
Under the 2001 scheme only, where the performance condition is not satisfied in full after the first three years, retesting is carried out each year up to six years from the date of grant.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price 163p to 380.3p, volatility 31% to 38%, expected dividend yield 3.3% to 6.2%, riskfree interest rate 4.28% to 5.40% and expected terms of 6.4 years to 6.7 years.
c Long Term Incentive Plans LTIP Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004, April 2006 and April 2007 under the 2004 scheme.
In April 2005 awards were made to Directors under the 2004 scheme.
Under both schemes, options were granted subject to TSR performance over a three year period compared with a comparator group.
There is no retest facility under either scheme.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price nil, volatility 23% to 39%, expected dividend yield 3.3% to 6.2%, risk-free interest rate 4.05% to 5.40% and a term of 3 years to 4 years 9.5 months.
d Bonus Co-Investment Plan BCIP Under the Bonus Co-Investment Plan, certain senior employees excluding Directors were entitled to use up to 10% of their gross short term annual bonus potential to purchase shares in the Company at market price.
Provided they remain in employment for three years and the shares are retained for that period the Company matches those shares.
For shares purchased by employees in 2004 the match was on a two for one basis and in 2005 was two and a half for one.
In addition, in 2005 there was a further one for one match if certain profit targets are achieved.
All shares under the scheme are purchased in the open market.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price nil, volatility, where applicable, 37%, expected dividend yield 4.9% to 5.4%, risk-free interest rate, where applicable, 4.94% and a term of 3 years.
e Profit Growth Incentive Plan PGIP Awards were made in April 2007 under the PGIP to certain senior employees excluding Directors.
Any benefit under the PGIP will be deliverable dependent upon the extent to which profit growth targets are satisfied by the Group over a 3 year performance period: the Groups reported profit for the year prior to the year of award forms the baseline for this performance measure.
The PGIP is a cash-based incentive plan, however, for certain very senior employees the benefit is deliverable in shares: the number of shares given below will be released following the performance period if the minimum targeted profit growth is achieved.
A maximum of twice the amount of shares listed below will be released on achievement of the maximum profit target, with one and a half times the number being released for interim performance.
No shares will be released and the awards will lapse if the minimum profit target is not achieved.
Release is also conditional upon the satisfaction of a personal shareholding requirement.
Any awards deliverable under the PGIP will be satisfied from GKN ordinary shares already in issue.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period commensurate with the term of the awards.
The risk-free interest rate is the rate obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
Further details of the ESOS, LTIP, BCIP and PGIP schemes are given in the remuneration report on pages 61 to 71. www.

Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charges resulting.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, the Groups total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately assessed and tested.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable segment.
In some cases, the CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation.
The allocation of goodwill by business segment is set out in note 2.
All of the recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used in the majority of impairment tests except where a longer term more detailed forecast is available and appropriate.
These forecasts are based on approved annual budgets and represent a best estimate of future performance.
Key assumptions In determining the recoverable amount of all CGUs it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions within forecast operating cash flow include the achievement of future sales prices and volumes including reference to specific customer relationships, product lines and the use of industry relevant external forecasts of global vehicle production within Driveline businesses and consideration of specific volumes on certain US military and civil programmes within Aerospace, raw material input costs, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benefits from annual productivity improvements, the impact of foreign exchange rates upon selling price and cost relationships and the levels of ongoing capital expenditure required to support forecast production.

A relative risk adjustment or beta has been applied to risk-free rates to reflect the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
Consideration is also given to both the amount and timing of estimated future tax cash flows.
Except for Drivelines operations in South America where rates ranging between 18% and 24% have been factored into impairment models, the range of pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates set out below have been used for impairment testing.
The range of rates reflects the mix of geographical territories within CGUs within the segments.
Driveline: 10% North America 15% Eastern European and certain Asia Pacific region countries Powder Metallurgy: 10%12% North America and Europe OffHighway: 10%13% North America and Europe Aerospace: 10%11% North America and Europe Long term growth rates To forecast beyond the five years covered by detailed forecasts, a long term average growth rate has been used.
In each case, this is not greater than the published Oxford Economic Forecast average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five year period in the territory or territories where the CGU is primarily based.
This results in a range of nominal growth rates from 0.7% to 7.0% with most countries between 2.0% and 4.0% in both years.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis to likely and potential changes in key assumptions has been reviewed.
At 31 December 2008, the date of the Groups annual impairment test, the estimated recoverable amount of two individual CGUs within the Groups Aerospace Propulsion Systems and Powder Metallurgy Hoeganaes businesses exceeded their carrying value by 88 million and 74 million respectively.
The table below shows the discount and long term growth rate assumptions used in the calculation of value in use and the amount by which each rate must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.

Market risk includes foreign exchange risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and commodity price risk.
The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance.
Derivative financial instruments, mainly forward foreign exchange contracts, are used to hedge risk exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board and are implemented by the central Treasury Department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The Treasury Department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risks, interest rate risk, financial credit risk and liquidity risk and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
These disclosures should be read in conjunction with the financing and risk commentary in the business review on pages 36 to 39. a Foreign exchange risk The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency.
These exposures are forecast on a monthly basis by operating companies and are reported to the central Treasury Department.
Under the Groups foreign exchange policy, such exposures are hedged on a reducing percentage basis over a number of forecast time horizons.
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
Until December 2008, the Groups policy was to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures for major currencies US dollar, euro and yen by hedging 70% to 90% of the net investment in overseas operations using forward foreign currency contracts or foreign currency borrowings.
Such hedging instruments were in place until maturity in December 2008.
The net investment hedging policy was suspended in December 2008 due to concerns about settlement values at a time of exchange rate volatility.
The main impact of foreign exchange risk on the Groups results arises from the translation into sterling of the results of operations outside of the UK.
The Groups largest exposures are the euro and the US dollar where a 1% movement in the average rate impacts trading profit of subsidiaries and joint ventures by 1.2 million and 0.8 million respectively.
Regarding financial instruments, a 1% strengthening of sterling against the currency rates indicated below would have the following impact on operating profit: Trading profit Derivative Payables and financial Intra-group receivables instruments funding m m m Euro 0.2 0.4 1.3 US dollar 0.3 8.3 1.0 The derivative sensitivity analysis has been prepared by reperforming the calculations used to determine the balance sheet values adjusted for the changes in the individual currency rates indicated with all other cross currency rates remaining constant.
The sensitivity is a fair value change relating to derivatives for which the underlying transaction has not occured at 31 December.
The Group intends to hold all such derivatives to maturity.
The analysis of other items has been prepared based on an analysis of a currency balance sheet.

The Groups policy is to optimise interest cost in reported earnings and reduce volatility in the debt related element of the Groups cost of capital.
This policy is achieved by maintaining a target range of fixed and floating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a defined time horizon.
The Groups normal policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 30% to 70% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a 12 month horizon.
This policy remains suspended following a Board decision in December 2004 after receipt of the original sale proceeds on the sale of the GKN share in AgustaWestland given the absence of floating rate bank debt.
Following repayment of the fixed interest Westland Group plc debenture in September 2008 the Group has operated close to the policy parameters.
At 31 December 2008 83% 2007 89% of the Groups gross borrowings were subject to fixed interest rates.
As at 31 December 2008 12 million 2007 147 million was in bank deposits of which 12 million 2007 145 million was on deposit with UK banks.
A 1% change in interest rates would have a 0.4 million impact on net interest.
This sensitivity flexes the interest rate of variable rate borrowings, assuming the level and currency mix at 31 December 2008 remains in place for 12 months.
c Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments.
In terms of substance, and consistent with the related balance sheet presentation, the Group considers it has two types of credit risk: operational and financial.
Operational credit risk relates to non-performance by customers in respect of trade receivables and by suppliers in respect of other receivables.
Financial credit risk relates to non-performance by banks and similar institutions in respect of cash and deposits, facilities and financial contracts, including forward foreign currency contracts.
Operational As tier-one suppliers to automotive, off-highway and aerospace original equipment manufacturers, the Group may have substantial amounts outstanding with a single customer at any one time.
The credit profiles of such original equipment manufacturers are available from credit rating agencies.
The failure of any such customer to honour its debts could materially impact the Groups results.
However, there are many advantages in these relationships.
In certain parts of the Group, mainly Industrial Distribution Services within Driveline and OffHighway there are a greater proportion of amounts receivable from small and medium sized customers.
Credit risk and customer relationships are managed at a number of levels within the Group.
At a subsidiary level documented credit control reviews are required to be held at least every month.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
At a divisional level debtor ratios, overdue accounts and overall performance are reviewed regularly.
Provisions for doubtful debts are determined at these levels based upon the customers ability to pay and other factors in the Groups relationship with the customer.
At 31 December the amount of trade receivables analysed by major segment due from the largest 5 customers as a proportion of total trade receivables is as follows: 2008 2007 % % Driveline 48 46 Powder Metallurgy 20 21 OffHighway 32 32 Aerospace 54 45 The amount of trade receivables outstanding at the year end does not represent the maximum exposure to operational credit risk due to the normal patterns of supply and payment over the course of a year.
Based on management information collected as at month ends the maximum level of trade receivables at any one point during the year was 714 million 2007 650 million.
Financial Credit risk is mitigated by the Groups policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment graded long term credit rating, normally at least AAor equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 12 million 2007 25 million, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for forward foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2008 to a single bank was nil 2007 3 million.
The amounts on deposit at year end represent the Groups maximum exposure to financial credit risk with Group indebtedness varying over the course of a year in line with normal financing and trading patterns.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce borrowings.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of Gross borrowings to EBITDA.
The Group seeks to operate at an EBITDA of subsidiaries to Gross debt ratio of 2.5 times or less and the ratios at 31 December 2008 and 2007 were as follows: 2008 2007 m m Gross borrowings 822 788 EBITDA 377 428 Gross borrowings to EBITDA ratio 2.2 times 1.8 times The Groups only external banking covenant requires an EBITDA of subsidiaries to net interest payable and receivable ratio of 3.5 times or more.
The ratios at 31 December 2008 were as follows: 2008 2007 m m EBITDA 377 428 Net interest payable and receivable 47 43 EBITDA to net interest payable and receivable ratio 8.0 times 10.0 times e Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk as part of its normal financing and trading cycle at times when peak borrowings are required.
Borrowings normally peak in May and September following dividend and bond coupon payments.
The Groups policies are to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet obligations when they fall due and to maintain sufficient flexibility in order to fund investment and acquisition objectives.
Liquidity needs are assessed through short and long term forecasts.
Committed bank facilities of 350 million expire in July 2010 and on which there were drawings at the year end of 34 million 2007 350 million expiring in July 2010 and undrawn at the year end.
A further 9 million of the facility had been utilised for Letters of Credit on Group borrowings in China.
Additional committed facilities were agreed in the year amounting to 55 million, maturing in 2013 and 50 million maturing in 2011.
Committed facilities are provided through 12 banks.

The Group seeks to mitigate this exposure in a variety of ways including medium term price agreements, surcharges and advance purchasing.
In rare circumstances and only in respect of certain specified risks, the Group uses derivative commodity hedging instruments.
The impact of such financial instruments in respect of the overall commodity price risk is not material.

Hedge accounting Cash flow hedges The Group manages exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on outstanding purchase and sale agreements using forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has adopted transactional foreign exchange hedge accounting in a limited number of contracts.
The value of forward foreign exchange contracts subject to hedge accounting was 8 million liability 2007 1 million asset.
The net cash flows and profit impact will occur during 2009 to 2012 2007 during 2008.
A 7 million loss was recognised in equity during the year 2007 1 million gain in respect of contracts outstanding at 31 December.
An accumulated gain of 1 million was removed from equity during the year and included in the income statement as a 1 million gain in cost of sales.
Cash flow hedging was 100% effective during 2008 and 2007.
Net investment hedging See note 19.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, net investment hedging was 100% effective during 2008 and 2007.

Amounts are only set aside when irrevocable commitments exist at the balance sheet date and these invariably reflect actual or constructive contractual arrangements which indicate the amount and most likely timing of flows.
Cash outflows that are expected to arise beyond 12 months in part relate to lease contracts where the average remaining maturity is 5 years from 31 December as well as phased retirement scheme payments in European Driveline and OffHighway businesses which have between 3 and 5 years to run.
Warranty Provisions set aside for warranty exposures either relate to amounts provided systematically based on historical experience under contractual warranty obligations attaching to the supply of goods or specific provisions created in respect of individual customer issues undergoing commercial resolution and negotiation.
In the event of a claim, settlement will be negotiated with the customer based on supply of replacement products and compensation for the customers associated costs.
Amounts set aside represent managements best estimate of the likely settlement and the timing of any resolution with the relevant customer.
Legal and environmental Legal provisions amounting to 9 million 2007 5 million relate to management estimates of amounts required to settle or remove litigation actions that have arisen in the normal course of business.
Further details are not provided to avoid the potential of seriously prejudicing the Groups stance in law.
Amounts unused and reversed only arise when the matter is formally settled or when a material change in the litigation action occurs where legal advice confirms lower amounts need to be retained to cover the exposure.
As a consequence of primarily legacy activities a small number of sites in the Group are subject to environmental remediation actions, which in all cases are either agreed formally with relevant local and national authorities and agencies or represent managements view of the likely outcome having taken appropriate expert advice and following consultation with appropriate authorities and agencies.
Amounts charged and carried reflect the current best estimates of the likely cost of remediation and inherent timings.

Finalisation of fair value adjustments in respect of the 2007 acquisition of Teleflex Aerospace Manufacturing Group of Teleflex Inc on 29 June 2007 were finalised in the first half of 2008.
There have been no amendments to the provisional fair values disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Post balance sheet acquisition On 5 January 2009, the Group acquired the wing component and sub-assembly operation of Airbus UK which is located on the Airbus Filton site in the UK.
The acquisition of the Filton facility delivers considerable benefits as the Group becomes a leading global player in critical wing structures and composites and establishes a strategic supplier relationship with Airbus.
The contractual consideration of 176 million after allowing for pension funding and other employee related matters will result in an aggregate cash payment of up to 136 million to Airbus.
This amount comprises an initial cash payment of 96 million paid on completion with a subsequent amount payable following finalisation of acquisition date inventory adjustments and 36 million payable in annual instalments over the six years 20102015 contingent on revenue metrics.
Professional fees and other costs directly attributed to the acquisition are expected to amount to 6 million.
The cash spend in 2008 on this acquisition was 1 million.
The fair value exercise is at an early stage and due to its proximity to the year end it is impracticable to determine appropriate fair values.
Provisional book and fair values will be disclosed in the Groups 2009 Half Year Report.
Initial unaudited book values at the date of acquisition recorded in 2009 management accounts reflect fixed assets of 48 million and inventory of 41 million.
As previously included in announcements to the Stock Exchange it is expected that the Filton operation will generate sales in 2009 of approximately 375 million and will be earnings accretive and cash generative.
2009 trading margin is estimated at 6% before the impact of fair value adjustments, particularly to inventory and property, plant and equipment, which will be determined during the fair value exercise.
On completion of the acquisition the Group secured additional borrowing facilities amounting to 180 million.

In the USA and the Rest of the World there are a number of externally funded defined benefit schemes while in certain companies in Europe funds are retained within the business to provide for post-employment obligations.
a Defined benefit schemes measurement and assumptions Independent actuarial valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2008.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Key assumptions were: UK Americas Europe ROW % % % % 2008 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.9 3.5 2.50 3.5 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 2.0 1.75 n a Discount rate 6.5 5.8 6.00 2.0 Inflation assumption 2.9 2.5 1.75 1.0 Rate of increases in medical costs: initial long term 6.6 4.5 9.0 5.0 n a n a 2007 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.3 3.5 2.50 2.0 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.4 2.0 1.75 n a Discount rate 5.9 6.4 5.60 2.3 Inflation assumption 3.3 2.5 1.75 1.0 Rate of increases in medical costs: initial long term 8.0 4.5 9.0 5.0 n a n a Discount rates in the table above for the UK and Europe were referenced against specific iBoxx indices, whilst the Citigroup liability index was the reference point for the USA discount rate.
The reference for the UK discount rate was the yield as at 31 December on the iBoxx Corporate rated AA bonds with a maturity of 15 years plus, which was 6.7%.
Allowing for movements in the rate immediately after the end of the year a discount rate of 6.5% was selected.
The equivalent reference rate for Europe is the iBoxx Corporate rated AA bonds with a maturity of 10 years plus.

The key current year mortality assumptions for the scheme use PA92 Year of Birth tables with a plus 2.5 year age adjustment to reflect actual mortality experience for the scheme together with medium cohort projected improvement in longevity.
Using these assumptions a male aged 65 lives for a further 19.8 years, whilst a male aged 40 is expected to live a further 21 years after retiring at 65.
The prior period valuations used the same mortality assumptions.
Overseas In the USA, CL2007 tables which were first adopted in 2007 have been used whilst in Germany the RT2005-G tables have again been used.
In the USA the longevity assumption for a male aged 65 is that he lives a further 18.8 years whilst in Germany for a further 17.7 years.
The longevity assumption for a USA male currently aged 40 is that he also lives for a further 18.8 years once attaining 65 years, with the German equivalent assumption being 17.7 years.
These assumptions are based solely on the prescribed tables not on actual GKN experience.

The 2007 past service credit of 7 million included a 12 million credit from the impact of changes to retiree medical benefits in the USA, partly offset by a past service charge of 5 million, 4 million of which is within Restructuring and impairment charges primarily from further downsizing of a UK business in the Automotive portfolio.
The 2008 settlement curtailment credit arises from changes to freeze pension benefit entitlements in Driveline and Powder Metallurgy businesses in the USA.
The 2007 settlement curtailments credit arises from changes in pension regulations in Italy.
