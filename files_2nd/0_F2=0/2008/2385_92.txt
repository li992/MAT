The provision for the costs of decommissioning these production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices or long-term assumptions, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using a real discount rate of 2.0% 2007 2.0%.
These costs are generally expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
While the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of incurring these costs.
Where BP has entered into a contract for the execution of decommissioning activity, these amounts are generally reported within accruals or other payables.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Generally, this coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.
The provision for environmental liabilities has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 2.0% 2007 2.0%.
The majority of these costs are expected to be incurred over the next 10 years.
The extent and cost of future remediation programmes are inherently difficult to estimate.
They depend on the scale of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the groups share of the liability.
Included within the litigation and other category at 31 December 2008 are provisions for litigation of $1,446 million 2007 $1,737 million, for deferred employee compensation of $792 million 2007 $761 million and for expected rental shortfalls on surplus properties of $251 million 2007 $320 million.
To the extent that these liabilities are not expected to be settled within the next three years, the provisions are discounted using either a nominal discount rate of 2.5% 2007 4.5% or a real discount rate of 2.0% 2007 2.0%, as appropriate.
No additional provisions were made during 2008 in respect of the Texas City incident in 2007 the provision was increased by $500 million.
Disbursements to claimants in 2008 were $410 million 2007 $314 million and the provision at 31 December 2008 was $46 million 2007 $456 million.
