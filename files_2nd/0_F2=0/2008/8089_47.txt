Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2008 26 Financial Instruments continued d Interest rate risk The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets and is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite: ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group policy is to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by using interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge up to 90% of forecast interest payments over a period of up to five years, based on forecast net debt levels by currency during that period.
This policy provides a level of certainty of future interest costs by swapping floating to fixed interest payments which in turn assists the predictability of achieving interest-based loan covenants.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section of this note.
Interest rate swap contracts The Group draws down on its borrowing facilities at floating rates of interest.
A portion of those are then swapped to fixed rates in line with the Group treasury policy in order to manage its cash flow interest rate risk.
Such contracts enable the Group to convert borrowings from floating rates and swap them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at fixed rates directly.
Under interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals primarily quarterly, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balance at the end of the financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Cash flow hedges Outstanding receive floating, Average contracted Notional principal pay fixed contracts fixed interest rate amount Fair Value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % 000 000 000 000 Within one year 4.97 4.29 313,209 99,703 4,691 790 Within one to two years 4.73 4.93 202,373 321,776 8,638 4,598 Within two to five years 4.64 4.76 495,855 513,729 32,743 6,554 1,011,437 935,208 46,072 10,362 At 31 December 2008, the fixed interest rates vary from 4.01% to 6.23% 2007: 3.50% to 6.23%, and the main floating rates are EURIBOR and LIBOR.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity Note 28 on interest rate swap contracts as of 31 December 2008 will be released to the Income Statement when the related bank borrowings are repaid Note 25.
72 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2008 26 Financial Instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not designate derivates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model.
Due to the high percentage of loans that are designated in hedging relationships, the Groups interest rate sensitivity would only be over the exposure to variable rate debt.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year would decrease or increase by 3,441,000 2007: 3,336,000. e Foreign currency risk The Group is a business with significant net US Dollar USD and net Euro EUR transactions, hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Without action in conversion of USD and other trading currencies, such as the EUR, cash positions in these currencies would develop imbalances by growing GBP debt.
Allied to the Groups policy on the hedging of surplus foreign currency cash inflows, the Group will usually seek to finance its net investment in its principal overseas subsidiaries by borrowing in those subsidiaries functional currencies, primarily EUR and USD.
This policy has the effect of protecting the Groups Consolidated Balance Sheet from movements in those currencies to the extent that the associated net assets are hedged by the net foreign currency borrowings.
The following significant exchange rates versus GBP applied during the year: Reporting date Average rate mid-spot rate 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % % % USD 1.8637 2.0039 1.4602 2.0044 EUR 1.2627 1.4616 1.0465 1.3624 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 73 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2008 26 Financial Instruments continued Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group receives approximately 50% of its revenues and incurs approximately 40% of its costs in USD.
The Group is therefore sensitive to movements in the USD against the GBP.
Each 1 cent movement in the USD to GBP exchange rate has a circa 3 million impact on revenue and a circa 1 million impact on operating profits.
Offsetting this will be reductions to USD interest and US tax liabilities.
This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
The Group receives approximately 15% of its revenues and incurs approximately 15% of its costs in Euros.
The Group is therefore sensitive to movements in the Euro against the GBP.
Each 1 cent movement in the Euro to GBP exchange rate has a circa 1 million impact on revenue and a circa 0.3 million impact on operating profit.
Offsetting this will be reductions to Euro interest and Euro tax liabilities.
f Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and available for sale investments, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies such as Standard and Poors, Moodys and Fitch.
No credit exposure on derivative financial instruments is permitted to a financial institution with a rating lower then A or equivalent.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Treasury Committee at least annually.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Trade receivables Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas and the Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
Concentration of credit risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows where material discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined by references to past default experience and historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit rating system to assess the potential customers credit quality.
All customers have credit limits set by credit managers and are subject to standard terms of payment for each division.
As the events division works on a prepaid basis they are not subject to the same credit controls and they have a very low bad debt history.
74 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2008 26 Financial Instruments continued The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables, which are non-interest bearing, approximates their fair value.
Included in the Groups trade receivables are debtors with a carrying amount of 9,421,000 2007: 13,537,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided, as there has not been a significant change in the credit quality and the amounts are considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
Movement in the provision for impairment: 2008 2007 000 000 Balance at beginning of the year 13,844 13,194 Impairment provision recognised 10,948 3,770 Receivables written off as uncollectible 1,943 1,501 Amounts recovered during the year 769 1,619 Total 22,080 13,844 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the above amount.
There are no customers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade receivables in both 2008 or 2007.
Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 75 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2008 26 Financial Instruments continued g Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, though operationally it is managed by Group Treasury.
They have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in Note 22 is a summary of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Historically and for the foreseeable future the Group has been and is expected to continue to be in a net borrowing position.
The Groups policy is to fulfil its borrowing requirements by borrowing in the currencies in which it operates, principally GBP, USD and EUR: thereby providing a natural hedge against projected future surplus USD and EUR cash inflows as well as spreading the Groups interest rate profile across a number of currencies.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below has been drawn up based on the contractual maturities of the financial assets including interest that will be earned on those assets except where the Group anticipates that the cash flow will occur in a different period.

The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
The Group draws down on its borrowing facilities at floating rates of interest.
A portion of those are then swapped to fixed rates in line with the Group Treasury policy.
The first portion of these swaps that matures within twelve months is 313,209,000 2007: 99,703,000, the second portion that matures in a period greater than one year but less than two years is 202,373,000 2007: 321,776,000 and the final portion that matures between two and five years is 495,855,000 2007: 513,729,000.
Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 77 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2008 26 Financial Instruments continued h Fair value of financial instruments The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets is determined with reference to quoted market prices: the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments is determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments: the fair value of derivative instruments is calculated using quoted prices.
Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives: and the fair value of financial guarantee contracts is determined using option pricing models where the main assumptions are the probability of default by the specified counterparty extrapolated from market-based credit information and the amount of loss, given the default.
Except as detailed in the following table, the Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments or because they bear interest at rates approximate to the market.
