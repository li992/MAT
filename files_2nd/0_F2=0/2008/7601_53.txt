CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups capital consists of equity.
It is managed with the aim of maintaining an appropriate level of financing available for the Groups activities, having due regard to interest rate and currency risks and the availability of borrowing facilities.
The gearing ratio, which is net debt expressed as a percentage of total equity, is monitored regularly against both internal targets and external covenant requirements.
Changes in equity arise from the retention of earnings and, from time to time, rights issues of share capital.
When the Group has net debt it is monitored on a daily basis and is managed by the control of working capital, dividend and capital expenditure payments and the purchase and disposal of assets and businesses.
At the year end, the capital comprised: 2008 2007 m m Total equity 566.2 311.9 Net debt 139.2 Gross capital employed 566.2 451.1 Gearing n a 45% During the year, net debt was repaid from the proceeds on the sale of Gibson Energy completed in December.
