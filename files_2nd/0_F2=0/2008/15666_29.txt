See the section entitled Results of Operations for additional information.
Average invested capital was calculated assuming the Reuters acquisition purchase price and obligations assumed were included in the invested capital base as of the beginning of the period.
2 For 2007, we calculated ROIC based on reported results from continuing operations.
No adjustment was made to add back the results of discontinued operations given that numerous disposals occurred during the year and partial year adjustments in these circumstances distort annualized results.
In particular, our largest disposal, Thomson Learning, had a significant impact due to the fact that it was a highly seasonal business which was disposed of mid-year.
Accordingly, the 2007 ROIC calculation excludes all impacts from businesses classied as discontinued operations.
3 Remove impact of change in fair value associated with foreign currency embedded derivatives of customer contracts.
4 This adjustment reects the actual results of Thomson Learnings higher education, careers and library reference, NETg and Prometric businesses in Thomson Learning as if they had been part of continuing operations for the periods presented.
Specically, this amount reects depreciation expense which is excluded from GAAP results under the accounting requirements for discontinued operations.
Costs incurred in connection with the disposal of the businesses have been excluded.
5 For 2006 as reported amounts include discontinued operations.
6 Items excluded as not deemed components of invested capital: Other primarily consists of non-current liabilities.
7 Excludes debt swaps as balances are nancing rather than operating-related.
8 Excludes accumulated amortization as only gross identiable intangible assets and goodwill cost are considered components of invested capital.
Excludes goodwill arising from adoption of CICA 3465.
This goodwill was created via deferred tax liability instead of cash purchase price.
9 Present value of operating leases deemed component of invested capital.
10 Adds back write-downs that were not cash transactions.
