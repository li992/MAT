30 Grainger plc annual report and accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14 Taxation continued As detailed in note 30, deferred tax has been taken direct to equity in relation to the actuarial surplus on the BPT Limited pension scheme and the fair value movement in cash flow hedges and exchange adjustments.
Factors that may affect future tax charges The group has not taken all of the benefit in relation to capital losses brought forward and available for offset against subsequent capital gains arising as this has yet to be formally agreed with the relevant tax authorities.
If it is found that all the capital losses are available for offset against capital gains, then provisions of up to 16m would be released over the coming years.
15 Dividends Under IAS 10, final dividends are excluded from the balance sheet either until they are approved by the company in general meeting or when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the group.
Dividends paid in the year are shown below: 2008 2007 m m Ordinary dividends on equity shares: Final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2007 4.12p per share 5.2 Final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2006 3.75p per share 4.9 Interim dividend for the year ended 30 September 2008 2.27p per share 2.9 Interim dividend for the year ended 30 September 2007 2.06p per share 2.7 8.1 7.6 In addition to the above, a provision has been made in the accounts to 30 September 2008 of 0.2m for the payment of a dividend to the minority interest in FRM at a rate of 0.13 per share before tax.
The payment of this dividend has been authorised by the management board of FRM and was approved by the Local Court of Frankfurt on 30 September 2008.
The total dividend taken to equity in the year is therefore 8.3m 2007: 7.6m.
A final dividend relating to 2008 of 3.91p per share has been proposed by the board.
If approved, this will result in a further distribution of 5.3m and it will be paid on 16 February 2009 to shareholders on the register on 9 January 2009.
The 2008 interim dividend of 2.27p per share was paid in July 2008.
This gives a total dividend for 2008 of 6.18p per share, the same level as in 2007.
16 Loss earnings per share Basic Basic loss earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the group and held both in trust and as treasury shares to meet its obligations under the long-term incentive scheme LTIS.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding by the dilutive effect of ordinary shares that the company may potentially issue relating to its convertible bond and its share option schemes and contingent share awards under the LTIS, based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2008 was the end of the contingency period.
The loss profit for the year is adjusted to add back the after tax interest cost on the liability component of the convertible bond.
Where the effect of the above adjustments is antidilutive, as is the case in 2008, they are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss earnings per share.
