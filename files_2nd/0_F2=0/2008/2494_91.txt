These assets are expected to be sold within a period of 1 year from the balance sheet date and have been included as assets classified as held-for-sale.
The book values of the acquired assets have been revalued to fair value as at the acquisition date.
The main adjustments relate to the revaluation of land and buildings, recognition of cigarette trademarks and the related impact of deferred taxation.
In addition to the fair value adjustments above, goodwill carried in the local books has been reversed.
The goodwill of 923 million arising on the acquisition of the cigarette and snus businesses of ST represents a strategic premium to acquire cigarette market leadership in Denmark and Norway and significant cigarette market positions in Sweden and Poland, together with a stronger snus business as a result of acquiring in-house manufacturing and additional expertise, along with anticipated synergies that will arise post-acquisition.
The goodwill in respect of ST on the balance sheet comprises the 923 million as a result of this transaction, together with 64 million from earlier transactions which relates to the cigarette and snus businesses.
In the period from 2 July 2008 to 31 December 2008 the acquired businesses contributed revenue of 275 million and profit from operations of 60 million after charging 19 million for amortisation of acquired trademarks and 13 million in respect of restructuring and integration costs.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2008, before accounting for anticipated synergy and restructuring benefits, it is estimated that Group revenue would have been 12,411 million and Group profit from operations would have been 3,644 million for the year to 31 December 2008.
These amounts have been estimated based on the ST results for the 6 months prior to acquisition adjusted to reflect changes arising as a result of the acquisition fair value adjustments.
The amounts reported for profit from operations are after charging 19 million for amortisation of acquired trademarks for the period to 2 July 2008. b Tekel On 22 February 2008, the Group announced that it had won the public tender to acquire the cigarette business assets of Tekel, the Turkish state-owned tobacco company, with a bid of US$1,720 million.
The acquisition only relates to the cigarette business assets of Tekel, which principally comprise trademarks, factories and tobacco leaf stocks.
The acquisition did not include employees and the Group had directly employed the required workforce by the effective date of the transaction.
Completion of this transaction was subject to regulatory approval which was subsequently received and on 24 June 2008 the Group completed the transaction subject to finalisation of completion accounts.
The goodwill of 566 million on the cigarette business assets of Tekel, stated at the exchange rates ruling on the date of the transaction, arises as follows: Provisional values Book Fair value Fair value adjustments value m m m Intangible assets 127 127 Property, plant and equipment 77 40 37 Deferred tax assets 11 Inventories 154 24 130 Trade and other receivables 11 Other provisions for liabilities and charges 4 4 Assets classified as held-for-sale 69 15 Net assets acquired 237 70 307 Goodwill 566 Total consideration 873 Consideration comprises: Cash 866 Acquisition costs 7 Total consideration 873 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2008 158 Directors report and accounts Group financial statements go online at www.
com annualreport2008 26 Business combinations and disposals continued Included within the cigarette business assets acquired from Tekel are certain items of property, plant and equipment that are being actively marketed for sale.
These assets, amounting to 15 million, are expected to be sold within a period of 1 year from the balance sheet date and have been included as assets classified as held-for-sale.
The main adjustments relate to the downwards revaluation of land and buildings, reduction in inventory to net realisable value and the recognition of cigarette trademarks.
The goodwill of 566 million arising on the acquisition of the cigarette business assets of Tekel represents a strategic premium to acquire Tekels significant market position in the Turkish cigarette market and anticipated synergies that will arise post acquisition.
Finalisation of part of the transaction is still ongoing and, in addition, work in respect of identifying the appropriate fair value to be assigned to the acquired cigarette business assets has been ongoing since the published results for the 6 months to 30 June 2008.
This further work has led to the goodwill increasing by 90 million compared to the provisional amount included in the 6 months results.
This has arisen due to more detailed on-site inspections and a review by the external valuers in determining the most appropriate fair values for property, plant and equipment and the assets disclosed as held for sale.
In the period from 24 June 2008 to 31 December 2008 the acquired Tekel cigarette business assets contributed revenue of 135 million and a loss from operations of 16 million after charging 5 million for amortisation of acquired intangibles and 41 million in respect of restructuring and integration costs.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2008, before accounting for anticipated synergy, restructuring and pricing benefits, it is currently estimated that Group revenue would have been 12,232 million and Group profit from operations would have been 3,576 million for the year ended 31 December 2008.
These amounts have been estimated based on the Tekel results for the 6 months prior to acquisition, adjusted to reflect changes arising as a result of the acquisition fair value adjustments.
The amounts reported for profit from operations are after charging 4 million for amortisation of acquired intangibles for the period to 24 June 2008. c As described in note 3 h, the Group agreed to sell its pipe tobacco trademarks on 20 February 2007: sold its Belgian cigar factory and associated trademarks on 3 September 2007: and on 1 October 2007 agreed to terminate its Chesterfield license agreement with Philip Morris in a number of countries in Southern Africa.
d At 31 December 2008, held-for-sale assets reflect the ST trademarks of 182 million which the Group is required to divest as a condition for regulatory approval of the acquisition of the cigarette and snus businesses of ST, 16 million of property, plant and equipment acquired from Tekel being actively marketed for sale and 18 million of property, plant and equipment in Bologna, Italy which is expected to be sold in 2009.
The remainder comprises non-core assets in various locations being actively marketed for sale comprising plant, property and equipment of 9 million 2007: 30 million, inventories of nil 2007: 3 million and other assets of nil 2007: 3 million.
These assets are expected to be sold in 2009.
In 2007, trade and other payables of 2 million have been shown as liabilities directly associated with assets held-for-sale.
