Share-based payments Equity-settled share option plan The Company has a number of share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the Companys Ordinary Shares have been granted to certain Directors and management, details of which are given in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 24.
Options were granted at the five-day average of the market value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
The options can normally only be exercised after three years and are subject to the achievement of earnings per share targets imposed at the date of grant.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the option vests or before vested options are exercised.
The charge for share options in respect of employee services during the period ended 26 April 2008 was nil 2007: credit of 1.0m.
A credit arose in the prior period as performance conditions for awards vesting had not been met and management revised their estimate of the achievability of performance conditions relating to awards vesting in future periods.
The movements in the number of share options during the year are detailed in the table below.
The options outstanding at 26 April 2008 had a weighted average exercise price of 203p 2007: 198p and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.7 years 2007: 6.7 years.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 122p 2007: 153p.

However, as the minimum performance conditions have not been met, these options will lapse in the 2008 09 financial year.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using the Black Scholes model.
There were no grants of share options during the period under review.
The inputs into the Black Scholes model in the year ended 28 April 2007 were as follows: Group and Company 2007 5.0 Dividend yield % 25.0 Expected volatility % 5.4 Expected life years 4.5 Risk-free interest rate % 154 Weighted average share price p 154 Weighted average exercise price p 26 Weighted average fair value p The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.

Share-based payments continued Equity-settled deferred annual bonus As part of the HMV Group plc Incentive Plan for Senior Executives HIPS, as discussed more fully in the Directors remuneration report on page 23, the Company makes deferred awards to certain Directors and senior management.
These awards are made in shares and the number of shares awarded is determined by reference to the market value of shares at the time the award is made, not when it is paid.
No adjustment to value is made for expected dividend income during the vesting period.
The deferred award normally vests following the third anniversary of the end of the financial year in which the award is made, subject to the achievement of certain profit related targets and the performance of the individual over the vesting period.
The charge in respect of deferred awards during the period ended 26 April 2008 was 0.2m 2007: 0.1m.

Under the SIP, employees may acquire Ordinary Shares in three ways.
Firstly, the Company can use the SIP as part of its broad incentive arrangements by awarding free shares to employees: in this regard an award of 120 free shares was made to every eligible employee on the Initial Public Offering in May 2002.
There have not been any further awards of free shares and there are no plans to award further free shares to any employees.
Secondly, the Company may invite UK employees to purchase Ordinary Shares, known as partnership shares, and thirdly, the Company may, if it wishes, agree to match the shares purchased with additional shares, known as Matching Shares.
The Company has matched on a one for one basis since the inception of the SIP.
The charge in respect of the SIP during the year ended 26 April 2008 was 0.4m 2007: 0.6m.
