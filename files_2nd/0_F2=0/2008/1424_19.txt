Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share at 13 September 2008 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders of 357m 2007 369m, and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 790 million 2007 790 million.
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Option Scheme on which the dividends are being waived.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of profits less losses on the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses, amortisation of non-operating intangibles, exceptional items and the associated tax credits, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share options.
The diluted, weighted average number of shares is 790 million 2007 790 million.
There is no difference between basic and diluted earnings.

Intangible assets continued Impairment Goodwill As at 13 September 2008, the consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 1,220m.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units, or groups of cashgenerating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill, as follows: 2008 2007 cash-generating unit cgu or group of cgus Primary reporting segment m m ACH Grocery 225 200 AB Mauri Ingredients 297 222 Twinings Ovaltine Grocery 119 119 Capullo Grocery 58 58 Illovo Sugar 143 143 Pataks Grocery 58 58 Northern China Sugar Sugar 56 Other Various 264 223 1,220 1,023 The amount of goodwill allocated to each CGU or group of CGUs is not individually significant.
A CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
There have been no indications of impairment relating to the CGUs or groups of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated and, accordingly, the disclosures that follow relate to the impairment test that is required to be conducted on an annual basis: The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs based on the most recent budget.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the budget are based on a range of growth rates that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections for the most recent budget are based relate to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using a range of rates based on the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The rates used vary between 8% and 11%.
The growth rates applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that is significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill were in a range between 0% and 2.5%.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.

The charge for the year is based on recommendations by qualified actuaries.
Unfunded post-retirement medical benefit schemes are accounted for as for defined benefit pension schemes.
Assumptions The financial assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes under IAS 19, together with the expected long-term rates of return on assets, are: 2008 2007 2006 % % % Discount rate 6.00 5.80 5.10 Inflation 3.70 3.30 3.00 Rate of increase in salaries 5.20 4.80 4.50 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.50 3.10 2.80 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 3.70 3.30 3.00 The mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the PA92 generational mortality tables with medium cohort improvements, as published by the Institute of Actuaries.
These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in life expectancy of scheme members.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2008 2007 and 2006 life expectancy from age 65 in years Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2008 20.7 22.6 19.3 22.1 Member aged 65 in 2028 22.5 24.1 20.3 23.0 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.

The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rate of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and with a similar maturity to the scheme liabilities, and applies to these rates suitable risk premia that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.
The UK schemes net pension asset of 85m 2007 284m less the overseas schemes net pension liability of 24m 2007 8m totals 61m 2007 276m.
This equates to the employee benefits asset of 106m 2007 308m and liability of 45m 2007 31m shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheet, together with no employee benefits liability 2007 1m included within liabilities classified as held for sale.

The recoverability of deferred tax assets is supported by the expected level of future profits in the countries concerned.
Other deferred tax assets totalling 6m 2007 3m have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
In addition, there are temporary differences of 1,460m 2007 1,024m relating to investments in subsidiaries.
No deferred tax has been provided in respect of these differences, since the timing of the reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the future.

Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale As at 13 September 2008, 11m of goodwill and 8m of property, plant & equipment was classified as held for sale.
The goodwill is included within the Grocery and the Americas segments.
The property, plant & equipment is included within the Sugar and Europe, Middle East and Africa segments.
The proceeds of disposal are expected to exceed the carrying value of the assets to be disposed, and accordingly no impairment losses were recognised upon classification as held for sale.
In the prior year, the primary disposal group was the existing German yeast business shown in the Ingredients and Europe, Middle East & Africa segments, disposal of which was completed on 31 March 2008.
The disposal group comprised assets of 42m and liabilities of 7m.
The remaining 6m of assets classified as held for sale were mainly items of property, plant & equipment within the Grocery, Sugar, Ingredients and Agriculture business segments, and the United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East & Africa and the Americas geographic segments.

The amount payable by the Company on redemption is the amount paid up on the deferred shares.
Redemption is at the sole discretion of the Company.
Deferred shares carry no voting rights and have no rights to dividends or other income distributions.
In the event of a winding-up, repayment in respect of the deferred shares ranks after repayment of amounts paid up on the ordinary shares of the Company.
The deferred shares are entitled to repayment of amounts paid up, but have no entitlement to any surplus.
Other reserves The other reserves arose from the cancellation of 173m of share premium account by the Company in 1993 and is non-distributable.
Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the groups net investment in foreign subsidiaries.

Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions During the year, the group completed the merger of Ryvita and Jordans and the acquisition of certain of the European assets of Gilde Bakery Ingredients, 11 beet sugar factories in north east China and the KR Castlemaine meat and smallgoods business in Australia.
The group also completed a number of other small acquisitions.
Costs associated with these acquisitions are included within cash consideration.
The acquisitions had the following effect on the groups assets and liabilities: 2008 Pre-acquisition Recognised carrying values on amounts acquisition Note m m net assets Intangible assets 8 20 101 Property, plant & equipment 9 142 108 Inventories 54 56 Trade and other receivables 40 40 Cash and cash equivalents 4 4 Trade and other payables 49 49 Overdrafts 1 1 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 32 32 Taxation 1 21 Employee benefits 12 2 2 Provisions 2 2 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 173 202 Goodwill on acquisitions 8 128 Minority interests acquired 5 Total consideration 325 satisfied by Cash consideration 189 Deferred consideration 97 Interests in subsidiaries 24 Interest in associate 15 net cash Cash consideration 189 Cash overdraft acquired 3 Cash consideration in respect of prior year acquisitions 6 192 There were no material differences between pre-acquisition carrying amounts and amounts recognised on acquisition, which include fair value adjustments to the assets and liabilities acquired, with the exception of 81m of intangibles recognised, a 34m downward adjustment to property, plant & equipment, a 20m adjustment to deferred tax and a 2m revaluation of inventories.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability from the sale of the groups existing products in new markets, and the anticipated future technological and operational synergies from the combinations.
The acquisitions in aggregate contributed revenue of 221m and profit before tax of nil for the periods between the dates of acquisition and 13 September 2008.
Aggregate contributions to revenue and profit before tax had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the period have not been disclosed, as appropriately consolidated financial information prepared under Adopted IFRS is not available.

Acquisitions and disposals continued Acquisition of W. Jordan & Son Silo Limited Jordans The merger of Ryvita and Jordans was completed on 29 August 2008.
The acquired company contributed no net profit to the consolidated net profit for the year.
The contribution to consolidated revenues and net profit had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the year has not been disclosed, as it would be impractical to determine these amounts.
This is because i as a privately-held group, Jordans prepared its consolidated financial statements under United Kingdom accounting standards, which are substantively different to Adopted IFRS: ii Jordans had a different year end to the group 29 February : and iii the last available consolidated financial statements are for the year ended 29 February 2008, all of which is insufficient to determine accurately the fair value adjustments that would have been made to the balance sheet one year ago.
A summary of Jordans reported results for its most recent full year are shown below: income statement for the year ended 29 february 2008 m Revenue 86 Cost of sales 60 Gross profit 26 Distribution expenses 14 Administrative expenses 5 Operating profit 7 Interest payable Profit before taxation 7 Taxation 2 Profit after taxation 5 2007 During 2007 the group purchased Pataks, completed a number of small acquisitions and disposed of its interests in a number of small businesses.

Share-based payments The group had the following equity-settled share-based payment plans in operation during the period: Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme the 1994 Scheme This scheme was established by the Company in 1994.
Under the terms of the 1994 Scheme, options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company were granted to selected qualifying employees over the ten years from November 1994.
The options must be held for five years before they become exercisable.
The exercise of options is not subject to specified performance criteria.
Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2000 Scheme This scheme was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 15 December 2000.
Under the terms of the 2000 Scheme, options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company may be granted to selected employees over the ten years from 15 December 2000.
The options must be held for three years before they become exercisable.
The exercise of an option under this scheme will, in accordance with institutional shareholder guidelines, be conditional on the achievement of performance criteria which are based on growth in the groups profits.
Associated British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 the Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 5 December 2003.
It takes the form of conditional allocations of shares which will be released if, and to the extent that, certain performance targets are satisfied over a three-year performance period.
Further information regarding the operation of the above plans can be found on pages 30 to 32 of the Remuneration report.

Ordinary shares already issued and subject to option under the 1994 Scheme and the 2000 Scheme, or subject to allocation under the Share Incentive Plan, are held in a separate trust.
The trust is funded by the Company.
At 13 September 2008 the trust held 2,102,133 2007 1,929,243 ordinary shares of the Company.
Fair values The weighted average fair values for the 1994 Scheme and the 2000 Scheme were determined using a binomial lattice model for share options or by taking the market price of the shares at the time of grant and discounting for the fact that dividends are not paid during the vesting period for conditional allocations of shares.
The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded under the Share Incentive Plan during the year was 837 pence 2007 825 pence and the weighted average share price was 900 pence 2007 887 pence.
The dividend yield used was 2.5%.
No options were granted under the 1994 Scheme or the 2000 Scheme in either 2007 or 2008.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, the group has recognised an expense in respect of all grants under these plans made after 7 November 2002 and unvested at 18 September 2004.
The group recognised a total equity-settled share-based payment expense of 5m 2007 6m.

Other financial liabilities comprise derivative liabilities shown above.
84 Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial statements 25.
Financial instruments continued The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: 1.
Cash and cash equivalents have been stated at their book values due to their short maturities or otherwise immediate or short-term access and realisability.
Other non-current investments recorded within other non-current receivables comprise minority shareholdings held primarily in privately owned, unquoted companies, where there is no active market available to value them.
Where the fair value of the equity instruments cannot be reliably measured, they are recorded at cost.
Where shareholdings are held in publicly quoted companies, bid price is used to estimate fair value.
The fair values of finance lease receivables and other long-term receivables have been estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
The fair values of trade receivables, other receivables and accrued income have been stated at their book values due to their short maturities.
Other current investments primarily comprise debt securities and time deposits, which are stated at fair value, based on cost for instruments similar in nature to cash and cash equivalents or on current market prices.
The fair value of derivatives is determined either by reference to third party valuations usually from a bank, or by reference to readily observable market prices.
The groups derivatives primarily cover a period of no more than 12 months from the balance sheet date, and information derived from an active market is therefore almost always available to assist with the valuation of derivatives.
The fair values of trade payables, other payables and accruals have been stated at their book values due to their short maturities.
The fair values of all bank loans, overdrafts and debenture stock have been calculated using the present value of estimated future cash flows.
The fair values of finance lease creditors have been estimated by discounting expected cash flows.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Consequently, the fair value has been presented as book value.
b Derivative financial instruments The carrying amount of derivative financial instruments at the reporting date set out below is classified as current on the face of the balance sheet.
An analysis of derivatives that are designated in a formal hedging relationship, and those that are not, is shown above.

The groups financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business.
Risk management policies and systems have been established and are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the groups activities.
The group, through its standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The group sources and sells products and manufactures goods in a wide variety of locations around the world.
These operations expose the group to potentially significant price volatility in the financial and commodity markets.
Trading and risk management teams have been established in the groups major businesses to manage this exposure by entering into a range of products, including physical and financial forward contracts, futures, and, where appropriate, options.
These teams work closely with group Treasury and report regularly to executive management.
Treasury operations and commodity procurement are conducted within a clearly defined framework of board-approved policies and guidelines to manage the groups financial and commodity risks.
Treasury works closely with the groups procurement teams to manage commodity risks.
Treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to the group at all times, for the management and development of the groups businesses, whilst effectively managing its market risk and credit risk.
The groups risk management policy explicitly forbids the use of financial or commodity derivatives outside its risk management framework of mitigating financial and commodity risks for speculative purposes.
86 Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial statements 25.
Financial instruments continued e Foreign currency translation The group presents its financial statements in sterling.
As a result of its diverse worldwide operations, the group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk where overseas operations have a functional currency other than sterling.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation into sterling of both the income statement and net assets of these foreign operations.
Where appropriate, the group finances its operations by borrowing locally in the functional currency of its operations.
This reduces net asset values reported in functional currencies other than sterling, thereby reducing the economic exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on translation.
The group also finances its operations by obtaining funding at group level through external borrowings, and where they are not in sterling, these borrowings are designated as net investment hedges.
This enables gains and losses arising on retranslation of these foreign currency borrowings to be charged to equity, providing a partial offset in equity against the gains and losses arising on translation of the net assets of foreign operations.
The group does not actively hedge the translation impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the income statement other than via the partial economic hedge arising from the servicing costs on non-sterling borrowings, nor does it use derivatives to hedge its net investments in foreign operations.
The group also designates certain of its intercompany loan arrangements as quasi-equity for the purposes of IAS 21.
The effect of the designation is that any foreign exchange volatility arising within the borrowing entity and or the lending entity is accounted for directly within equity.
The group has foreign currency borrowings that have been designated as hedges of its net investment in foreign operations in Euros and US dollars.
The value of these financial liabilities used as hedging instruments at the balance sheet date was: 2008 2007 m m Euro 285 248 US dollar 190 167 475 415 The foreign exchange loss of 58m 2007 4m gain on retranslation of these loans has been taken to the translation reserve on consolidation.
f Market risk Market risk is the risk of movements in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or forecast transaction as underlying market prices change.
The group is exposed to changes in the market price of commodities, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
These risks are known as transaction or recognised exposures and economic or forecast exposures.
i Commodity price risk Commodity price risk arises from the procurement of raw materials and the consequent exposure to changes in market prices.
The group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business.
Exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities including wheat, edible oils, soya beans, meat and dairy, sugar raws, cocoa, rice, tea and energy is managed through the use of forward physical contracts and hedging instruments, including futures and options contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices.
The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the groups risk management policies and is continually monitored by group treasury.
Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the groups overall pricing strategy.
Some of the groups commodity derivatives are treated as own use contracts, which are outside the scope of IAS 39, since they are both entered into, and continue to be held, for the purposes of the groups ordinary operations, and are not net settled the group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Own use contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises.
Certain other commodity derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the forecast transaction is highly probable and the hedge is assessed as effective.
The group obtains hedge accounting for the majority of these contracts.
Some commodity derivatives are not eligible for treatment as own use contracts and are not contracts for which the strict requirements of hedge accounting under IAS 39 are able to be satisfied.
This occurs typically where the group does not take physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
While such commodity derivatives are used only where the business believes they provide an economic hedge of an underlying exposure, formal hedge accounting may not be possible for reasons including: where the derivatives are in respect of a similar but different commodity to that being hedged: where exchange-traded derivatives are used that are not sufficiently close in all respects for example quality attributes to the business requirement: or where the exchange used is foreign to the business.
Where hedge accounting for commodity derivatives within the scope of IAS 39 is not available, the instruments are classified as held for trading and are marked to market through the income statement.
The majority of the groups forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2008 87 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued for the year ended 13 September 2008 25.
Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the groups results and the groups equity of changes in commodity market prices as a result of entering into financial instruments including derivatives.
The only financial assets and liabilities expected to show any sensitivity in this respect are commodity derivatives.
The sensitivity chosen is a 20% increase in the forward curves for various commodity prices as if they had occurred on 13 September 2008.
For as long as the group continues to make limited use of options, a 20% decrease in forward prices would produce a broadly equal and opposite impact on profit and equity to that shown.
The movement of forward price curves by 20% is considered to be a reasonable approximation of how much markets might typically move, on average, over any given year, notwithstanding that the increases in some commodity prices during the past year have been significantly greater than this.
The sensitivity analysis addresses the impact on year end financial assets and liabilities, and is not an estimate of what profit might have been if commodity prices had been uniformly different throughout the year.
The following assumptions have been applied in the calculation of these sensitivities, which are presented before taxation and minority interests: all qualifying cash flow hedges at 13 September 2008 will continue to be fully effective in achieving cash flow hedge accounting: and commodity contracts that qualify for the own use treatment continue to do so.
This sensitivity therefore has no impact for these contracts.

Changes in floating interest rates therefore affect the fair value of these fixed rate financial instruments: and interest cash flow risk results from financial instruments bearing floating rates.
Changes in floating interest rates affect cash flows on interest receivable or payable.
The groups policy is to maintain floating rate debt for the majority of its bank finance, although it periodically assesses its position with respect to interest price and cash flow risk and interest rate swaps are sometimes entered into in more volatile markets.
At 13 September 2008, 222m 19% 2007 181m and 25% of total debt was subject to fixed rates of interest.
A majority of the groups fixed rate debt is 3 accounted for by the 150m 10 4% secured redeemable debenture stock 2013.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance, for various time periods up to 12 months, by reference to official market rates eg LIBOR.
Sensitivity analysis Applying a 100 basis point parallel increase in the interest rate yield curve as if it had occurred on 13 September 2008 results in no impact on profit for the year or total equity 2007 no impact on profit or total equity.
The following assumptions have been applied in the calculation of this sensitivity, which is presented before taxation and minority interests: the impact of this sensitivity has only been recorded for changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which have their fair value gains and losses recorded within the financial statements, assets available for sale, and other current investments, as the group does not designate any other financial asset at fair value through profit or loss and these are the only significant financial instruments whose carrying amounts change as a result of changes in interest rates.
All other financial instruments are carried at amortised cost: no impact is recorded in respect of changes in interest rates on employee benefits including pensions, or discount rates applied to financial instruments to record them at present value: and all qualifying cash flow hedges at 13 September 2008 will continue to be fully effective in achieving cash flow hedge accounting.
88 Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial statements 25.
Financial instruments continued A second sensitivity analysis calculates the impact on profitability of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on floating rate interest-bearing loans and overdrafts, and on cash and cash equivalents balances on which variable rates of interest are earned.
The year end cash balance is deducted from the year end floating rate loans and overdrafts balance.
This net floating rate borrowing figure is multiplied by 1%.
In 2008, this equated to an interest expense of 6m before taxation and minority interests 2007 1m.
iii Foreign currency risk The group conducts business worldwide and consequently in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates which affect the groups transaction costs.
The group also publishes its financial statements in sterling and is therefore exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations into sterling.
Translation risk is discussed in section e above.
Transaction risk Currency transaction exposure occurs where a business makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
It also arises where monetary assets and liabilities of a business are not denominated in its functional currency, and where dividends or surplus funds are remitted from overseas.
The groups policy is to match transaction exposures wherever possible, and to hedge actual exposures and firm commitments as soon as they occur by using forward foreign currency contracts.
All foreign currency instruments contracted with non-group entities to manage transaction exposures are undertaken by group treasury or, where foreign currency controls restrict group treasury acting on behalf of subsidiaries, under the guidance of group treasury.
Identification of transaction exposures is the responsibility of each business.
The group uses derivatives principally forward foreign currency contracts and time options to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
The group does not seek formal fair value hedge accounting for such transaction hedges.
Instead, such derivatives are classified as held for trading and marked to market through the income statement.
This offsets the income statement impact of the retranslation of the foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
Economic forecast risk The group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases on a rolling 12 month basis.
The group does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The majority of the groups currency derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The groups most significant currency transaction exposures are: sugar prices in British Sugar UK and Poland to movements in the sterling euro and Polish zloty euro exchange rates respectively: sugar prices in Illovo to movements in the South African rand US dollar euro exchange rates: and sourcing for Primark costs are denominated in a number of currencies, predominantly sterling, euros and US dollars.
Elsewhere, a number of businesses make sales and purchase a variety of raw materials in foreign currencies primarily US dollars and euros, giving rise to transaction exposures.
In all other material respects, businesses tend to operate in their functional currencies and, as a result, further transaction exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements is modest.
The EU sugar restructuring scheme has modified the way in which the price of sugar beet is set in sterling for the UK and in Polish zlotys for Poland, resulting in changes to the net euro currency exposure of British Sugar in the UK and Poland.
The group manages these currency exposures within its risk management framework to mitigate the effect of any changes to its currency exposure profile.

The analysis covers currency translation exposures at year end on businesses financial assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of those businesses.
A similar but opposite impact would be felt on both profit and equity if the groups main operating currencies weakened against local functional currencies by a similar amount.
The following assumption has been applied in the calculation of this sensitivity, which is presented before taxation and minority interests: the exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on translating the financial statements of subsidiaries into sterling is not included in this sensitivity analysis, as there is no impact on the income statement, and the gains and losses are recorded directly in the translation reserve in equity see below for a separate sensitivity.

Financial instruments continued g Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that counterparties to financial instruments do not perform according to the terms of the contract or instrument.
The groups businesses are exposed to counterparty credit risk when dealing with customers, and from certain financing activities.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a net positive fair value by counterparty at 13 September 2008.
The group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be: 2008 2007 m m Cash and cash equivalents 348 411 Loans and receivables refer to note 25a 1,067 737 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss other current investments 9 1 derivative financial assets 3 9 Designated cash flow hedging relationships derivative financial assets 51 7 1,478 1,165 The majority of cash balances and short-term deposits are held with strong investment grade banks or financial institutions.
As at 13 September 2008, there were no significant financial guarantees or third-party obligations that increased the credit risk of the financial assets set out above.
Although the group has seen no direct evidence of changes to the credit risk of its counterparties, the current focus on financial liquidity in all international markets has introduced increased financial volatility.
The group uses market knowledge, changes in credit ratings and other techniques to identify significant changes to the financial profile of its counterparties.
Trade and other receivables Concentrations of credit risk are limited as a result of the groups large and diverse customer base.
The group has established a credit policy applied by each business under which the credit status of each new customer is reviewed before credit is advanced.
This includes external credit evaluations where possible and in some cases bank references.
Credit limits are established for all significant or high risk customers, which represent the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding without requiring additional approval from the appropriate level of management.
Outstanding debts are continually monitored by each business.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis, and at least annually.
Customers that fail to meet the groups benchmark creditworthiness may only transact with the group on a prepayment basis.
Aggregate exposures are monitored at group level.
Many of the groups customers have been transacting with the group for many years and the incidence of bad debts has been low.
Where appropriate, goods are sold subject to retention of title so that, in the event of non-payment, the group may have a secured claim.
The group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
The group provides for impairment of financial assets including trade and other receivables based on known events, and makes a collective provision for losses yet to be identified, based on historical data.
The majority of the provision comprises specific amounts.

Financial instruments continued Cash, cash equivalents and other current investments Banking relationships are generally limited to those banks that are members of the core relationship group.
These banks are selected for their credit status, global reach and their ability to meet the businesses day-to-day banking requirements.
The credit ratings of these institutions are monitored on a continuing basis.
In locations where the core relationship banking group cannot be used, operating procedures including choice of bank, opening of bank accounts and repatriation of funds must be agreed with group Treasury.
The group has not recorded impairments against cash, cash equivalents or other current investments, nor have any recoverability issues been identified with such balances.
Such items are typically recoverable on demand or in line with normal banking arrangements.
Other financial assets Other non-current investments are typically equity investments with no fixed maturity or recoverability date.
No impairment issues have been identified with respect to other non-current investments.
Since derivative assets are recorded at fair value, either through profit and loss, for those not in a designated cash flow hedging relationship, or otherwise through the hedging reserve, no impairment issues have been identified.
h Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due.
Group Treasury is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity and ensures that the group has sufficient headroom in its committed facilities to meet unforeseen or abnormal requirements.
The group also has access to uncommitted facilities to assist with short-term funding requirements.
Available headroom is monitored via the use of detailed cash flow forecasts prepared by each business, which are reviewed at least quarterly, or more often, as required.
Actual results are compared to budget and forecast each period, and variances investigated and explained.
Particular focus is given to management of working capital.

The principal reasons for differences between carrying values and contractual undiscounted cash flows are coupon payments on the secured redeemable debenture stock to which the group is already committed, future interest payments on the groups finance leases, and cash flows on derivative financial instruments which are not aligned with their fair value.
i Borrowing facilities The group has substantial borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 13 September 2008 in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met amounted to 219m 2007 269m : 2008 2007 Facility Drawn Undrawn Facility Drawn Undrawn m m m m m m US$1.2bn syndicated facility 671 469 202 598 412 186 British Sugar secured redeemable debenture stock 150 150 150 150 European Investment Bank 120 120 Zambia sugar facilities 101 101 Other 65 48 17 108 25 83 1,107 888 219 856 587 269 Uncommitted facilities available at 13 September 2008 were: 2008 2007 Facility Drawn Undrawn Facility Drawn Undrawn m m m m m m Money market lines 160 28 132 160 160 Illovo facilities 186 63 123 187 65 122 Other 238 155 83 109 71 38 584 246 338 456 136 320 In addition to the above facilities there are also 93m 2007 89m of undrawn and available credit lines for the purposes of issuing letters of credit and guarantees in the normal course of business.
The group also has 14m 2007 14m of finance lease liabilities which are not included in the tables above, but which are included in the groups interest-bearing loans and overdrafts in note 18.
Since the year end, the Company has negotiated an additional committed three-year 320m borrowing facility with its existing banking group.
The new facility will be used for general corporate purposes.
Uncommitted bank borrowing facilities are normally reaffirmed by the banks annually, although they can theoretically be withdrawn at any time.
Refer to note 9 for details of the groups capital commitments and to note 27 for a summary of the groups guarantees.
An assessment of the groups current liquidity position is given in the Financial review section of the annual report on page 17.

Financial instruments continued j Capital management The capital structure of the group is presented in the balance sheet.
Note 21 provides details on equity and note 18 on loans and overdrafts.
Short and medium-term funding requirements are provided by a variety of loan and overdraft facilities, both committed and uncommitted, with a range of counterparties and maturities.
Longer term funding is sourced from a combination of these facilities and committed syndicated loan facilities.
The boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to enable successful future development of the business.
The board monitors return on capital by division and determines the overall level of dividends payable to shareholders.
From time to time, the group purchases its own shares in the market.
The shares are purchased to satisfy awards under the groups share option scheme and long-term incentive plan.
Once purchased, shares are not sold back into the market.
The group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
There were no changes to the groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Lease commitments Operating leases The group acts as a lessee, lessor and sub-lessor for both land and buildings and plant & machinery under operating leases.
Sublease receipts of 3m 2007 3m were recognised in the income statement in the period, the majority relating to operating leases.
The total of future minimum sublease receipts expected to be received is 29m 2007 18m.
Under the terms of the lease agreements, no contingent rents are payable.
The future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Within one year 87 62 Between one and five years 308 216 After five years 1,130 932 1,525 1,210 Finance leases Finance lease liabilities are payable as follows: Minimum Minimum lease lease payments Interest Principal payments Interest Principal 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 m m m m m m Within one year 1 1 2 1 1 Between one and five years 4 3 1 4 3 1 After five years 42 30 12 42 30 12 47 33 14 48 34 14 96 Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial statements 27.
Contingencies Litigation and other proceedings against companies in the group are not considered material in the context of these financial statements.
The group has not adopted the amendments to IAS 39 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which apply for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where group companies enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other group companies, the group considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such in accordance with IFRS 4.
In this respect, the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the relevant group company issuing the guarantee will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
As at 13 September 2008, group companies have provided guarantees in the ordinary course of business amounting to 196m 2007 177m.
Related parties The group has a controlling related party relationship with its parent company, which is also its ultimate parent company see note 30.
The group also has a related party relationship with its associates and joint ventures see note 11 and with its directors.
In the course of normal operations, related party transactions entered into by the group have been contracted on an arms-length basis.

Accounting estimates and judgements Key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the accounting policies detailed on pages 52 to 57, management has made appropriate estimates in many areas and the actual outcome may differ from those calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Forecasts and discount rates The carrying values of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on estimates of future cash flows arising from the groups operations which, in some circumstances, are discounted to arrive at a net present value: The carrying value of goodwill must be assessed for impairment at least annually and also when there is an indication that it may be impaired.
This assessment involves comparing the book value of goodwill with its recoverable amount being the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use is determined with reference to projected future cash flows discounted at an appropriate rate.
Both the projected future cash flows and the discount rate applied involve a significant degree of estimation uncertainty.
The realisation of deferred tax assets recognised in the balance sheet is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets arise.
The group recognises deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered, based on an assessment of the likelihood of there being sufficient taxable profits in the future.
Post-retirement benefits The groups defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19.
The accounting valuation, which has been assessed using assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in an asset of 106m and a liability of 45m being recognised as at 13 September 2008.
The size of these assets and liabilities is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the schemes, to the discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, to the actuarial assumptions which include price inflation, rates of pension and salary increases, mortality and other demographic assumptions and to the level of contributions.
Further details are included in note 12.
Provisions As described in the accounting policies on pages 52 to 57, provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
These estimates are made taking into account a range of possible outcomes.
100 Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial statements 31.
Accounting estimates and judgements continued Property, plant & equipment residual values and useful lives These assets are written down to their estimated residual values over their anticipated useful lives using the straight-line basis.
Management reviews residual values annually considering market conditions and projected disposal values.
In assessing useful lives, maintenance programmes and technological innovations are considered.
The carrying value of property, plant & equipment is disclosed in note 9.
Biological assets Cane roots valuation the escalated average cost of planting cane roots is adjusted for the remaining expected life.
This requires an estimation by management of the average number of ratoons expected from the crop.
The carrying value of cane roots is disclosed in note 10.
Growing cane valuation growing cane is valued using the estimated sucrose content at the estimated sucrose price for the following season, less the estimated costs for harvesting and transport.
The estimated sucrose content requires management to assess the expected cane and sucrose yields for the following season considering weather conditions and harvesting programmes.
In assessing the estimated sucrose price, management is required to assess into which markets the forthcoming crop will be sold and assess domestic and export prices as well as the related foreign currency exchange rates.
The carrying value of growing cane is disclosed in note 10.
Cash flow hedge accounting The group enters into various types of hedging or forward contacts for the buying and selling of currencies and commodities.
The contracts often fall within the scope of IAS 39 and accordingly have to be marked to market.
Where appropriate, these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, which allows, to the extent the hedges are effective, the change in values of the derivatives to be deferred in equity.
In order to achieve and maintain cash flow hedge accounting, it is necessary for the group to determine, at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether a forecast transaction is highly probable and whether the hedge is effective.
This requires both subjective and objective measures of determination.
Exceptional items The directors consider that items of income or expense which are material by virtue of their nature and amount should be disclosed separately if the financial statements are to fairly present the financial position and financial performance of the entity.
The directors label these items collectively as exceptional items.
Determining which transactions are to be considered exceptional in nature is often a subjective matter.
However, circumstances that the directors believe would give rise to exceptional items for separate disclosure might include major business restructurings, impairments and reversals of impairments.
All exceptional items are included in the appropriate income statement line item to which they relate.
In addition, for clarity, separate disclosure is made of all exceptional items in one column on the face of the income statement, with additional explanation in the notes.
Taxation The income tax expense recorded in the income statement is dependent on the tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date, unless new tax rates have been enacted or substantively enacted.
The level of current and deferred tax recognised is also dependent on subjective judgements as to the outcome of decisions to be made by the tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions around the world in which the group operates.
It is necessary to consider the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised based on an assessment of the extent to which they are regarded as recoverable.
Fair values on acquisition The group is required to bring acquired assets and liabilities on to the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value.
Items of plant and equipment and the associated property interests often have long operating lives, hence determination of the fair values can require a significant degree of judgement.
Acquisitions often also result in significant intangible benefits being brought into the group, some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets.
Other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of accounting standards and form part of goodwill.
Significant judgement can be required in the assessment and valuation of these intangible assets, often with reference to internal data and models.
Professional valuers are engaged where it is deemed appropriate to do so.
Fair values on major acquisitions are disclosed in note 22.
