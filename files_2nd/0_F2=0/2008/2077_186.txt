2. Business and geographical segments Business segments We operate nine Customer Sector Groups aligned with the commodities which we extract and market: Customer Sector Group Principal activities Petroleum Oil and gas exploration, production, development and marketing Aluminium Mining of bauxite, refining of bauxite into alumina and smelting of alumina into aluminium metal Base Metals Mining of copper, silver, lead, zinc, molybdenum, uranium and gold Diamonds and Specialty Products Mining of diamonds and titanium minerals Stainless Steel Materials Mining and production of nickel products Iron Ore Mining of iron ore Manganese Mining of manganese ore and production of manganese metal and alloys Metallurgical Coal Mining of metallurgical coal Energy Coal Mining and marketing of thermal energy coal Group and unallocated items represent Group centre functions and certain comparative data for divested assets and investments.
Exploration and technology activities, which were previously recognised as part of Group and unallocated items, are now recognised within relevant segments as a result of a change in management responsibilities over such activities.
This change in segment reporting has been reflected in all periods presented and resulted in operating costs of US$149 million 30 June 2007: US$139 million: 30 June 2006: US$134 million being reported in individual segments rather than Group and unallocated items.
Amounts allocated to any individual segment are insignificant.
It is the Groups policy that inter-segment sales are made on a commercial basis.
b EBITDA is profit from operations, before depreciation, amortisation and impairments.
