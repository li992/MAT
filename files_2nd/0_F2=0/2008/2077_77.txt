3 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS continued 3.7 Liquidity and capital resources As a result of our record production volumes and record prices in many of our key commodities over the past several years, we have generated very strong cash flows throughout our operations.
These cash flows have been fundamental to our ability to internally fund our existing operations, maintain a pipeline of 28 growth projects, and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buy-backs.
Our priority for cash is to reinvest in the business.
In line with our strategy, we have grown our business rapidly and consistently through project developments and acquisitions.
Through a combination of borrowings and payments to shareholders, we manage our balance sheet with the goal of maintaining levels of gearing that we believe optimise our costs of capital and return on capital employed.
Net operating cash flows are our principal source of cash.
We also raise cash from debt financing to manage temporary fluctuations in liquidity arrangements and to refinance existing debt.
Our liquidity position is supported by our strong and stable credit rating and committed debt facilities.
