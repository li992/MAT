Derivative financial instruments The Company holds derivative financial instruments in accordance with the Groups policy in relation to financial risk management.
Details of that policy are set out in note 33 of the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The carrying value of derivative financial instruments held by the Company was as follows: As at 3 January 2009 As at 29 December 2007 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities $ million $ million $ million $ million Carrying value Interest rate swaps 16.1 2.2 Interest rate swaps are used to swap borrowings by the Company under the Groups EMTN Programme from fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.
These contracts have been designated and are effective as fair value hedges in relation to the borrowings.
During 2008, the Company recognised a fair value gain of $18.9 million 2007: gain of $2.8 million in relation to these contracts and the carrying amount of the hedged borrowings was increased by $20.1 million 2007: increased by $1.4 million to reflect the change in the fair value of the borrowings attributable to the hedged risk and the amortisation of the transitional adjustment that was recognised on adoption of FRS 26.
During 2008, a net loss of $1.2 million 2007: net gain of $1.4 million was therefore recognised in the profit and loss account in relation to these hedges.
The profile of interest rate swaps held by the Company was as follows: Interest rate Payable Receivable Notional principal amount Variable rate million Variable Fixed index As at 3 January 2009 Maturity date December 2011 150.0 5.7% 8.0% 6 month LIBOR As at 29 December 2007 Maturity date December 2011 150.0 8.6% 8.0% 6 month LIBOR 12.
Defined contribution schemes The Company provides defined contribution pension benefits to those of its employees who are not eligible to participate in its defined benefit pension plans.
The expense recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of those plans represents the contributions payable by the Company for the period at rates that are specified in the rules of the plans.
At the balance sheet date, the Company had paid over all contributions due to the plans.
Defined benefit schemes The Company operates a number of funded defined benefit pension plans in the UK that provide benefits based upon final pensionable salary and the period of service of the individual employees.
The plan assets are held separately from the Companys assets in funds that are under the control of trustees.
Day-to-day management of the plan assets is carried out by independent investment managers who, at the request of the Company, are prohibited by the trustees from investing directly in the Company.
Certain employees and former employees whose pension benefits exceed the maximum that may be provided from the Companys defined benefit pension plans are entitled to an additional unfunded pension payable directly by the Company after their retirement.
The defined benefit pension plans operated by the Company are closed to new entrants.

The return and risk expectations for each asset class incorporate assumptions about historical return relationships, current financial market conditions and the degree of global capital market integration.
The assumptions used have been derived from rigorous historical performance analysis combined with forward-looking views of the financial markets as revealed through the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices.
The actuaries review analyses of historical risk and the correlation of the return on asset classes and apply subjective judgment based on their knowledge of the Companys plans.
The result of this analysis is incorporated into a risk matrix from which expected longterm risk premiums for each asset class are developed.
The nominal return expectations are determined by combining the asset class risk premiums with expected inflation and real risk-free rate assumptions.
As a final consideration, the nominal return assumptions are blended with current market conditions to develop long-term equilibrium expectations.
The actual loss on plan assets was 5.1% 2007: gain of 5.7%.

The Company expects to contribute approximately $6.8 million to the defined benefit pension plans in 2009.
Background The Company operates a number of share-based compensation arrangements to provide incentives to the Groups senior executives and other eligible employees.
Details of the schemes in respect of which options and awards are outstanding are set out in the Remuneration Committee report.
Although the Companys ordinary shares are now denominated in US dollars, they continue to be quoted in sterling on the London Stock Exchange.
The information provided below relates only to options and awards that were granted to persons who are employees of the Company.
Share options Following a review by the Board in 2004, it was decided that the Companys executive share option schemes would not be renewed when they lapsed for the purposes of new awards in May 2005.
Awards granted under these schemes were subject to a performance condition that the rate of increase in the Groups earnings per share must exceed the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by an average of 2% per annum over any three-year period after the options were granted.
The final unvested options under these schemes vested during 2007.
Options continue to be granted from time to time under the Companys Sharesave scheme, which is restricted to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the UK.
It offers eligible employees the option to buy ordinary shares in Tomkins plc after a period of three, five or seven years funded from the proceeds of a savings contract to which employees may contribute up to 250 per month.
In 2008, the compensation expense recognised in respect of share options was $nil 2007: $1.0 million.
Company financial statements 147 Company financial statements Changes in the total number of share options outstanding to employees of the Company during the period were as follows: Year ended 3 January 2009 Year ended 29 December 2007 Weighted average Weighted average Options exercise price Options exercise price Number Pence Number Pence Outstanding at the beginning of the period 10,602,911 243.06 10,708,870 243.30 Granted during the period 117,551 140.20 28,727 211.40 Forfeited during the period 127,304 215.33 30,840 226.57 Exercised during the period 103,846 263.46 Lapsed during the period 790,500 253.57 Outstanding at the end of the period 9,802,658 241.34 10,602,911 243.06 Exercisable at the end of the period 9,623,128 242.73 4,787,486 241.74 No options were exercised during 2008.
On the dates on which options were exercised during 2007, the weighted average market price of the Companys ordinary shares was 287.47p per share.
The fair value of options granted under the Sharesave scheme was measured at their respective grant dates using the BlackScholes option-pricing formula based on the following assumptions: Year ended Year ended 3 January 29 December 2009 2007 Weighted average fair value 37.66p 69.34p Weighted average assumptions: Share price 176.75p 264.25p Exercise price 140.20p 211.40p Expected volatility 24.46% 24.08% Expected life 4.47 years 3.96 years Risk-free interest rate 4.55% 5.29% Expected dividends 13.89p 13.89p Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the shorter of the expected life of the options and the period since the beginning of the Companys financial year ended 30 April 2002 when, following a period of significant demerger activity, the Group was refocused on its remaining core businesses.
Adjustments have been made to the expected life used in the model to reflect the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The weighted average contractual life of share options outstanding to the Companys employees at the end of the period was as follows: As at 3 January 2009 As at 29 December 2007 Weighted average Weighted average remaining remaining Outstanding contractual life Outstanding contractual life Number Years Number Years Range of exercise prices: 100p to 150p 107,948 4.16 151p to 200p 3,088,072 3.10 3,088,072 4.12 201p to 250p 2,832,842 4.84 3,424,635 5.88 251p to 300p 2,758,568 3.92 3,074,976 4.85 301p and higher 1,015,228 3.10 1,015,228 4.12 9,802,658 10,602,911 148 Notes to the financial statements continued 13.

During 2008, awards were granted over 2,103,039 ordinary shares under the PSP 2007: 2,295,249 ordinary shares.
The fair value of awards made under the ABIP is measured based on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of the award.
Where the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the expected life of the awards.
The weighted average fair value of awards made under these schemes during the period was 129.34p 2007: 215.68p.
The fair value of awards made under the PSP was measured at their respective grant dates using the Monte-Carlo valuation model based on the following assumptions: Year ended Year ended 3 January 29 December 2009 2007 Weighted average fair value 34.20p 42.87p Weighted average assumptions: Expected volatility 37.49% 28.73% Expected life 3.00 years 3.00 years Risk-free interest rate 4.57% 4.44% Dividend yield 9.97% 5.00% Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the expected life of the awards.
In 2008, the compensation expense recognised in respect of other awards was $2.3 million 2007: $4.2 million.

Deferred tax assets will be recognised when it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets not recognised were as follows: As at As at 3 January 29 December 2009 2007 $ million $ million Depreciation in excess of tax allowances 1.6 1.8 Share-based incentives 0.3 0.6 Pensions 1.5 3.2 Other timing differences 1.5 0.2 4.9 5.8 Company financial statements 149 Company financial statements 15.

Following approval by the Companys shareholders and pursuant to an Order of the High Court of Justice in England and Wales, the share capital of the Company was reduced by cancelling and extinguishing all of the issued and unissued ordinary shares of 5 pence each.
The amount standing to the credit of share capital was transferred to a specially created cancellation reserve where it was retranslated into US dollars at the exchange rate ruling at the close of business in London on 21 May 2008 of 1 $1.96 giving rise to a currency translation loss of $1.3 million.
The cancellation reserve was then applied by issuing new ordinary shares of 9 cents each to holders of the cancelled ordinary shares of 5 pence each on a one-for-one basis.
The redenomination did not affect the rights of the holders of ordinary shares.

Accordingly, immediately upon the reduction of capital and before the issue and allotment of the new ordinary shares, the Company increased its capital by 50,000 by the creation of 50,000 deferred shares of 1 each which were paid up in full at par by capitalisation of the equivalent amount standing to the credit of the Companys share premium account.
The deferred shares are not listed on any investment exchange and have extremely limited rights such that they effectively have no value.
It is intended that the deferred shares will be held by either the Company Secretary or by a Director of the Company they are currently held by the Company Secretary.
Following the implementation of section 542 of the Companies Act 2006 on 1 October 2009, the Company will no longer be required to have any share capital denominated in sterling.
Accordingly, the Company intends to buy back and cancel the deferred shares as soon as practicable after 1 October 2009.
