The charge for the year ended 31 December 2008 amounts to US$90 million.
The Groups share of this charge included in the results for the year ended 31 December 2008 amounts to 12 million net of tax.
Following the change in Group accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses as explained in note 1 and note 12, the investment in associates and joint ventures on the Group balance sheet at 31 December 2007 has been increased by 47 million note 11, with a corresponding entry to equity.
The change in accounting policy did not have any impact on the results from associates for 2008 and 2007.

There are over 20 companies in the FII GLO.
The case concerns the treatment for UK corporate tax purposes of profits earned overseas and distributed to the UK.
The claim was filed in 2003 and the case was heard in the European Court of Justice ECJ in 2005 and a decision of the ECJ received in December 2006.
In July 2008, the case reverted to a trial in the UK High Court for the UK Court to determine how the principles of the ECJ decision should be applied in a UK context.
The High Court judgment in November 2008 concludes, amongst many other things, that dividends received from EU subsidiaries should be, and should have been, exempt from UK taxation.
It also concludes that certain dividends received before 5 April 1999 from the EU and, in some limited circumstances after 1993 from outside the EU, should have been treated as franked investment income with the consequence that advance corporation tax need not have been paid.
Claims for the repayment of UK tax incurred where the dividends were from the EU can be made back to 1973.
The case will now proceed to the Court of Appeal.
The tentative conclusion reached in the judgment would, if upheld, produce an estimated receivable of about 1.2 billion for British American Tobacco.
The potential receipt of some or all of the amount referred to above has not been recognised in the results of the Group due to uncertainty of the amounts and eventual outcome.
