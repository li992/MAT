Taxation continued The tax charge for the year is higher than the weighted average rate for the year.
The difference is explained below: Restated 2008 2007 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 191,406 143,060 Tax at the weighted average rate of corporation tax of 40.56% 2007: 38.49% 77,634 55,064 Disallowed expenses and non-taxable income 5,226 18,194 Supplementary charge differences on finance income and costs 2,172 1,803 Tax losses utilised not previously recognised brought back 1,118 711 Tax losses not utilised 2 10 PRT 10,192 8,196 Allowable deduction for PRT 5,981 4,459 Foreign tax calculation differences 818 308 Adjustment in respect of prior years 2,614 987 5,690 Non qualifying depreciation 3,414 Other 9 185 Total tax expense reported in the income statement 94,248 80,031 The weighted average rate of corporation tax of 40.56% 2007: 38.49% is calculated using the following methodology.
Tax charges are calculated by applying the statutory tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to the profit before tax for each entity.
The sum of the tax charges for each entity is then divided by the Group accounting profit before tax to derive the weighted average rate of corporation tax for the year.
The weighted average rate of corporation tax has changed from the previous accounting period due to differences in the weighted average mix of profits in each tax jurisdiction and also due to the inclusion of a full year of Norwegian and Egyptian taxable profits and the applicable tax rates.
c Unrecognised tax losses The Group has unrecognised tax losses which arose in Egypt of 46,192,000 2007: 33,445,000 in respect of exploration activities outside the ring-fence, that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised as it is not probable that the asset is recoverable.
The asset is recoverable if there were future suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
d Temporary differences associated with Group investments At 31 December 2008, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2007: Nil for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Groups subsidiaries as the Group has determined that undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the near future.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax has not been recognised aggregate to 738,000 2007: 682,000.
