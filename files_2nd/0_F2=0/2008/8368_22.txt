The Group financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2008 consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in associates.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Groups activities are the testing, inspection and certification of products and commodities against a wide range of safety, regulatory, quality and performance standards.
Note 3 provides a segmental analysis of the Groups performance.
2 Significant accounting policies a Statement of compliance The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 112 to 115. b Basis of preparation The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The Group has adopted in the year the following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations, which have had no impact on the financial statements: Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Reclassification of Financial Instruments IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs, requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements, is discussed in note w. Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial assets are stated at fair value.
Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
All information presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest 100,000.
Going concern The Board has reviewed forecasts, including forecasts adjusted for significantly worse economic conditions, and remains satisfied with the Groups funding and liquidity position.
On the basis of its forecasts, both base case and stressed, and available facilities, which are described in note 17, the Board has concluded that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate.
c Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.
For purchases of minority interest in subsidiaries, the Group applies the entity concept method.
Under this method, the entire difference between the cost of the additional interest in the subsidiary, and the minority interests share of the assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at the date of acquisition of the minority interests, is reflected directly in the shareholders equity.
Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Groups carrying amount of that interest is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has a legal or constructive obligation or has made payments on behalf of an associate.
The Group does not consider the associates to be an integral part of the Groups operations and therefore its results are presented outside of the Group operating profit.
indd 72 6 3 09 15:51:32 73 Annual Report 2008 73 2 Significant accounting policies continued Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
d Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement except those arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign operation and on retranslation of available-for-sale equity instruments which are recognised directly in equity.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values were determined.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at cumulative average rates of exchange during the year.
The most significant currencies for the Group were translated at the following exchange rates: Balance sheet Income statement Actual rates Cumulative average rates Value of 1 31 Dec 08 31 Dec 07 2008 2007 US dollar 1.46 1.99 1.87 2.00 Euro 1.02 1.36 1.26 1.46 Chinese renminbi 9.95 14.57 13.03 15.24 Hong Kong dollar 11.28 15.51 14.59 15.62 Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations, and of related qualifying hedges are taken directly to equity in the translation reserve.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal.
The Group has taken advantage of relief available in IFRS 1, to deem the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be zero at the date of transition to IFRSs on 1 January 2004.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are discussed in accounting policy g. e Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity i. e. forming part of shareholders funds only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: i they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and ii where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Companys exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
f Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge economically its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value: attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, in which case the recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see accounting policy g. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the difference between the quoted forward price and the exercise price of the contract.
com Notes to the financial statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued g Hedging Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement in the same period that the hedged item affects the income statement.
Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used economically to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity in a translation reserve.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the hedged net investment is disposed of, the cumulative amount in equity is transferred to the income statement as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal.
Available-for-sale financial assets The Groups investments in equity securities are classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses which are recognised in the income statement, and foreign currency differences on available-for-sale monetary items see note d, are recognised directly in equity.
When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
h Property, plant and equipment Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation see below and accumulated impairment losses see accounting policy m. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Gains and losses on disposal of items of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised in profit or loss.
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Leased assets Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under finance leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance leases are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Other leases are operating leases.
These leased assets are not recognised on the Groups balance sheet.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives, unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold buildings Term of lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment 310 years Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of all assets are re-assessed at each reporting date.
i Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses.
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses see accounting policy m. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investments in associates.
indd 74 5 3 09 23:49:22 75 Annual Report 2008 75 2 Significant accounting policies continued The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by IFRS 1 and has not restated goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework.
Purchased goodwill in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition, in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions.
If at the balance sheet date the fair values of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be established provisionally, then these values are used.
Any adjustments to these values made within 12 months of the acquisition date are taken as adjustments to goodwill.
Other intangible assets Other than goodwill, intangible assets arising on acquisitions and computer software, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable, and which have finite useful lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Computer software Up to 5 years Customer relationships Up to 10 years Know-how Up to 5 years Licences Contractual life Covenants not to compete Contractual life j Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently are stated at their amortised cost less impairment losses see accounting policy m. k Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of the inventories is based on the first-in-first-out FIFO principle.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing inventories to their present condition and location and net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated selling costs.
l Cash and cash equivalents and net debt Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Net debt comprises borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
m Impairment Financial assets A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired.
A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis.
The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is estimated at each reporting date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
com Notes to the financial statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist as a result of a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
n Dividends Interim dividends are recognised as a movement in equity when they are paid.
Final dividends are reported as a movement in equity in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders.
o Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
p Employee benefits Defined contribution plan A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value.
Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.
The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of i an unconditional right to a refund from the plan or ii reductions in future contributions to the plan as measured by the estimated future service cost less the estimated minimum funding contributions required in respect of the future accrual of benefits in that year.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
In addition a provision for future minimum funding contributions is recorded to the extent that such payments are required to cover an existing shortfall, as measured on a minimum funding contribution basis, and having been paid will not be available as a refund or a reduction in future contributions to the plan.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities expected to arise from the employees services in the accounting period is charged to the operating profit in the income statement.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest on the present value of the schemes liabilities, during the accounting period, are shown as finance income and finance expense respectively.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in equity.
Share-based payment transactions The share-based compensation plans operated by the Group allow employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of share options or shares, is measured at the grant date and is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The charge is calculated using the Black-Scholes method and expensed to the income statement over the vesting period of the relevant award.
The charge for the share options and for the share awards is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting where conditions are non-market based.
The expense of the share awards under the deferred bonus plan is also adjusted for the probability of performance conditions being achieved.
The Group has taken advantage of the provisions of IFRS 1: First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, and has recognised an expense only in respect of share options and share awards granted since 7 November 2002.
Own shares held by ESOT trust Transactions of the Group sponsored ESOT trust are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
q Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
r Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently are stated at their amortised cost.
s Revenue Revenue represents the total amount receivable for services rendered, excluding sales related taxes and intra group transactions.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the income statement when the relevant service is completed, usually when the report of findings is issued or in certain circumstances, in proportion to the stage of completion, normally determined by reference to costs incurred to date in proportion to the total anticipated costs of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
indd 76 5 3 09 23:49:22 77 Annual Report 2008 77 2 Significant accounting policies continued t Expenses Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term of the lease.
Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest expense on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, facility fees, interest receivable on funds invested, net foreign exchange gains or losses on external interest, income and expense relating to pension assets and liabilities, and gains and losses on hedging instruments, that are recognised in the income statement see accounting policy g. Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues using the effective interest rate method.
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
u Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: overseas retained earnings, the distribution of which is under the control of the Group, and which are not likely to be distributed in the foreseeable future: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Any additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
v Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing services to a particular industry business segment or in providing services within a particular economic environment geographic segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
w Significant accounting judgements and estimates In applying the Groups accounting policies described above, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Also discussed below, are key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation at the balance sheet date, that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Claims see notes 19 and 29 In making provision for claims, management bases its judgement on the circumstances relating to each specific event, internal and external legal advice, knowledge of the industries and markets, prevailing commercial terms and legal precedents.
The Groups legal and warranty claims are reviewed, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis by senior management.
Intangible assets see note 11 When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible assets should be recognised separately from goodwill.
If such an asset is identified, then it is valued by discounting the probable future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, over the estimated life of the asset.
Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic benefit and the useful life, this is factored into the calculation.
Impairment of goodwill see note 11 The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value-in-use, requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit that holds the goodwill, at a determined discount rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Contingent consideration see notes 19 and 26 When the Group acquires businesses, the total consideration may consist of an amount paid on completion plus further amounts payable on agreed post completion dates.
These further amounts are contingent on the acquired business meeting agreed performance targets.
At the date of acquisition, the Group reviews the profit and cash forecasts for the acquired business and estimates the amount of contingent consideration that is likely to be due.
com Notes to the financial statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued Recoverability of trade receivables see note 28 Trade receivables are reflected net of an estimated provision for impairment losses.
This provision is based primarily on a review of all outstanding accounts and considers the past payment history and creditworthiness of each account and the length of time that the debt has remained unpaid.
The actual amounts of debts that ultimately prove irrecoverable could vary from the actual provision made.
Employee post-retirement benefit obligations see note 24 The Group has three principal defined pension benefit plans.
The obligations under these plans are recognised in the balance sheet and represent the present value of the obligation calculated by independent actuaries, with input from management.
These actuarial valuations include assumptions such as discount rates, return on assets, salary progression and mortality rates.
These assumptions vary from time to time according to prevailing economic and social conditions.
Deferred tax see note 14 Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised.
In particular, judgement is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, with consideration given to the timing and level of future taxable income.
Income tax see note 8 The actual tax on profits is determined according to complex tax laws and regulations.
Where the effect of these laws and regulations is unclear, estimates are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid on past profits which are recognised in the financial statements.
The Group considers the estimates, assumptions and judgements to be reasonable but this can involve complex issues which may take a number of years to resolve.
The final determination of prior year tax liabilities could be different from the estimates reflected in the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation see note 26 Judgement is applied when determining if an entity acquired is controlled by the Group, and therefore is defined as a subsidiary.
Control is presumed to exist when the Group owns, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more than half of the voting power of an entity.
However, even if the Group owns half or less of the voting power of an entity, control may still exist.
In assessing control, the Group considers whether it has the ability to control on a legal or contractual basis rather than whether that control actually is exercised.
Specific examples of where the Group has control of subsidiaries are where it has the power to govern the entitys financial and operating policies by virtue of statute or agreement and where it has the power to cast the majority of votes of the entitys governing body.
x New standards and interpretations not yet adopted The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2008, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements: IFRS 8: Operating Segments Revised IAS 23: Borrowing Costs Amendment to IFRS 2: Share based Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations Revised IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements The adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the income, expenses, assets and liabilities of the Group, although there will be changes to the presentation of the financial statements.
3 Segment reporting Segment information is presented in respect of the Groups business and geographical segments.
The primary format, business segments, is based on the way the Group considers its business.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms-length basis.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise mainly borrowings, pension fund liabilities, and corporate expenses and assets.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire property, plant and equipment, and computer software.
Business segments From 1 January 2008, the Group is organised into seven operating divisions: Consumer Goods, Commercial & Electrical, Oil, Chemical & Agri, Government Services, Analytical Services, Industrial Services and Minerals.
The costs of the corporate head office and other costs which are not controlled by the operating divisions are allocated to these divisions.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Principal activities are as follows: Consumer Goods provides services to the textiles, footwear, toys, food and hardlines industries.
Commercial & Electrical provides testing, inspection and certification services to industries including those in the home appliances, medical, building, industrial and HVAC R, IT and telecom and automotive sectors.
Oil, Chemical & Agri provides independent cargo inspection, laboratory testing, calibration and related technical services to the worlds energy, petroleum, chemical and agricultural industries.
Government Services provides trade services to standards bodies and governments.
Analytical Services provides laboratory services to the chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetics personal care, oil and gas and automotive aerospace industries.
indd 78 5 3 09 23:49:23 79 Annual Report 2008 79 3 Segment reporting continued Industrial Services provides high-value audit services to a wide range of industries in both the manufacturing and services sectors and quality and safety services to oil and gas, industrial and process industries.
Minerals provides inspection, testing and advisory services to the mining and exploration industries.
Prior to 1 January 2008, the Group was organised into four divisions: Oil, Chemical & Agri, Commercial & Electrical, Consumer Goods and Government Services.

9 Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
In addition to the earnings per share required by IAS 33: Earnings Per Share, an adjusted earnings per share has also been calculated and is based on earnings excluding the effect of amortisation of acquisition intangibles, goodwill impairment and non-recurring costs.
It has been calculated to allow shareholders to have a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group.

The acquisitions have been reviewed and since each of them offer broadly similar services to those already offered by the Intertek Groups existing businesses, it is considered appropriate to use the same assumptions in each of the impairment calculations.
In each case the recoverable amount of the cash generating units, determined upon a value-in-use calculation, was higher than its carrying amount, except for those discussed below.
Management approved forecasts for each cash generating unit are used in these calculations.
These forecasts cover a two-year period and are based on the most current information relating to each business unit.
Beyond two years, management consider that it is difficult to forecast accurately the business growth for each individual unit.
In Interteks business, most contractual relationships with customers are short-term.
Despite this, the Group has a strong historical track record of growth.
Therefore, when looking at longer term growth not exceeding five years, a steady conservative growth rate of 5% is used for all business units.
This is considered to be a reasonable assumption based on the long-term historical growth rate in profits of the Intertek businesses.
A terminal cash flow is calculated in year five by multiplying the year four cash flow forecast by a multiple which is considered appropriate to each acquisition.
In the 2008 impairment review the multiples ranged from 5.0 to 12.0.
A Group pre-tax, risk adjusted, discount rate of 10.9% 2007: 10.8% has been used in the value-in-use calculations.
The characteristics of the businesses acquired are that they are not capital intensive and are largely similar to each other, and therefore the rate of 10.9%, which is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, is considered to be the most appropriate rate.
The key sensitivities for the impairment tests are the assumed growth rates in profit and the discount rate.
A reduction of 1.0% to 4.0% in the profit growth rate and an increase of 1.0% to 11.9% in the discount rate would not change the conclusion of the impairment tests.
There are 36 2007: 45 cash generating units with a goodwill amount that is not significant in relation to the carrying value of goodwill of 242.1m 2007: 148.4m.
The aggregate balance of goodwill for these multiple cash generating units is 117.1m 2007: 72.7m.
The recoverable amount of all these units was determined following the same assumptions as for the individually significant units disclosed above.
com Notes to the financial statements 11 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued In 2008, an impairment charge of 0.5m was recognised within administrative expenses in the Commercial & Electrical division in respect of the goodwill of Intertek Testing and Certification Limited.
This was necessitated by lower than expected trading results.
The goodwill impairment was based on a calculation of the recoverable amount based on value-in-use, using projected cash flows for this business, discounted by a pre-tax rate of 10.9%.
The charge of 0.5m represented the shortfall of the recoverable amount to the carrying value.
The carrying amount of goodwill after the impairment was 5.5m.
No other goodwill impairment losses were identified.
In 2007, an impairment charge of 0.4m was recognised within administrative expenses in the Commercial & Electrical division in respect of the goodwill of a certification business in India, which was acquired by the Group in 2005.
This was necessitated by lower than expected trading results since acquisition.
The goodwill impairment was based on a calculation of the recoverable amount based on value-in-use, using projected cash flows for this business, discounted by a pre-tax rate of 10.8%.
The charge of 0.4m represented the shortfall of the recoverable amount to the carrying value.
The carrying amount of goodwill after the impairment was 0.8m.
There are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.

In August 2007, an additional 100.0m tranche was added making a total facility of 400.0m.
In June 2008, the Group amended the facility to allow a further 120.0m to be borrowed under the same facility.
Of this 120.0m, 75.0m was committed in the year from three further banks to make a syndicate of 13 banks.
The committed i. e. contractually obligated amount of debt facilities from these 13 banks was 387.0m as at 31 December 2008.
The facility was originally for five years expiring on 15 December 2009, with two one-year extension options to extend this up to a further two years.
The facility was extended by a year in 2005 and by a further year in 2006.
The facility now expires in December 2011.
The facility comprises four tranches.
Facility A is a 14.0m multi-currency term loan original 70.0m less repayments to 31 December 2008 with bi-annual equal amortisations over the remaining year.
Facility B is a 225.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility, available up to 15 December 2011.
Facility C is a 364 day, 48.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility original 80.0m less repayments to 31 December 2008 of 32.0m, with the option to convert this, at any time by written notice, into a term loan expiring 364 days from the date of notice.
This amount has been included in debt falling due between one and two years.

From time-to-time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business.
The outcome of such litigation and the timing of any potential liability cannot be readily foreseen, as it is often subject to legal proceedings.
Based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
The provision for claims of 11.6m 2007: 7.5m represents an estimate of the amounts payable in connection with identified claims from customers, former employees and other plaintiffs and associated legal costs.
The timing of the cash outflow relating to the provisions is uncertain but is likely to be within one year.

com Notes to the financial statements 24 Employee benefits Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
In most locations, these are defined contribution arrangements.
However, there are significant defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom and one in Hong Kong.
The United Kingdom schemes are the Intertek Pension Scheme and the Capcis Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme that came into the Group through the acquisition of the Umitek group in January 2007.
These are funded schemes, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Other funded defined benefit schemes are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted for as if they were defined contribution schemes.
The schemes in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong were closed to new entrants in 2002 and 2000, respectively.
The Group recognises any actuarial gains and losses in each period in equity through the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.

The last full triennial actuarial valuation of The Intertek Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom was carried out as at 1 April 2007, but this has been updated to 31 December 2008 for IAS 19 purposes.
The last full triennial actuarial valuation of the Capcis Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme in the UK was also carried out as at 1 April 2007 and this has been updated to 31 December 2008 for IAS 19 purposes.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Hong Kong scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2007, for local accounting purposes but this has been updated to 31 December 2008 for IAS 19 purposes.

The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio.
Where investments are held in bonds and cash, the expected long-term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on such assets at the balance sheet date.
A higher rate of return is expected on equity investments.
This is based on an out-performance assumption over gilt yields.

Since the amount of the lump sum is not related to the life expectancy of the members, the post-retirement mortality is not a relevant assumption for the Hong Kong scheme.
The table above shows the number of years a male or female is expected to live, assuming they were aged either 40 or 65 at 31 December.
The 2007 mortality assumptions are based on an actuarial table PA 92 medium cohort, projected by an individuals year of birth.

Of the 11.7m, 10.4m is shown in provisions note 19 and 1.3m is included in trade and other payables note 18. a HP White Laboratory Inc The largest acquisition was the purchase on 24 September 2008, of 100% of the share capital of HP White Laboratory Inc, a company incorporated in the USA, which provides ballistic resistance testing of protective equipment and which also tests ammunition and firearms.
This acquisition will strengthen the service offering of Interteks Commercial & Electrical division.
Initial cash consideration, inclusive of expenses, was 20.2m and additional contingent consideration of 1.5m is estimated to be payable.
This acquisition fits within Interteks Life Safety Services strategy by not only expanding its capability in the personal protective equipment sector but more importantly enabling it to enter the ballistic testing services market.

com Notes to the financial statements 28 Financial instruments continued ii Impairment losses The ageing of trade receivables at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2008 2007 m m Under 3 months 188.3 126.5 Between 3 and 6 months 24.6 15.6 Between 6 and 12 months 10.5 7.5 Over 12 months 6.0 4.3 Gross trade receivables 229.4 153.9 Allowance for impairment 10.0 6.4 Trade receivables, net of allowance 219.4 147.5 Included in trade receivables due under three months of 188.3m 2007: 126.5m are trade receivables of 104.0m 2007: 69.1m which are not due for payment under the Groups standard terms and conditions of sale.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: Impairment allowance for doubtful trade receivables 2008 2007 m m At 1 January 6.4 5.0 Exchange differences 1.6 0.3 Cash recovered 0.1 0.2 Impairment loss recognised 4.4 3.0 Receivables written off 2.3 1.7 At 31 December 10.0 6.4 There were no significant individual impairments of trade receivables.
Credit risks arise mainly from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
The Group assesses periodically the creditworthiness of customers.
The Groups credit risk is diversified due to the large number of entities that make up the Groups customer base and the diversification across many different industries and geographic regions.
Allowance for impairment is based on the risk profile of the trade receivable based on the likelihood of the amount being recovered.
Based on historic default rates reflecting the track record of payments by the Groups customers, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables which are less than six months outstanding, unless there are specific circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a customer which would render the trade receivable irrecoverable.
The Group provides fully for all trade receivables over 12 months old as these are considered likely to be irrecoverable.
Where recovery is in doubt, a provision is made against the specific trade receivable until such time as the Group believes the amount to be irrecoverable.
At that time the trade receivable is written off.
iii Counterparty Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with counterparties who have sound credit ratings.
Given this, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

Interest rate swaps, denominated in various currencies and an interest rate cap have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure within the Groups policy.
The swaps mature over the next three years and have fixed swap rates ranging from 1.1% to 4.8%.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional contract amount of 136.6m 2007: 55.4m and an interest rate cap with a notional value of 19.6m 2007: 14.7m.
The Group designates interest rate swaps and interest rate caps as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of swaps and caps at 31 December 2008, was 4.5m 2007: 0.7m comprising liabilities of 4.5m 2007: 0.7m.
These amounts were recognised as fair value derivatives.
Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
ii Profile The information about the contractual maturities and interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings is shown in section b liquidity risk.
The interest rate profile of the Groups short-term deposits and cash at 31 December 2008 is set out below: Total carrying Effective At floating amount and interest rates interest rates Interest free fair value Financial assets m m m Short-term deposits and cash : Sterling 1.0% 5.7 0.5 6.2 US dollar 0.3% 22.0 1.9 23.9 Chinese renminbi 1.5% 33.5 0.7 34.2 Hong Kong dollar 0.3% 4.3 0.1 4.4 Euro 1.5% 8.5 1.2 9.7 Other currencies Various 29.4 5.5 34.9 Total cash and cash equivalents 103.4 9.9 113.3 Short-term deposits are overnight deposits bearing interest at rates fixed daily in advance.

indd 108 5 3 09 23:48:03 109 Annual Report 2008 109 28 Financial instruments continued iii Sensitivity At 31 December 2008, it is estimated that a general increase of three percentage points in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit before tax by approximately 2.6m 2007: 2.7m at a three percentage point increase and 1.2m at a one percentage point increase.
A three percentage point increase has been used in the current year compared to a one percentage point increase in the prior year accounts sensitivity analysis to reflect the current economic environment.
Interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
d Foreign currency risk The net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Groups shareholders funds and a substantial percentage of the Groups revenue and operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling.
Because of the high proportion of international activity, the Groups profit is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Two types of risk arise as a result: i translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling and ii transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups commercial cash flows in various currencies.
i Profile The foreign currency profile of the trade receivables and payables at the balance sheet date were as follows: Hong Carrying Chinese Kong Other amount Sterling US dollar renminbi dollar Euro currencies 2008 m m m m m m m Trade receivables 219.4 26.4 64.8 23.8 11.7 30.5 62.2 Trade payables 54.0 7.7 12.8 11.0 4.1 7.7 10.7 2007 Trade receivables 147.5 18.1 41.1 14.5 9.2 20.0 44.6 Trade payables 43.1 6.4 9.2 8.2 3.0 6.3 10.0 ii Recognised assets and liabilities Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
At 31 December 2008, the fair value of forward exchange contracts was nil 2007: nil.
iii Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Groups foreign currency denominated loans are designated as a hedge of the Groups investment in its respective subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of these loans at 31 December 2008 was 365.7m 2007: 224.7m.
A foreign exchange loss of 110.9m 2007: loss of 3.2m was recognised in the translation reserve in equity on translation of these loans to sterling.
iv Sensitivity It is estimated that a general increase of ten percentage points in the value of sterling against the dollar the main currency impacting the Group would have decreased the Groups profit before tax for 2008 by approximately 10.8m 2007: 7.3m at a ten percentage point increase and 0.8m at a one percentage point increase.
A ten percentage point increase has been used in the current year compared to a one percentage point increase in the prior year accounts sensitivity analysis to reflect the current economic environment.
The forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
e Fair values The table below sets out a comparison of the book values and corresponding fair values of all the Groups financial instruments by class.
com Notes to the financial statements 28 Financial instruments continued f Estimation of fair values The major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the Groups financial instruments are summarised below.
i Interest rate swaps and caps used for hedging Bank valuations are used to estimate the fair value of interest rate swaps and caps used for hedging.
Valuations are tested by considering the equivalent swap rate as at 31 December and calculating the difference in interest earned at this rate compared to the original swap rate and cap.
ii Forward exchange contracts The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their quoted market price, if available.
If a quoted market price is not available, the fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate.
iii Interest bearing loans and borrowings The fair value of the floating interest bearing loans and borrowings is equal to the book value, since the floating interest rates were reset just prior to the year end.
The fair value of the fixed rate interest bearing loans and borrowings has been calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate at the reporting date.
iv Trade receivables and payables For trade receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All others are estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
v Available-for-sale financial assets The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date.
vi Interest rates used for determining fair value Prevailing market interest rates at the reporting date are used to discount future cash flows to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
29 Contingent liabilities 2008 2007 m m Guarantees, letters of credit and performance bonds 8.9 7.1 Litigation From time to time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business, including claims for damages, negligence and commercial disputes regarding inspection and testing and disputes with employees and former employees.
The Group is not currently party to any legal proceedings other than ordinary litigation incidental to the conduct of business.
The outcome of litigation to which the Intertek Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen as in some cases the facts are unclear or further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case.
However, based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
Tax The Group operates in more than 100 countries and is subject to wide range of complex tax laws and regulations.
At any point in time it is normal for there to be a number of open years in any particular territory which may be subject to enquiry by local authorities.
Where the effect of the laws and regulations is unclear, estimates are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid on past profits which are recognised in the financial statements.
