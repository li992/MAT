Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly, the Groups tax charge will continue to depend on the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of 155 million 2007: 131 million that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group.
