The City of London Investment Trust plc Report & Accounts 2008 49 Notes to the Accounts continued 23 VAT on management fees In 2004 the Association of Investment Companies the AIC, together with JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust plc, launched a case against HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to challenge whether Value Added Tax VAT should be charged on fees paid for management services provided to investment trust companies.
On 28 June 2007 the European Court of Justice delivered its judgment on the case in favour of the AIC.
Since then, HMRC has accepted that the provision of investment management services to investment trust companies is VAT exempt and has acknowledged its liability to pay claims in respect of VAT borne by investment companies.
The Manager Henderson Global Investors Limited has submitted reclaims to HMRC for the amount of VAT charged to the Company in respect of investment management services from 1 October 2000 to 30 June 2007, to the extent that such VAT was paid by the Manager to HMRC.
Accordingly, VAT borne by the Company on investment management fees invoiced in the period from 1 October 2000 to 30 June 2007 has been written back, in accordance with an agreement reached between the Manager and the Company.
An amount of 1,641,000 has been recognised, reflecting the extent to which recovery by the Company is considered to be virtually certain.
The write back has been allocated between revenue return and capital return according to the allocation of the amounts originally paid.
The Company may be able to recover further amounts of the VAT charged on investment management fees back to 1990, in particular in respect of the period from 1 January 1990 to 4 December 1996 following the decision of the House of Lords in the Fleming Conde Nast case.
However, the Board considers that currently there are too many uncertainties for any reasonable estimate to be calculated of the amounts potentially recoverable during that period.
The Company will receive from the Manager any interest paid by HMRC on the amounts eventually recovered.
VAT has not been applied to investment management fees invoiced since June 2007.
