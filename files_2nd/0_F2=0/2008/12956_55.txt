For ounces delivered into hedges the net cash proceeds from the sales will be limited to the forward price per the contract as per the previous table.
However, the revenue recognised under IFRS in respect of forecast sales using forward contracts rolled forward in 2007 will be adjusted to exclude the non-cash profit loss rolled forward.
These profits losses have already been recognised in the income statement, at the original designated delivery date.

Long term receivables are discounted using the effective interest rate which approximates to a market related rate.
The rates used and the fair values are stated in Note 7.
Long term borrowings The fair value of market-based floating rate long term debt is estimated using the expected future payments discounted at market interest rates.
The fair value for the loans from minority shareholders is based on estimated project cash flows which have been discounted at 3.5% 2007: 6.75%.
Gold price contracts The fair value of gold price forward sales contracts has been determined by reference to quoted market rates at year end balance sheet dates.
The forward price of gold is sensitive to fluctuations in the gold spot price, interest rates and the gold lease rate.
The following table sets forth a sensitivity analysis of the mark-to-market valuations of our hedges as at 31 December 2008: Impact on mark-to-market valuation of financial liabilities - forward gold sales Sensitivity to change in gold price at 31 December 2008 Loulo 100% : Change in US$ gold price 20 10 5 2 0 2 5 10 20 Mark-to-market US$ million 55.5 54.3 53.7 53.4 53.1 52.9 52.6 52.0 50.8 Sensitivity to change in average US$ interest rate at 31 December 2008 Loulo 100% : Change in rate 1.00% 0.50% 0.20% 0.00% -0.20% -0.50% -1.00% Mark-to-market US$ million 54.3 53.7 53.4 53.1 52.9 52.6 52.0 Sensitivity to changes in gold lease rate at 31 December 2008 Loulo 100% : Change in rate 1.00% 0.50% 0.20% 0.00% -0.20% -0.50% -1.00% Mark-to-market US$ million 52.6 52.9 53.0 53.1 53.2 53.4 53.7 These movements will affect profits when the relevant forward contracts expire.
