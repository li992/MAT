Financial instruments The Company is exposed to liquidity, interest rate, credit and capital risks and adopts the same approach to the management of these risks as the Group, as detailed in Note 29.
The Company is not exposed to foreign currency risk as it has no foreign currency assets or liabilities.
Trade and other receivables primarily comprise amounts due from group companies and therefore the Companys exposure to credit risk is limited: none of these assets are overdue or impaired.
The Company hedges its exposure to interest rate risk associated with its 2013 300m 5.25% fixed rate corporate bond as detailed in Notes 20 and 30.
The fair values of both of the Companys corporate bonds are shown in Note 32.
