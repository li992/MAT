Pension contributions The schedule below sets out payments to defined contribution pension schemes on behalf of Executive Directors.
Roger Taylor has a Self Invested Pension Plan: David Goldie and Andrew Harrison have a fixed amount of salary paid into defined contribution pension plans.
Under both schemes, a fixed proportion of salary is paid by the Company together with a fixed proportion by the Executive Director and both amounts are invested on behalf of the Executive Director.
Pension benefits are then funded by the total investment.
Jim Dale had a similar scheme in the Isle of Man.
Levels are reviewed annually against published market data.
None of the Directors was a member of a defined benefit pension scheme during the period.
Pension entitlements are based on basic salary only.
