QXD 5 3 09 10:04 Page 65 Consolidated financial statements Significant accounting policies for the year ended 31 December 2008 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related overheads.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less applicable costs.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been reduced.
For loans and receivables the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of financial assets are reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision for impairment losses.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the provision.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the provision.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance are recognised in the income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement to the extent the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Leased assets a Finance leases Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance lease assets are recognised as assets of the Group at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
Subsequent to recognition, finance lease assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The lease liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease liability.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and the reduction of lease liabilities so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
QXD 9 3 09 15:58 Page 66 Morgan Sindall Report and Accounts 2008 Significant accounting policies for the year ended 31 December 2008 b Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Retirement benefit schemes a Defined contribution plan A defined contribution plan is a post-retirement benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
The Group recognises payments to defined contribution pension plans as staff costs in the income statement as and when they fall due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or reduction on future payments is available.
b Defined benefit plan A defined benefit plan is a post-retirement plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Groups net liability is recognised in the balance sheet and is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods and discounting this to its present value.
Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of the plans assets are deducted.
The calculation of the net liability is performed by a qualified actuary on an annual basis using the projected unit credit method.
The cost of the plan is charged to the income statement based on actuarial assumptions at the beginning of the financial year.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the net of the total unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
When the benefits of the plan are improved, the portion of increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Where the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
Net pension obligations are included in the balance sheet at the present value of the plan liabilities, less the fair value of the plan assets.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and are recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period from the date of grant to the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
Cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date and recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period from the date of grant to the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the payment.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as an employee expense in the income statement.
Fair value is measured by use of a modified Black-Scholes model.
None of these awards when granted was subject to a share price related performance condition.
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments IFRS 2.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
QXD 5 3 09 10:04 Page 67 Consolidated financial statements Significant accounting policies for the year ended 31 December 2008 Financial receivables Certain joint ventures financial receivables are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows directly associated with the financial receivables at a risk-adjusted discount rate.
The change in fair value is recognised in equity to the extent of the Groups equity accounted investment.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments are used in joint ventures to hedge long-term floating interest rate and Retail Prices Index RPI risks.
Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39, interest rate and RPI swaps are stated in the balance sheet at fair value.
At the inception of the hedge relationship the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Where financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and are deemed to be effective, gains and losses on remeasurement relating to the effective portion are recognised in equity and gains and losses on the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement, both to the extent of the Groups equity accounted investment.
Note 28 contains details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedged purposes.
Movements on the hedging reserve in equity are also detailed in note 23.
Dividends Dividends to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.

Segmentation of goodwill and other intangible assets is disclosed in note 1.
Note 24 provides further details in respect of the fair value of intangible assets identified on acquisition and for the determination of goodwill arising on acquisition.
Amortisation charges in respect of intangible assets with a finite life are recorded within administration expenses in the income statement.
The amortisation rates are given in the significant accounting policies.
In testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets in each cash-generating unit has been compared against value in use.
Value in use has been determined by using forecast pre-tax cash flows from approved budgets for the next three years and extrapolating future growth and applying riskadjusted discount rates that are specific to the cash-generating unit in question.
Cash flows beyond three years have been extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2.25%, which is equal to the estimated long-term growth in construction sector GDP.
The risk-adjusted discount rates used are 12% for Construction and Infrastructure Services, 13% for Affordable Housing and 15% for Urban Regeneration.
QXD 9 3 09 14:15 Page 77 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 10 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The key assumptions in forecasting pre-tax cash flows relate to future budgeted revenue, margin likely to be achieved, and likely rates of long-term growth by market sector.
Budgeted revenue and margin are based on views on past performance, secured workload and workload likely to be achievable in the short to medium-term given trends in the relevant market sector as well as macroeconomic factors.
In carrying out this exercise, no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been identified.

The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the Trustees of the Plan.
The total cost charged to the income statement of 8.5m 2007: 6.1m represents contributions payable to the defined contribution section of the Plan by the Group.
As at 31 December 2008, contributions of 0.7m 2007: 0.6m were due in respect of December 2008s contribution not paid over to the Plan.
The Company, with the consent of the Trustees, can decide how to use monies held in a defined contribution general account.
Defined benefit plan defined benefit section compromising liabilities and transfers of funds representing the accrued benefit The Plan includes a rights of active and deferred members and pensioners of pension plans of companies which are now part of the Group.
These include salary related benefits for members in respect of benefits accrued before 31 May 1995 and benefits transferred in from The Snape Group Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme include accruals up to 1 August 1997.
No further defined benefit membership rights can accrue after those dates.
The most recent valuation of the Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit liabilities was as at 31 December 2008.
The present value of the defined benefit liabilities, the related current service cost and past service cost was measured using the projected unit method.
Key assumptions used: 2008 2007 % % Discount rate 6.1 6.0 Expected return on the Plan assets 4.8 5.3 Expected rate of salary increases 4.0 4.5 Future pension increases 3.5 3.5 Inflation increases 3.0 3.5 Life expectancy There is uncertainty around life expectancy of the UK population.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in the UK.
The value of current and future pension benefits will depend on how long they are assumed to be in payment.
For the disclosures as at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007, the PXA92 series of tables from the Continuous Mortality Investigation was adopted appropriate to members actual years of birth and with a medium cohort projection for future improvements in life expectancy.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is as follows: 2008 2007 Male 87.0 86.9 Female 89.8 89.8 The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, twenty years after the balance sheet date is as follows: 2008 2007 Male 88.1 88.0 Female 90.9 90.8 82 83067 Accounts Section1.
QXD 5 3 09 10:05 Page 83 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 17 Retirement benefit schemes continued An increase of one year to the average life expectancy at 65 would increase the present value of the Plan liabilities by around 3.0%.
If such an assumption had been adopted as at 31 December 2008, the present value of the Plan liabilities would have increased to 8.2m 2007: increase of 2.5% with the present value of the Plan liabilities increasing from 8.0m to 8.2m.
The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups liabilities in respect of the Plan is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Present value of the Plan liabilities 8.0 8.0 Fair value of the Plan assets 5.0 4.7 Deficit in the Plan 3.0 3.3 Liability recognised in the balance sheet 3.0 3.3 Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Plan are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Interest cost 0.5 0.4 Expected return on the Plan assets 0.3 0.3 Net periodic cost 0.2 0.1 The charge for the year has been included in administrative expenses.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The actual return on the Plan assets was a loss of 0.1m 2007: gain of 0.3m.
Movements in the present value of the Plan liabilities were as follows: 2008 2007 m m Liabilities at 1 January 8.0 7.3 Interest cost 0.5 0.4 Actuarial gains losses 0.2 0.4 Benefits paid 0.3 0.1 Liabilities at 31 December 8.0 8.0 The liabilities in respect of pensions in payment account for around 16% of the total 2007:17%.
The average term to retirement is six years for active members i. e. members who are still employed by the Group and whose past service benefits are linked to their final salary but are no longer accruing final salary benefits 2007: seven years and three years 2007: five years for deferred members.

Details of the 1995 Scheme and the ESOP 2007 option vesting periods are given in note 22 and the vesting periods for options granted under the 2005 Plan are given in the directors remuneration report on pages 40 to 47.
Under the SAYE scheme, employees are granted an option to purchase shares at up to 20% less than the market price at grant in three years time, depending on their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period.
These funds are used to fund the option exercise price.
The scheme is open to all employees with six months continuous service at the invitation date.
No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of SAYE options.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 9.87 2007: 13.61.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2008 had a weighted average exercise price of 6.04 2007: 6.39, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.1 years 2007: 1.4 years.
In 2008 options under the ESOP 2007 were granted on 15 April, 27 May, 28 October and 26 November and the estimated fair value of the options granted on those dates was 0.3m 2007: 0.6m.
Options and share awards under the 2005 Plan were granted on 9 April 2008 and 16 June 2008.
The estimated fair value of the options granted on those dates was 1.0m 2007: 1.0m and the estimated fair value of the share awards granted on those dates was 0.8m 2007: 0.7m.
The estimated fair value of options granted under the SAYE scheme on 1 July 2008 was 1.2m 2007: nil.
A modified Black-Scholes model has been used to value the options and awards set out below.
None of the options or awards granted was subject to a share price related performance condition.

QXD 5 3 09 10:05 Page 97 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 26 Share-based payments continued Cash-settled share-based payments The Group grants to certain employees share appreciation rights phantoms that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the phantoms to the employee at the date of exercise.
As cash-settled share-based payment awards, the phantoms are revalued at the end of each reporting period.
There were no phantoms granted during the period 2007: nil.
Phantoms are exercisable between three and eight years from the date of grant of the phantom.
The total intrinsic value at 31 December 2008 was 0.2m 2007: 1.0m.
The Group had recorded liabilities of 0.2m at 31 December 2008 in respect of phantoms 2007: 0.8m.
At the reporting date, the fair value and number of phantom awards outstanding was: Balance at Phantom Phantom Balance at Exercise beginning of options options end of Fair value price the year lapsed exercised the year per award Date of grant No.
To the extent that this condition is not expected to be satisfied and the options are expected to lapse, the income statement charge is adjusted.
Similar adjustment is made in the event of a bad leaver.
The fair value of the phantoms was determined by the use of a modified Black-Scholes model using the assumptions noted in the table below: 31 December 2008 31 December 2007 Expected term from date of grant a 4.6-5.6 years 5 years Share price at valuation date 5.42 10.39 Expected volatility of return b 38%-41% 28%-30% Expected dividend yield c 7.4% 2.9% Risk-free rate 2.5% 4.4% a Adjusted from maximum term, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, vesting conditions and behavioural considerations.
b Assumed to be equal to historic volatility of the Companys share price over the period prior to grant equal in length to the expected term.
c Set as equal to dividend yield prevailing at date of grant.
The Group recorded a credit to profit of 0.6m during the year in respect of phantoms 2007: 0.1m expense.

The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
General risk management principles The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
A formal risk assessment and management framework for assessing, monitoring and managing the strategic operational and financial risks of the Group is in place to ensure appropriate risk management of its operations.
Internal control and risk management systems are embedded in the operations of the divisions.
The key business risks identified are discussed in detail in the business review on pages 7 to 8 and the corporate governance statement on pages 50 and 51.
Financial risks and management The Group has exposure to a variety of financial risks through the conduct of its operations.
Risk management is governed by the Groups operational policies, which are subject to periodic review by the Groups internal audit team and twice yearly review by the Board.
The policies include written principles for the Groups risk management as well as specific policies, guidelines and authorisation procedures in respect of specific risk mitigation techniques such as the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The following represent the key financial risks resulting from the Groups use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and results primarily from the Groups trade receivables and amounts recoverable on construction contracts.
Amounts due from construction contract customers and trade receivables The Groups primary exposure to credit risk arises from the potential for non-payment or default from construction contract debtors and trade receivables.
The degree to which the Group is exposed to this credit risk depends on the individual characteristics of the contract counterparty and the nature of the project.
The Groups credit risk is also influenced by general macroeconomic conditions.
The Group primarily operates in one geographical segment, being the United Kingdom.
The Group does not have any significant concentration risk in respect of amounts due from construction contract customers or trade receivables balances at the reporting date with receivables spread across a wide range of customers.
Due to the nature of the Groups operations, it is normal practice for customers to hold retentions in respect of contracts completed.
Retentions held by customers at 31 December 2008 were 59.6m 2007: 66.2m.
The Group manages its exposure to credit risk through the application of its credit risk management policies which specify the minimum requirements in respect of the credit worthiness of potential customers, assessed through reports from credit agencies, and the timing and extent of progress payments in respect of contracts.
The risk management policies of the Group also specify procedures in respect of obtaining parent company guarantees or, in certain circumstances, use of escrow accounts, which in the event of default means that the Group may have a secure claim.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of amounts due from construction contract customers or trade receivables.
