88 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 2 Segment information Our primary reporting segments are geographic.
During 2008 we reorganised the management of our regions so that our operations in Central & Eastern Europe were managed together with those in Asia and Africa, whereas they had previously been managed together with those in Western Europe.
This change reects our strategic focus on the developing world and the fact that these markets share many common characteristics.
As at the end of 2008 our revised structure comprises the three operating regions of Western Europe, The Americas, and Asia, Africa and Central & Eastern Europe AACEE.
We are therefore now reporting segmentally on this revised basis and have restated prior year amounts accordingly.
The home countries of the Unilever Group are the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
Turnover for these two countries combined in 2008 was 3 543 million 2007: 3 768 million: 2006: 3 710 million.

Turnover for the United States for 2008 was 6 606 million 2007: 7 120 million: 2006: 7 627 million.
No other country had turnover of more than 10% of the Group total.
The analysis of turnover by geographical area is stated on the basis of origin.
Turnover on a destination basis would not be materially different.
Inter-segment sales between geographical areas and between product areas as on page 91 are not material.

Corporate assets consist of current and deferred tax and pension assets, cash and cash equivalents, and other current or non-current financial assets.
Segment liabilities consist primarily of trade payables and other liabilities.
Corporate liabilities include financial liabilities, tax balances payable, provisions and pension and deferred tax liabilities.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including additions resulting from acquisitions.
Other non-cash charges include charges to the income statement during the year in respect of share-based compensation, restructuring and other provisions.

They primarily relate to redundancy and retirement costs.
Business disposals generate both costs and revenues which are not reective of underlying performance.
Impairment charges are primarily recognised for goodwill other than where included in restructuring or as part of business disposals.
The gains on US healthcare arose from the introduction of an annual cap on the benets which each participant can claim.
The gain in the UK resulted from reducing deferred pensions where they are taken early.

Earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the revised nominal share values which have been applied since 22 May 2006 and which resulted in a one-to-one equivalence of ordinary shares of NV and PLC as regards their economic interest in the Group.
For further information please refer to note 22 on page 122.
The calculations of diluted earnings per share are based on: i conversion into PLC ordinary shares of the shares in a group company which are convertible in the year 2038, as described in Corporate governance on page 54: and ii the effect of share-based compensation plans, details of which are set out in note 29 on pages 133 to 134.

9 Goodwill and intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inows.
These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support.
Brands that are classied as indefinite have been in the market for many years, and the nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported by advertising and marketing spend.
Finite-lived intangible assets, which primarily comprise patented and non-patented technology, know-how, and software, are capitalised and amortised in operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected useful lives, none of which exceeds ten years.
The level of amortisation for nitelived intangible assets is not expected to change materially over the next five years.

Impairments charge in the year The impairments charged in 2008 principally related to a non-core savoury business in the Americas which was subsequently classied as held for sale.
There were no impairments in 2007. significant CGUs The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets predominantly Knorr and Hellmanns held in the global savoury and dressings CGU, comprising 10.6 billion 2007: 11.1 billion and 3.1 billion 2007: 3.2 billion respectively, are considered significant in comparison to the total carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at 31 December 2008.
No other CGUs are considered significant in this respect.
During 2008, we conducted an impairment review of the carrying value of these assets.
Value in use of the global savoury and dressings CGU has been calculated as the present value of projected future cash ows.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% was used.
The following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash ow projections for the savoury and dressings CGU: a longer-term sustainable growth rate of 4%, adjusted for market fade, used to determine an appropriate terminal value multiple: average near-term nominal growth for the major product groups within the CGU of 6%: and average operating margins for the major product groups within the CGU ranging from 15% to 19%.
The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and our experience of growth rates and margins achievable in our key markets as a guide.
We believe that the assumptions used in estimating the future performance of the savoury and dressings CGU are consistent with past performance.
The projections covered a period of ten years as we believe this to be a suitable timescale over which to review and consider annual performance before applying a xed terminal value multiple to the final year cash ows of the detailed projection.
Stopping the detailed projections after five years and applying a terminal value multiple thereafter would not result in a value in use that would cause impairment.
The growth rates used to estimate future performance beyond the periods covered by our annual planning and strategic planning processes do not exceed the long-term average rates of growth for similar products.
We have performed sensitivity analysis around the base case assumptions and have concluded that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the global savoury and dressings CGU to be less than the carrying amount.

The structure of the newly formed entity is such that there is joint control and it is therefore accounted for by Unilever as a joint venture.
In December 2007 a capital contribution of 103 million was made to Pepsi Lipton International.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1 369 million and tax credits amounting to 307 million available for offset against future taxable profits.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of 1 019 million and tax credits of 307 million, as it is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses can be utilised.
The majority of these tax losses and credits arise in tax jurisdictions where they do not expire with the exception of 457 million of state and federal tax losses in the US which expire between now and 2028.
Other deductible temporary differences of 133 million have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
There is no expiry date for these differences.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 967 million 2007: 1 059 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Groups customer base being large and diverse.
Our historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low across territories and so trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets.
Other receivables comprise loans and receivables of 258 million 2007: 362 million and other non-financial assets of 397 million 2007: 400 million.
We do not consider the fair values of trade and other receivables to be signicantly different from their carrying values.
Balances are considered for impairment on an individual basis rather than by reference to the extent that they become overdue.

The 4%, 6% and 7% cumulative preference shares of NV are entitled to dividends at the rates indicated.
The 4% preference capital of NV is redeemable at par at the companys option either wholly or in part.
The other classes of preferential share capital of NV are not unilaterally redeemable by the company.
At the Annual General Meeting of NV held on 8 May 2006 it was agreed to convert the nominal value of all classes of shares from guilders into euros.
The 7% and 6% preference shares with a nominal value of Fl.
1 000 each, were converted into shares with a nominal value of 428.57 each, and the 4% preference shares with a nominal value of Fl.
100 each, were converted into shares with a nominal value of 42.86 each.
The effect of this conversion was to adjust their reported value, with the difference being held as a statutory reserve.
In order to maintain the same economic rights for the preference shares as before the euro conversion, it was decided that their entitlement to dividend and liquidation proceeds remains linked, using the ofcial euro conversion rate, to the amount in Dutch guilders originally paid up on these shares.
The euro conversion did not alter the dividend entitlements of the cumulative preference shares.

Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 107 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 17 Financial instruments and treasury risk management Turmoil in financial markets: impact on Treasury We believe our strong single-A rating and active financial management have served us well in the current financial turmoil.
Maintaining our strong single-A rating has been and will remain a key priority.
To cope with the impact of the financial crisis, we undertook, amongst others, the following actions: Liquidity management: In order to reduce our renance risk, we actively structured out our commercial paper maturity prole: Throughout the year we had good access to commercial paper markets particularly in the US at significant discounts to Libor : During the calendar year we completed three bond issues, for a total amount of 1.4 billion, all at competitive rates: and As the business successfully managed year-end working capital positions, Unilever closed the year with a cash balance of around 2.6 billion, including 0.6 billion from proceeds of disposal of the Bertolli olive oil business received at the year end.
Counterparty exposures: We regularly reviewed and tightened counterparty limits.
Banking exposures were actively monitored on a daily basis.
During the year we reduced the maturity prole of our deposits to an overnight basis providing maximum exibility.
Unilever benets from collateral agreements with our principal banks see also page 110 based on which banks need to deposit securities and or cash as collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
Unilever did not encounter any material counterparty exposure loss from financial institutions during 2008.
Funding costs: In general, credit spreads have increased signicantly and are very volatile.
This over time will lead to increased funding costs.
During 2008 we were able to issue commercial paper and bonds at competitive rates.
Bank facility renewal: Our bank facilities are renewed annually.
On 31 December 2008 we had US $6 205 million of undrawn committed facilities.
As at 1 January 2009 the amount of undrawn committed facilities will be US $5 950 million, to be renewed in October 2009.
For further details, see Liquidity risk' section below.
Treasury Risk Management Unilever manages a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity and counterparty risks.
Currency risks Because of Unilevers broad operational reach, it is subject to risks from changes in foreign currency values that could affect earnings.
As a practical matter, it is not feasible to fully hedge these uctuations.
Unilever does have a foreign exchange policy that requires operating companies to manage trading and financial foreign exchange exposures within prescribed limits.
This is achieved primarily through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
On a case-by-case basis, depending on potential income statement volatility that can be caused by the fair value movement of the derivative, companies decide whether or not to apply cash ow hedge accounting.
Regional groups monitor compliance with this foreign exchange policy.
At the end of 2008, there was no material exposure from companies holding assets and liabilities other than in their functional currency.
In addition, as Unilever conducts business in many foreign currencies but publishes its financial statements and measures its performance in euros, it is subject to exchange risk due to the effects that exchange rate movements have on the translation of the underlying net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
Unilever aims to minimise its foreign exchange exposure in operating companies by borrowing in the local currency, except where inhibited by local regulations, lack of local liquidity or local market conditions.
For those countries that in the view of management have a substantial retranslation risk, Unilever may decide on a case-by-case basis, taking into account amongst other factors the impact on the income statement, to hedge such net investment.
This is achieved through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts on which hedge accounting is applied.
Nevertheless, from time to time, currency revaluations on unhedged investments will trigger exchange translation movements in the balance sheet.
Interest rate risks Unilever has an interest rate management policy aimed at achieving an optimal balance between xed and oating rate interest rate exposures on expected net debt gross borrowings minus cash and cash equivalents levels for the next five calendar years.
The objective of the policy is to minimise annual interest costs and to reduce volatility.
This is achieved by issuing xed rate long-term debt and by modifying the interest rate exposure of debt and cash positions through the use of interest rate swaps.
The xing levels per calendar year are determined by xing bands, with minimum and maximum xing level percentages, decreasing by 10 percentage points per calendar year.
The minimum level in the first year amounts to 50% and the maximum level amounts to 90%.
The minimum level is set to avoid unacceptable interest cost volatility and the maximum level is set to prevent over-xing, recognising that future debt levels can be volatile.
At the end of 2008, interest rates were xed on approximately 56% of the projected net of cash and financial liability positions for 2009 and 51% for 2010 compared with 68% for 2008 and 53% for 2009 at the end of 2007.
108 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 17 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued Liquidity risk A material and sustained shortfall in our cash ow could undermine our credit rating and overall investor confidence and could restrict the Groups ability to raise funds.
Operational cash ow provides the funds to service the nancing of financial liabilities and enhance shareholder return.
Unilever manages the liquidity requirements by the use of short-term and long-term cash ow forecasts.
Unilever maintains access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short-term and long-term debt programmes.
In addition to this, Unilever has committed credit facilities in place to support its commercial paper programmes and for general corporate purposes.
During 2008 we made no use of the committed facilities.
Unilever had US $6 205 million of undrawn committed facilities on 31 December 2008 as follows: revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities of in aggregate US $4 230 million 2007: US $3 630 million out of which US $3 675 million 2007: US $3 630 million with a 364-day term out: revolving 364-day notes commitments of US $200 million 2007: US $200 million with the ability to issue notes with a maturity up to 364 days: and 364-day bilateral money market commitments of in aggregate US $1 775 million 2007: US $1 720 million, under which the underwriting banks agree, subject to certain conditions, to subscribe for notes with maturities of up to three years.
As from 1 January 2009 the amount of undrawn committed facilities will be US $5 950 million.
As part of the regular annual process these facilities will be renewed in October 2009.
The financial market turbulence and associated illiquidity in credit markets during the second half of 2007 and throughout 2008 did not impact Unilevers ability to meet its nancing requirements.

Credit risk on banks and received collateral Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a group basis.
This risk arises from transactions with banks like cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
To reduce the credit risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited group of banks that have secure credit ratings.
Per bank, individual risk limits are set based on its financial position, credit ratings, past experience and other factors.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
To reduce the credit exposures, netting agreements are in place with Unilevers principal banks that allow Unilever, in case of a default, to net assets and liabilities across transactions.
To further reduce Unilevers credit exposures, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilevers principal banks based on which they need to deposit securities and or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
At 31 December 2008 the collateral received by Unilever amounted to 369 million 2007: nil, of which 112 million was cash and the fair value of the bond securities amounted to 257 million.
Although contractually Unilever has the right to sell or repledge the collateral, it has no intention to do so.
As a consequence, the non-cash collateral has not been recognised as an asset in our balance sheet.
Derivative financial instruments The Group has comprehensive policies in place, approved by the Boards, covering the use of derivative financial instruments.
These instruments are used for hedging purposes.
The Group has an established system of control in place covering all financial instruments: including policies, guidelines, exposure limits, a system of authorities and independent reporting, that is subject to periodic review by internal audit.
Hedge accounting principles are described in note 1 on page 86.
The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.
In the assessment of hedge effectiveness the credit risk element on the underlying hedged item has been excluded.
The Group uses the following types of hedges: cash ow hedges used to hedge the risk on future foreign currency cash ows, oating interest rate cash ows, and the price risk on future purchases of raw materials: fair value hedges used to convert the xed interest rate on financial liabilities into a oating interest rate: net investment hedges used to hedge the investment value of our foreign subsidiaries: and natural hedges used to hedge the risk on exposures that are on the balance sheet.
No hedge accounting is applied.
Details of the various types of hedges are given below.
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts represent the gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts at the year-end forward exchange rates.
The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ows.

The impact of exchange rate movements on the fair value of forward exchange contracts used to hedge net investments is recognised in reserves.
Natural hedges A natural hedge sometimes known as an economic hedge is where exposure to a risk is offset, or partly offset, by an opposite exposure to that same risk.
Hedge accounting is not applied to these relationships.
The following table shows the fair value of derivatives outstanding at year end that are natural hedges.

The remaining balances are shown under trade and other receivables and other liabilities.
Sensitivity to not applying hedge accounting Derivatives have to be reported at fair value.
Those derivatives used for cash ow hedging and net investment hedging for which we do not apply hedge accounting will cause volatility in the income statement.
Such derivatives did not have a material impact on the 2008 income statement.
Embedded derivatives In accordance with IAS 39, 'Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement', Unilever has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet specic requirements set out in the standard: no material embedded derivatives have been identied.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table summarises the fair values and carrying amounts of the various classes of financial assets and financial liabilities.
All trade and other receivables and trade payables and other liabilities have been excluded from the analysis below and from the interest rate and currency proles in note 15 on page 104 and note 16 on page 107, as their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of their fair value, because of their short-term nature.

Cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets, bank loans and overdrafts have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts because of their short-term nature.
The fair values of listed bonds are based on their market value: non-listed bonds and other loans are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ows associated with these instruments.
Fair values for finance lease creditors have been assessed by reference to current market rates for comparable leasing arrangements.
Commodity contracts The Group uses commodity forward contracts and futures to hedge against price risk in certain commodities.
All commodity forward contracts and futures hedge future purchases of raw materials.
Settlement of these contracts will be in cash or by physical delivery.
Those contracts that will be settled in cash are reported in the balance sheet at fair value and, to the extent that they are considered as an effective hedge under IAS 39, fair value movements are recognised in the cash ow reserve.
112 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 17 Financial instruments and treasury risk management continued Capital management The Groups financial strategy supports Unilevers aim to be in the top third of a reference group including 20 other international consumer goods companies for Total Shareholder Return, as explained on page 43.
The key elements of the financial strategy are: appropriate access to equity and debt markets: sufficient exibility for acquisitions that we fund out of current cash ows: A A1 long-term credit rating: A1 P1 short-term credit rating: sufficient resilience against economic and financial turmoil: and optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the constraints above.
For the A1 P1 short-term credit rating the company monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies.
This information is publicly available and is updated by the credit rating agencies on a regular basis.
The capital structure of Unilever is based on managements judgement of the appropriate balancing of all key elements of its financial strategy in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs.
We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure and make adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
Unilever will take appropriate steps in order to maintain, or if necessary adjust, the capital structure.
Annually the overall funding plan is presented to the Board for approval.
Return on Invested Capital continues to be one of Unilever's key performance measures.
Within this denition we have dened the components of our Invested Capital.
See page 42 for the details of this denition and the calculation of Unilever's Return on Invested Capital.
Unilever is not subject to covenants in any of its significant nancing agreements.
Income statement sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates The values of debt, investments and related hedging instruments, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities holding them, are subject to exchange rate movements.
The translation risk on the foreign exchange debtors and creditors is excluded from this sensitivity analysis as the risk is considered to be immaterial because positions will remain within prescribed limits see currency risks on page 108.
The remaining foreign exchange positions at 31 December 2008 mainly relate to unhedged US $ loans total amount at 31 December 2008 US $65 million.
A reasonably possible 10% change in rates would lead to a 5 million movement in the income statement 2007: 7 million, based on a linear calculation of our exposure.
Income statement sensitivity to changes in interest rate Interest rate risks are presented by way of sensitivity analysis.
As described on page 108, Unilever has an interest rate management policy aimed at optimising net interest cost and reducing volatility in the income statement.
As part of this policy, part of the funds debt have xed interest rates and are no longer exposed to changes in the oating rates.
The remaining oating part of our funds debt see interest rate prole tables on pages 104 for the assets and 107 for the liabilities is exposed to changes in the oating interest rates.
The analysis below shows the sensitivity of the income statement to a reasonably possible one percentage point change in oating interest rates on a full-year basis.
Sensitivity to a reasonably possible one percentage point change in oating rates as at 31 December million million 2008 2007 Funds 77 25 Debt 105 55 Net investment hedges: sensitivity relating to changes in foreign exchange rates To reduce the retranslation risk of Unilever's investments in foreign subsidiaries, Unilever uses net investment hedges.
The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements and changes in these fair values are recognised directly in equity and will offset the retranslation impact of the related subsidiary.
At 31 December 2008 the nominal value of these net investment hedges amounts to 5.1 billion 2007: 7.5 billion mainly consisting of US$ contracts.
A reasonably possible 10% change in rates would lead to a fair value movement of 513 million 2007: 750 million.
This movement would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the book equity of the foreign subsidiary.
Cash ow hedges: sensitivity relating to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates Unilever uses on a limited scale both interest rate and forex cash ow hedges.
The fair values of these instruments are subject to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
Because of the limited use of these instruments and the amount of Unilever's equity, possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates will not lead to fair value movements that will have a material impact on Unilever's equity.

Legal provisions are comprised of many claims, of which none is individually material.
Further information is given in note 25 on page 126.
The provision for disputed indirect taxes is comprised of a number of small disputed items.
The largest elements of the provision relate to disputes with the Brazilian authorities.
Because of the nature of the disputes, the timing of the utilisation of the provisions, and any associated cash outows, is uncertain.
The majority of the disputed items attract an interest charge.
For further information please refer to note 25 on page 127.
No individual item within the other provisions balance is significant.
Unilever expects that the issues relating to these restructuring, legal and other provisions will be substantively resolved over the next five years.
114 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 20 Pensions and similar obligations Description of plans In many countries the Group operates dened benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of these plans are externally funded.
The Group also provides other post-employment benets, mainly post-employment healthcare plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
The Group also operates a number of dened contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
The majority of the Groups externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities.
The operation of these entities is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees or equivalent and their composition.
Exposure to risks Pension assets and liabilities pre-tax of 11 719 million and 15 101 million respectively are held on the Groups balance sheet as at 31 December 2008.
Movements in equity markets, interest rates, ination and life expectancy could materially affect the level of surpluses and deficits in these schemes, and could prompt the need for the Group to make additional pension contributions, or to reduce pension contributions, in the future.
The key assumptions used to value our pension liabilities are set out below and on pages 116 and 117.
Investment strategy The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded pension plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benets provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversied, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans invest the largest proportion of the assets in equities which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
The pension funds also have a proportion of assets invested in property, bonds, hedge funds and cash.
The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house.
Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle Univest which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplied externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for equities and hedge funds.
The aim is to provide a high quality, well diversied, risk-controlled vehicle.
Assumptions With the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal dened benefit pension plans which cover approximately 95% of total pension liabilities and plans providing other post-employment benets and in addition the expected long-term rates of return on assets, weighted by asset value.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effect: million million 1% point 1% point increase decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components 2 2 Effect on total benefit obligation 18 17 The expected rates of return on plan assets were determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rates of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and applies to these rates suitable risk premiums that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.
The assumptions made in 2008 are consistent with those applied in 2007.
Mortality assumptions for the most important countries are based on the following post-retirement mortality tables: i United Kingdom: PNMA 00 and PNFA 00 with medium cohort adjustment subject to a minimum annual improvement of 1% and scaling factors of 110% for current male pensioners, 125% for current female pensioners and 105% for future male and female pensioners: ii the Netherlands: GBMV 20002005 with age set back of four years for males and two years for females: iii United States: RP2000 with a projection period of 1015 years: and iv Germany: Heubeck 1998 Periodentafel with a scaling factor of 85%.
These tables translate into the following years of life expectancy for current pensioners aged 65: United United Kingdom Netherlands States Germany Males 21 20 19 18 Females 23 22 22 21 With regard to future improvements in life expectancy, in the UK for example, males and females currently aged 45 are assumed to have a life expectancy of 24 years and 26 years respectively on retirement at age 65.
Assumptions for the remaining dened benefit plans vary considerably, depending on the economic conditions of the countries where they are situated.

The constituents of the Principal plans and Other plans were reviewed in both 2006 and 2007, such that some Other plans were moved into Principal plans in 2006 and a smaller number of plans were moved out of Principal plans into Other plans in 2007.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 117 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 20 Pensions and similar obligations continued During 2008 some previously unfunded liabilities were funded utilising existing surpluses.
As a consequence of this the liabilities of 24 million were moved from unfunded to funded in the table above.
In 2007, a contractual trust arrangement was established in Germany to partially fund previously unfunded pension liabilities.
The initial funding was 300 million whilst the value of the previously unfunded liabilities at 1 January 2007 was approximately 850 million.
As a consequence of this funding, the liabilities have been transferred from unfunded to funded in the table above.
Equity securities include Unilever securities amounting to 25 million 0.2% of total plan assets and 32 million 0.2% of total plan assets at 31 December 2008 and 2007 respectively.
Property includes property occupied by Unilever amounting to 57 million and 69 million at 31 December 2008 and 2007 respectively.
The pension assets above exclude the assets in a Special Benets Trust amounting to 146 million 2007: 162 million to fund pension and similar obligations in the US see also note 11 on page 101.

During 2006 a number of initiatives were taken to reduce the cost of post-employment healthcare benets, principally in the United States, through changes to the design of the plans.
As a consequence, a reduction in liability of 146 million was recognised in the income statement for 2006.
Cash ow Group cash ow in respect of pensions and similar post employment benets comprises company contributions paid to funded plans and benets paid by the company in respect of unfunded plans.
In 2008, the benets paid in respect of unfunded plans amounted to 223 million 2007: 280 million: 2006: 333 million.
Company contributions to funded dened benefit plans are subject to periodic review, taking account of local legislation.
In 2008, contributions to funded dened benefit plans including funding of previously unfunded benets amounted to 531 million 2007: 878 million: 2006: 758 million.
This includes a sum of 254 million to the UK pension plan in expectation of a transfer of unfunded liabilities to the plan in 2009.
Contributions to dened contribution plans including 401k plans amounted to 55 million 2007: 52 million: 2006: 61 million.
In 2008 a 42 million refund was received from the Danish pension plan following action to externally insure the liabilities.
In 2007, a 50 million refund of assets was received out of recognised surplus from Finland.
Total contributions by the Group to funded plans, net of refunds, are currently expected to be about 700 million in 2009 2008 actual: 531 million.
benefit payments by the Group in respect of unfunded plans are currently expected to be about 230 million in 2009 2008 actual: 223 million.

Internal holdings The ordinary shares numbered 1 to 2 400 inclusive in NV Special Shares and deferred stock of PLC are held as to one half of each class by N. V. Elma a subsidiary of NV and one half by United Holdings Limited a subsidiary of PLC.
This capital is eliminated on consolidation.
For information on the rights related to the aforementioned ordinary shares, see Corporate Governance on pages 50 and 51.
The subsidiaries mentioned above have waived their rights to dividends on their ordinary shares in NV.
Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans involving options and awards of ordinary shares of NV and PLC.

b The share-based compensation credit relates to the reversal of the non-cash charge recorded against operating profit in respect of the fair value of share options and awards granted to employees.
c As part of the review of Unilever's corporate structure, and in the light of the constitutional and operational arrangements which enable Unilever N. V. and Unilever PLC to operate as nearly as practicable as a single company, the Directors have been authorised to take any action necessary or desirable in order to ensure that the ratio of the dividend generating capacity of PLC to that of NV does not differ substantially from the ratio of the dividend entitlement of ordinary shareholders in PLC to that of ordinary shareholders in NV.
During 2007, Unilevers shareholding in Unilever Jernimo Martins in Portugal was transferred from NV to PLC for no consideration.
In addition, a part of indirect shareholdings in Unilever US was sold by NV to PLC and the fair value economic swap in South Africa led to further adjustments between NV and PLC.
In 2006, shareholdings in the Unilever companies in Czech Republic, Hungary, Russia and Turkey, as well as a part of indirect shareholdings in Unilever US, were transferred from NV to PLC for no consideration.
In addition, part of a dividend which would otherwise be due from a Unilever US intermediate company to a company within the NV part of the Group was instead paid to a company within the PLC part of the Group.
In 2008 shareholdings in the Unilever companies in Belgium, Austria, Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland were transferred to 100% NV ownership.
In addition, shareholdings in Canada and Indonesia were re-aligned between NV and PLC.
Reorganisations of group companies have produced similar types of adjustments in previous years.
Cumulative goodwill written off directly to reserves prior to the transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 was 5 199 million for NV and 2 063 million for PLC.

Future minimum sublease payments of 66 million are expected to be received.
Other commitments principally comprise commitments under contracts to purchase materials and services.
They do not include commitments for capital expenditure, which are reported in note 10 on page 99.
Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benets, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benets.
It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will result in an obligation in the future.
The Group does not believe that any of these contingent liabilities will result in a material loss.
Contingent liabilities arise in respect of litigation against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and scal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation.
The estimated total of such contingent liabilities at 31 December 2008 was some 355 million 2007: 430 million.
Contingent liabilities also arise from guarantees issued by group companies.
At 31 December 2008 these amounted to some 45 million 2007: 81 million.
Included in this were discounted trade bills with a value of 1 million 2007: 4 million.
We believe that any loss arising in connection with these would not have a material effect on the Groups financial condition or results of operations.
Guarantees given by parent or group companies that relate to liabilities already included in these consolidated accounts are excluded from this total.
The total value of guarantees which arose or were revised in 2008 was 4 million 2007: 4 million.
The fair value of guarantees is not material in either 2008 or 2007.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 125 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 25 Commitments and contingent liabilities continued Legal proceedings We are involved from time to time in legal and arbitration proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
However, although the outcome of legal proceedings are inherently difficult to predict, we are currently not involved in any legal or arbitration proceedings which may be expected to lead to material loss or expenditure in the context of the Group results.
Similarly we do not have any material obligations under environmental legislation.
None of our Directors or Ofcers is involved in any legal proceedings which are material as aforesaid.
The following are the most significant legal proceedings in which the group is currently involved.
Ice cream cases As previously reported, in 2006 the European Court of Justice ruled to dismiss the appeal by Unilevers Irish ice cream business, HB Ice Cream, of a 2003 Court of First Instance judgment that upheld the European Commissions 1998 decision to ban HB Ice Cream from imposing cabinet exclusivity in Ireland in circumstances where Unilever cabinets were the only cabinets used by the retailer.
Although this final ruling related to a Commission decision that applied to Ireland only, Mars subsequently sought to bring legal claims against Unilever before the courts and to lodge complaints with the competition authorities in a number of European countries in the course of 2007.
In April 2008 Mars and Unilever reached an agreement to settle out of court their differences in respect of distribution arrangements for the sale of Unilever's impulse ice cream.
Neither the talks themselves nor any resulting settlement imply any admission of liability on Unilever's part.
The payment to be made by Unilever to Mars under the terms of the settlement has been fully provided for.
As regards investigations previously instituted by national competition authorities, the Portuguese competition authority confirmed in 2008 that it had closed its investigation into Unilevers Portuguese ice cream business, subject to certain monitoring obligations that will apply for three years.
In Italy, a 2007 ruling by the Consiglio di Stato overturned the 2003 decision of the Italian competition authority ICA that responded positively to a notication by Unilever of its policy in relation to outlet exclusivity.
The Consiglio di Stato took the view that Unilevers market position in Italy had not been sufciently investigated by the ICA.
To the extent that the ICA decides to reinvestigate the matter, Unilever will engage proactively with the authority with a view to securing a prompt resolution to any outstanding issues.
Other competition issues As previously reported, in 2006 the French competition authorities commenced an inquiry into potential competition law infringements in France involving a number of consumer goods companies in the home and personal care sector, including Unilever France and Lever Faberg France, both subsidiaries of the Unilever Group.
Interviews have been conducted with present and former members of our staff and documents have been supplied to the French authorities.
No Statement of Objections or proposals for fines have yet been lodged against either Unilever France or Lever Faberg France as the authorities investigation has had to be restarted following procedural challenge.
Accordingly, the potential financial implications, if any, of this investigation cannot yet be assessed.
A Statement of Objections is, however, expected in the near future.
By a decision dated 19 February 2008, the German Federal Cartel Ofce imposed a ne on Unilever in relation to anti competitive behaviour in the toothpaste market in Germany.
Unilever lodged an appeal against that decision on 29 February 2008.
However, in light of a revised decision reducing the fines to be imposed upon Unilever, the appeal was withdrawn by Unilever on 9 October 2008.
On 25 February 2008, a purported class action lawsuit was led in the United States of America in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging, relying upon the German investigation described above, that Unilever N. V. Unilever PLC and Unilever United States, Inc. allegedly conspired with certain other companies to x prices of oral, home and personal care products in the United States.
On 18 December 2008, the trial court issued an opinion dismissing all claims in the case for lack of jurisdiction.
In April 2008, Unilever received a notice from the UK Ofce of Fair Trading requiring the production of documents in relation to an investigation into potential co ordination of the retail prices of certain products in the grocery sector.
A response to the notice was provided in June 2008.
It is too early to gauge whether the investigation to which the notice relates will lead to a Statement of Objections being addressed to Unilever or its subsidiaries.
In June 2008, Unilever premises in Austria, Belgium, Italy, The Netherlands and Spain were the subject of unannounced inspections by the European Commission and or national competition authorities.
The inspections were in relation to the home care and or personal care markets.
Requests for information from the European Commission relating to alleged anti competitive behaviour in detergents markets in the EEA were subsequently received by Unilever in July 2008 and December 2008.
Responses were provided in October 2008 and January 2009, respectively.
Separately, a request for information relating to alleged anti competitive behaviour in personal care markets in The Netherlands was received by Unilever from the Dutch Competition Authority in November and a response led in December 2008.
It is too early to gauge whether the investigations that have been initiated will lead to Statements of Objections being addressed to Unilever or its subsidiaries.
In late 2008 Unilever Greece attended hearings before the Greek Competion Authority in relation to an alleged violation of competition rules deriving from a term previously included in its contracts with a limited number of retailers in the period 2000 to 2002 in relation to parallel imports.
As from 2003 Unilever Greece had voluntarily removed the relevant term from its contracts.
A decision in this case is expected in March 2009.
It is Unilevers policy to co-operate fully with the competition authorities in the context of all ongoing investigations.
126 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 25 Commitments and contingent liabilities continued Tax cases Brazil During 2004 the Federal Supreme Court in Brazil local acronym STF announced a review of certain cases that it had previously decided in favour of taxpayers.
Because of this action, we established a provision in 2004 for the potential repayment of sales tax credits in the event that the cases establishing precedents in our favour are reversed.
Since that time we continue to monitor the situation and have made changes as appropriate to the amount provided.
In June 2007, the Supreme Court ruled against the taxpayers in one of these cases.
Industry associations of which Unilever is a member attempted to negotiate a settlement with the Federal Revenue Service to reduce or avoid the payment of interest and or penalties on such amounts.
On 3 December 2008 the negotiations resulted in the publication of a settlement by the Brazilian government, open to all taxpayers including Unilever.
The amount payable based on this offer does not result in additional liabilities beyond those already accounted for.
Also during 2004 in Brazil, and in common with many other businesses operating in that country, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice of infringement from the Federal Revenue Service.
The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was undertaken without valid business purpose.
The dispute is in court and if upheld, will result in a tax payment relating to years from 2001 to the present day.
The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructurings done by many companies in Brazil.
We believe that the likelihood of a successful challenge by the tax authorities is remote.
While this view is supported by the opinion of outside counsel there can be no guarantee of success in court.
Cumulative preference shares In November 2006 NV announced that it had agreed a settlement with the main parties in a legal dispute over the conversion of the cumulative preference shares that were issued in 1999 as an alternative to a cash dividend.
These cumulative preference shares were converted into ordinary shares in 2005 and subsequently cancelled following approval from the Annual General Meeting in 2005.
Former cumulative preference shareholders who held these shares at the opening of trading on 24 March 2004 were entitled to participate in the settlement.
A group of former cumulative preference shareholders who had bought their preference shares after 24 March 2004 and who are not entitled to the settlement, instituted claims with the Rotterdam District Court for nullification of the NV Boards decision to convert the preference shares and NVs Annual General Meeting decision to cancel the preference shares.
The Rotterdam District Court has not yet decided on the merits of these claims.
The claims are contested vigorously by Unilever NV.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 127 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 26 Acquisitions and disposals 2008 With effect from 1 January 2008, we entered into an expanded international partnership with Pepsico for the marketing and distribution of ready-to-drink tea products under the Lipton brand.
On 3 January 2008 we completed the sale of the Boursin brand to Le Groupe Bel for 400 million.
The turnover of this brand in 2007 was approximately 100 million.
On 2 April 2008 we completed the acquisition of Inmarko, the leading Russian ice cream company.
The company had a turnover in 2007 of approximately 115 million.
On 31 July 2008 we completed the sale of our Lawrys and Adolphs branded seasoning blends and marinades business in the US and Canada to McCormick & Company, Incorporated for 410 million.
The combined annual turnover of the business in 2007 was approximately 100 million.
On 9 September 2008 we completed the sale of our North American laundry business in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico to Vestar Capital Partners, a leading global private equity rm, for consideration of approximately US $1.45 billion, consisting mainly of cash, along with preferred shares and warrants.
These businesses had a combined turnover in 2007 of approximately US $1.0 billion.
On 5 November 2008 we completed the sale of Komili, our olive oil brand in Turkey, to Ana Gida, part of the Anadolu Group.
On 4 December 2008 we completed the sale of our edible oil business in Cte dIvoire, together with its interests in local oil palm plantations Palmci and PHCI, to SIFCA, the parent company of an Ivorian agro-industry group, and to a 50:50 joint venture between two Singapore-based companies, Wilmar International Limited and Olam International Limited.
At the same time we acquired the soap business of Cosmivoire, a subsidiary of SIFCA.
On 23 December 2008 we completed the disposal of our Bertolli olive oil and vinegar business to Grupo SOS for a consideration of 630 million.
The transaction was structured as a worldwide perpetual licence by Unilever of the Bertolli brand in respect of olive oil and premium vinegar.
The transaction included the sale of the Italian Maya, Dante and San Giorgio olive oil and seed oil businesses, as well as the factory at Inveruno, Italy.
2007 During 2007 we purchased minority interests in subsidiary companies in Greece and India.
We invested in a new venture fund, Physic Ventures, which is accounted for as an associate, and made additional investments in two other venture companies, Spa and Salon International Limited and Langholm Capital, both of which are accounted for as associates.
With effect from 1 October 2007, Unilever and Remgro Ltd. reached agreement to reorganise their respective shareholdings in the Unilever businesses in South Africa and Israel.
In the reorganised shareholding Unilever has a majority share in a single South African business and fully owns the Unilever Israel foods and home and personal care business.
As a result of this transaction, Unilever reported a profit on disposal of 214 million and goodwill of 168 million.
On 1 January 2007, Unilever completed the restructuring of its Portuguese businesses.
The result of the reorganisation is that Unilever now has a 55% share of the combined Portuguese entity, called Unilever Jernimo Martins.
The combined business includes the foods and home and personal care businesses.
The remaining 45% interest is held by Jernimo Martins Group.
The structure of the agreement is such that there is joint control of the newly formed entity and so it is accounted for by Unilever as a joint venture.
Other disposals in 2007 included the sale of local Brazilian margarine brands.
In addition, to further develop our healthy heart brand margarine, Becel, in Brazil we established a joint venture with Perdigo.
2006 During 2006 we purchased minority interests in subsidiary companies in Greece and Algeria, trademarks in Czech Republic, distribution in Tunisia and Vashisti business in India.
Also an additional investment into Langholm Capital Partners Fund was made and classied as an acquisition of associates see note 11 on page 101.
On 3 November 2006, Unilever announced that it had reached a final agreement with Permira Funds to sell the majority of its European frozen foods business for 1.7 billion.
The Unilever businesses being sold in this transaction include the frozen foods operations in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom.
Other disposals in 2006 were Mora in the Netherlands and Belgium, Finesse in the US, Canada and Sweden, Friol in Italy and Nihar and tea plantations in India.

132 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 29 Share-based compensation plans As at 31 December 2008, the Group had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance shares, share options and other share awards.
Starting in 2007, performance share awards and restricted stock awards were made under the Global Share Incentive Plan GSIP, except in North America where awards were made under the Unilever North America 2002 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.
The numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 60 to 73 and those for key management personnel shown in note 31 on page 135.
No awards were made to Executive Directors in 2006, 2007 or 2008 under the Unilever North America 2002 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the share-based compensation plans.
The economic fair value of the awards is calculated using option pricing models and the resulting cost is recognised as remuneration cost amortised over the vesting period of the grant.
Unilever will not grant share options in total in respect of share-based compensation plans for more than 5% of its issued ordinary capital, and for all plans together, for more than 10% of its issued ordinary capital.
The Board does not apportion these limits to each plan separately.
The actual remuneration cost charged in each period is shown below, and relates almost wholly to equity settled plans: million million million Income statement charge 2008 2007 2006 Performance share plans 97 103 48 a Other plans 28 49 72 125 152 120 a The Group also provides a Share Matching Plan, an All-Employee Share Option Plan, a TSR Long-Term Incentive Plan no awards after 2006 and an Executive Option Plan no awards after 2005.
Performance Share Plans The Global Performance Share Plan GPSP was introduced in 2005.
Under this plan, managers were awarded conditional shares which vest three years later at a level between 0% and 150% for middle management or 200% for senior executives.
The GPSP performance conditions for middle management are achievement of underlying sales growth and ungeared free cash ow targets over a three year period.
For senior executives, in addition to these two conditions, there is an additional target based on TSR ranking in comparison with a peer group over the three year period see description on page 43.
In 2007 we introduced the Global Share Incentive Plan GSIP.
The provisions of this plan are comparable with the GPSP, with the same performance conditions of underlying sales growth and ungeared free cash ow for middle management, and the additional target based on TSR ranking for senior executives.
Starting in 2008, awards made to GSIP participants normally vest at a level between 0% and 200%.
Monte Carlo simulation is used to value the TSR component of the awards.
North America managers participate in the North America Performance Share Programme, introduced in 2001, that awards Unilever shares if North America company performance targets are met over a three-year period.
The amount to be paid to the company by participants to obtain the shares at vesting is zero.
