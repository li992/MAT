On 15 January 2007, the Group converted to a REIT.
As a result the Group no longer pays UK corporation tax on the profits and gains from qualifying rental business in the UK provided that it meets certain conditions.
Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal.
On entering the REIT regime a conversion charge equal to 2% of the aggregate market value of the properties associated with the qualifying rental business was paid.
The Group monitors its compliance with the REIT conditions.
There have been no breaches of the conditions to date.
