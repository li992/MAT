DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT SHAREHOLDER BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INFORMATION 73 Notes to the accounts 1 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The impact of new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations on BG Groups Financial Statements for 2008 is set out below.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRS 8 sets out the requirements for disclosure about an entitys operating segments and also about an entitys products and services, the geographical areas in which it operates and its major customers.
This standard is mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, although earlier application is permitted and BG Group has adopted this standard in its Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008.
IFRS 8 requires a management approach under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
Segment information measured on a Business Performance basis is used for internal reporting purposes.
The adoption of IFRS 8 has not had a significant impact on the presentation of the Groups segmental information.
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 11 provides guidance on how to account in a subsidiary for share-based payment arrangements involving equity instruments of the parent and how to account for share-based payments when an entity receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments.
It was applicable for the year ended 31 December 2008 but did not result in any changes to the Groups Financial Statements.
IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction IFRIC 14 provides guidance on how to account for minimum funding requirements in respect of post-employment defined benefit plans.
Reclassification of Financial Assets amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures The IASB issued amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 in October 2008.
These amendments allow the reclassification of non-derivative financial assets from the fair value through profit and loss category or from the available-for-sale category in certain circumstances.
The amendment is applicable for reclassifications occurring from 1 July 2008 and has not had a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued by the IASB and IFRIC up to the date of this report, but have not been adopted by the Group in these Financial Statements and in some cases have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IAS 23 revised Borrowing Costs The IASB issued amendments to IAS 23 in March 2007.
The main change from the previous version of IAS 23 is the removal of the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale.
The amendments are applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
IAS 1 revised Presentation of Financial Statements The IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 in September 2007.
The main changes from the previous version of IAS 1 are primarily in relation to the reporting of owner changes in equity and comprehensive income.
The amendments are applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and are not expected to have a material impact on the way in which the Group presents its Financial Statements.
IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations The IASB issued IFRS 3 revised in January 2008.
The revised standard has introduced changes to the accounting for contingent consideration and transaction costs, as well as allowing an option to calculate goodwill based on the parents share of net assets only or including goodwill relating to minority interests non-controlling interests.
The standard is applicable to business combinations arising in accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and will affect future business combinations undertaken by the Group.
IAS 27 revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements The IASB issued IAS 27 revised in January 2008.
The revisions require the effects of transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity when there is no change in control, and specify the accounting on loss of control.
The revisions are applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and will affect future business combinations and disposals undertaken by the Group.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 2 in January 2008.
The amendment clarified the definition of vesting conditions and the accounting treatment of cancellations, including cancellations by parties other than the Company.
The amendment is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation The IASB issued amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 in February 2008.
The amendments address the classification of certain puttable financial instruments which impose an obligation to deliver a pro-rata share of net assets on liquidation.
BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2008 74 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 1 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS continued Improvements to IFRSs The IASB issued amendments to a number of IFRSs in May 2008 as part of its annual improvement project.
Most of the amendments are applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 Cost of an Investment in a subsidiary, jointly controlled entity or associate The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 in May 2008.
The amendments allow first-time adopters of IFRS to use a deemed cost of either fair value or carrying value under previous GAAP for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates in separate financial statements, and require dividends from these investments to be recognised as income in separate financial statements.
Eligible Hedged Items an amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement The IASB issued an amendment to IAS 39 in July 2008.
The amendment clarifies how the existing principles underlying hedge accounting should be applied in the designation of a one-sided risk in a hedged item and inflation in a financial hedged item.
The amendment is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures In March 2009 the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 7.
These amendments introduce a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement disclosures and require entities to provide additional disclosures about the relative reliability of fair value measurements.
In addition the amendments clarify and enhance existing requirements for the disclosure of liquidity risk.
The amendments are applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
Interpretations issued by IFRIC IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements provides guidance on the accounting by operators for public-to-private service concession arrangements.
The interpretation is expected to be applied by BG Group for the first time in the accounting period beginning 1 January 2010.
This interpretation is not likely to have a material impact on the earnings or net assets of the Group.
In addition, up to the end of 2008, IFRIC issued IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008, IFRIC 15 Agreements for the construction of real estate, applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation, applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008 and IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners, applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
These interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
In 2009, IFRIC issued IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers.
BG Group is currently reviewing the interpretation to determine the likely impact on the Group.
com DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT SHAREHOLDER BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INFORMATION 75 2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS AND RESULTS PRESENTATION BG Groups reportable segments are those used by management to run the business and are based on differences in the Groups products and services.
Segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
BG Groups four principal operating and reporting segments in 2008 comprise Exploration and Production E&P, Liquefied Natural Gas LNG, Transmission and Distribution T&D, and Power Generation Power.
E&P comprises exploration, development, production and marketing of hydrocarbons with a focus on natural gas.
LNG combines the development and use of LNG import and export facilities with the purchase, shipping and sale of LNG and regasified natural gas.
T&D develops, owns and operates major pipelines and distribution networks, and supplies natural gas through these to the end customer.
Power develops, owns and operates natural gas-fired power generation plants around the world.
Other activities primarily comprise revenue from the supply of gas to natural gas vehicles NGVs and costs relating to business development expenditure and certain corporate activities.
In 2008, the operations were structured in three main geographical areas: Europe and Central Asia region, Africa, Middle East and Asia region and Americas and Global LNG region.
Prior year information has been restated to reflect these geographical areas.
Intra-group and inter-segment sales are settled at market prices and are generally based on the same prices as those charged to third parties arms length principle.
Group revenue, profit for the year, non-current assets, net assets, gross assets and gross liabilities, depreciation and amortisation and capital investment attributable to BG Group activities are shown on pages 75 to 78, analysed by operating segment.
Additional information on capital investment is also provided on a geographical basis.
The presentation of BG Groups results under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS separately identifies the effect of the re-measurement of certain financial instruments and profits and losses on the disposal and impairment of non-current assets and businesses.
Results excluding disposals, certain re-measurements and impairments Business Performance are used by management and are presented in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating performance of the Groups ongoing business.
Further information on Business Performance is given on page 135.
Disposals, re-measurements and impairments include unrealised gains and losses in respect of certain long-term UK gas sales contracts classified as derivatives under IAS 39, commodity instruments used to manage certain price exposures in respect of optimising the timing and location of physical gas and LNG commitments, and financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate exposure.
The separate presentation of these items best reflects the underlying performance of the business since it distinguishes between the temporary timing differences associated with re-measurements under IAS 39 rules and actual realised gains and losses.
Under IFRS the results from jointly controlled entities joint ventures and associates are presented net of tax and finance costs on the face of the income statement.
It is also relevant to present the operating profit of the Group including results of joint ventures and associates before interest and tax.
The following tables provide a reconciliation between the overall results and Business Performance and operating profit including and excluding the results of joint ventures and associates.

In 2008, the charge in respect of Performance Share Awards was 2m 2007 nil.
The fair value of shares allocated during the year in respect of the Performance Share Award Scheme is estimated using a Monte Carlo projection model with the following assumptions: weighted average share price of 11.19, exercise price of nil, a risk-free rate of 3.6% and a vesting period of three years.
The model also contains assumptions for both the Group and each member of the industry peer group as set out on page 57 in respect of volatility, average share price growth and share price correlation.
The fair value reflects the probability of market performance conditions being achieved.
The fair value of shares allocated during the year was 5.67 per share.
The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of shares for the Performance Share Awards are based on US data because most of the companies selected as industry peers are US-based.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the share price over the previous three year period.
Share price correlation was determined by calculating the historical correlation of the share price over the previous three year period.
Average share price growth was determined from historical growth over the previous year.
As at 31 December 2008, notional allocations of 3.2m ordinary shares were outstanding under the Performance Share Award Scheme.

In 2008, the charge in respect of the Sharesave Scheme was 1m 2007 1m.
The fair value of share options granted during the year in respect of the Sharesave Scheme is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: weighted average share price of 8.00 2007 10.06, exercise price of 7.66 2007 7.16, dividend yield of 1.0% 2007 1.0%, volatility of 38% 2007 25%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 2.23% 2007 4.47% and a weighted average expected life of three years 2007 three years.
The average fair value of share options granted during the year was 2.24 per share 2007 3.76 per share.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three year period.
The expected life used in the model is based on the contractual terms in the Sharesave Scheme.
Share Incentive Plan Details of the BG Group Share Incentive Plan SIP are given on page 58.
During the year, 0.4m ordinary shares were awarded as Free Shares under the plan in respect of 2007 performance 2007 0.6m ordinary shares.
Under IFRS 2, the charge to the income statement in respect of the award is based on the market value of the shares at the grant date recognised over the previous 15 months.

In 2008, the charge in respect of the SIP was nil 2007 4m.
Cash-Settled Share-Based Payments Cash-settled share-based payments arise when the Group incurs a liability to transfer cash amounts that are based on the price or value of the Companys shares.
A charge of 1m has been made in respect of cash-settled CSOS awards 2007 4m the terms of which are the same as the equity-settled CSOS awards and a credit of 2m 2007 22m charge has been made in respect of social security costs on employee share option and share schemes.
The charge for cash-settled CSOS awards and social security costs on employee share option and share schemes covers awards made before and after 7 November 2002.
During the vesting period the costs of the cash-settled CSOS awards are charged to the income statement based on the fair value of the share option at the balance sheet date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
The fair value of the non-vested cash-settled options at the balance sheet date has been estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: share price of 9.57 2007 11.50, weighted average exercise price of 7.87 2007 7.67, dividend yield of 1.0% 2007 1.0%, volatility of 34.10% 2007 22.60%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 2.26% 2007 4.72% and a weighted average expected life of four years 2007 five years.
The average fair value of non-vested cash-settled CSOS awards at the balance sheet date was 3.23 2007 5.04.
For awards that had vested, but not been exercised at the balance sheet date, the fair value was the intrinsic value of the award at the balance sheet date.
The credit charge to the income statement in respect of social security costs has been calculated based on the fair value of the awards at the balance sheet date multiplied by the current employers National Insurance rate.
The fair value of the awards that had not vested at the balance sheet date has been estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The reduction in the Companys share price as at 31 December 2008 compared to 31 December 2007 has resulted in a credit to the income statement in 2008.
For CSOS awards the following assumptions were used: share price of 9.57 2007 11.50, weighted average exercise price of 7.46 2007 6.68, dividend yield of 1.0% 2007 1.0%, volatility of 34.10% 2007 22.60%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 2.04% 2007 4.70% and a weighted average expected life of three years 2007 four years.

The disposals completed in July 2008 for a cash consideration of 19m, resulting in a preand post-tax charge to the income statement of 16m.
In 2008, other plant disposals and write-offs resulted in a pre-tax charge to the income statement of 8m post-tax 7m.
2007 In June 2007, the Group sold its 25% equity interest in Interconnector UK Limited, within the T&D segment, whilst retaining its throughput capacity contracts with this company.
This resulted in a preand post-tax gain on disposal of 157m.
As part of this transaction, the Group reviewed the retained capacity contracts in the Interconnector pipeline and concluded that the obligations associated with these contracts exceeded the benefit expected to be received from the Interconnector interest.
Accordingly, a pre-tax provision of 156m post-tax 124m was made to reflect the present obligation under these contracts.
The overall transaction generated a pre-tax gain on disposal of 1m post-tax 33m.
In 2007, other disposals of E&P assets resulted in a preand post-tax gain on disposal of 18m.

As at 31 December 2008, the majority of the goodwill recognised related to Comgs, which is classified within the T&D segment and was defined as a cash generating unit CGU for impairment testing purposes.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that it might be impaired.
No goodwill impairment has been recognised.
The recoverable amount of the Comgs CGU is determined from the value in use calculations, using cash flow projections based on approved financial plans covering a five year period.
The growth rate assumptions used in the plans were based on past performance and managements expectations of market development.
The annual growth rates in the business plan used to determine cash flows beyond the five year period are between 5% and 11% and do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
In 2007, the Masspower power plant was acquired and provisional fair values were provided, pending finalisation in 2008.
The Masspower power plant is included within the US Power business and classified within the Power segment.
The fair value exercise was completed during the year.
A re-assessment of contractual rights resulted in a 13m reduction in intangible assets.
This has resulted in 13m of goodwill as set out in note 14, page 92.
Comparatives have not been restated as the amount involved was not material.
The recoverable amount of the US Power business is determined from value in use calculations, using cash flow projections based on approved financial plans covering a five year period.
The annual growth rate in the business plan used to determine cash flows beyond the five year period is 3% and does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets, except for an assumption, consistent with widely used industry expectations, that capacity payments will increase materially around the middle of the next decade before reverting to an average annual growth rate of 4%.
The projected cash flows used for the value in use calculations for Comgs and US Power are adjusted for associated risks and are discounted using a nominal rate of 8% pre-tax.

14 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS In 2008, the Group acquired Queensland Gas Company Limited QGC, a major Australian coal seam gas company.
The integration of QGC will allow the Group to optimise the development of the Queensland Curtis LNG project as well as expand QGCs resource base for the supply of both domestic and export markets, giving the Group a major LNG producing presence in the key Asia Pacific market.
On 11 April 2008, the Group purchased 81 278 451 equity shares of QGC for a total of 118m.
The equity interest represented 9.9% of QGCs issued share capital at that time.
On 28 October 2008, the Group announced its offer for all remaining QGC shares in issue at A$5.75 per share and subsequently announced on 4 November 2008 that it had received sufficient unconditional acceptances to provide the Group with a controlling interest.
As at 31 December 2008, the Group held 97.8% of shares in QGC and has not recognised minority interests as the remaining shares are subject to a compulsory purchase procedure which is expected to be completed in 2009.

The adjustments relate primarily to, but are not limited to, the revaluation of exploration and production non-current intangible assets.
The fair values attributable to the net assets acquired of QGC are considered provisional as at 31 December 2008.
It is anticipated that finalisation of the initial accounting will not result in material adjustments to the net assets acquired.
The total consideration of 2 209m included 2m of directly attributable costs.
The Groups results for the year include operating losses of 4m and a loss after tax of 1m for the combined entity.
If the combined entity had been acquired at the beginning of the year, it is estimated that BG Groups consolidated revenue and profit after tax would have been 26m and 6m higher respectively.
BG Group also entered into an option agreement with AGL Energy Limited AGL under which AGL has the right to acquire certain assets that the Group acquired as part of the business combination.

As part of its business operations, the Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in order to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.
The Group enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the composition of floating and fixed rate debt.
The Group enters into currency derivatives to hedge certain foreign currency cash flows and to adjust the currency composition of its assets and liabilities.
Certain agreements are combined foreign currency and interest swap transactions, described as cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The Groups policy is not to use interest and exchange rate derivatives for speculative purposes.
Further information on treasury risks is contained in the Business Review on page 17.
BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2008 96 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS Within the ordinary course of business the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for commodities.
The majority of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the commodity in accordance with the Groups expected sale, purchase or usage requirements.
Such contracts are not within the scope of IAS 39.
Certain long-term gas sales contracts in the UK fall within the scope of IAS 39.
These contracts include pricing terms which are based on a variety of commodities and indices.
They are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Certain short-term market traded contracts for the purchase and subsequent resale of third-party commodities are within the scope of IAS 39 and are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Group uses various commodity based derivative instruments to manage some of the risks arising from fluctuations in commodity prices.
Such contracts include physical and net-settled forwards, futures, swaps and options.
Where these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges of underlying commodity price exposures, certain gains and losses attributable to these instruments are deferred in equity and subsequently recognised in the income statement when the underlying hedged transaction crystallises.
Commodity derivatives that are not part of a hedging relationship are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
These have all been included within other commodity derivatives in the following tables.
Further information on commodity price exposure is contained in the Business Review on page 17.
VALUATION The Group calculates the fair value of interest rate and currency exchange rate derivative instruments by using market valuations where available or, where not available, by discounting all future cash flows by the relevant market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of commodity contracts and commodity related derivatives is based on forward price curves, where available.
Where observable market valuations are unavailable, the fair value on initial recognition is the transaction price and is subsequently determined using quotes from third-parties or the Groups forward planning assumptions for the price of gas, other commodities and indices.
One of the assumptions underlying the fair value of long-term UK gas contracts is that the gas market in the UK is liquid for two years.
As at 31 December 2008, the average two year forward price for UK gas was 57p per therm 2007 51p per therm.
Beyond this period a seasonally adjusted UK gas price of 45p per therm 2007 45p per therm has been used along with an electricity price of 45 per megawatt hour 2007 45 per megawatt hour.
The fair values of the long-term commodity contracts are then discounted using the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
Using these assumptions, the change in fair value of long-term UK gas contracts credited to the income statement in the year is 131m 2007 140m charge.
As at 31 December 2008, the potential change in the fair value of long-term commodity contracts, assuming a 10% change in the price assumptions, was 26m 2007 27m.

Derivative financial instruments are treated as expiring within one year and classified within current assets and current liabilities unless they form part of a designated hedge relationship, when they are classified according to the period in which the derivative is expected to expire.
Included within derivatives classified as expiring within one year are the long-term UK gas contracts which expire between 2009 and 2014 2007 between 2009 and 2014, other commodity derivatives which expire between 2009 and 2017 2007 between 2008 and 2017, and certain currency and cross-currency interest rate derivatives that are not part of a formal hedging relationship which expire between 2009 and 2036 2007 between 2008 and 2036. www.

Further information can be found in the Business Review on page 17.
Fair value hedges As at 31 December 2008, the Group held a number of interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as hedges of the fair value risk associated with the Groups fixed rate debt.
The Group also held a number of commodity derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value risk associated with fixed price firm sales commitments.
The hedged items and the related derivatives have the same critical terms to ensure that they are an effective hedge under IAS 39.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as at 31 December 2008 is 36 m 2007 8m.
During 2008, adjustments of 50m 2007 3 m have been made to hedged items in respect of the risks being hedged.
Cash flow hedges The Group has forward commodity contracts and currency exchange rate derivatives designated as hedges of highly probable forecast purchases and sales.
As at 31 December 2008, an unrealised pre-tax gain of 750m 2007 54m loss was deferred in equity in respect of effective cash flow hedges.
The hedged transactions are expected to occur within three years 2007 four years following the year end and the associated gains and losses deferred in equity will be released to the income statement as the underlying transaction crystallises.
As at 31 December 2008, deferred pre-tax gains of 397m 2007 15m loss are expected to be released to the income statement within one year.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as at 31 December 2008 is 745m 2007 53 m. During 2008, certain forecast commodity sales for which cash flow hedge accounting was used were no longer expected to occur.
This resulted in the transfer of an unrealised pre-tax loss of 10m from equity to the income statement.
The related cash flow hedges were discontinued prospectively.

Within floating rate financial assets, cash and cash equivalents earn interest at the relevant market rates or, where invested in money market liquidity funds, as determined by the investment returns of the relevant fund.

The fair values of the fixed rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans have been estimated based on quoted market prices where available, or by discounting all future cash flows by the relevant market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of floating rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans approximate book value as interest rates on these instruments reset on a frequent basis.
Fair values have not been obtained for the non-interest bearing loans to joint ventures and associates as repayment of these loans are linked to the performance of the individual joint venture or associate and it is therefore not practicable to assign fair values.

Short-term creditors are contractually payable within one year and are non-interest bearing.
The fair value of the financial instruments approximates book value.
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The principal financial risks arising from financial instruments are commodity price risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
A description of these principal risks is outlined in the Business Review on page 17.
Additional quantitative information and market sensitivities in relation to certain principal market risks are included in the section below.
Liquidity risk The Group limits the amount of borrowings maturing within any specific period and the Groups financial assets are primarily held as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
These measures keep liquidity risk low.
The Group proposes to meet its financial commitments from both the operating cash flows of the business and from use of the money and capital markets, including existing committed lines of credit.
The undiscounted contractual cash flows receivable payable under financial instruments as at the balance sheet date are as follows: THE GROUP Between Between Within one and two two and five After five as at 31 December 2008 one year years years years Total m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 433 283 780 1 993 3 489 Short-term creditors 822 822 Other financial liabilities 29 29 1 255 283 780 2 022 4 340 Outflows from derivative financial instruments Currency exchange and cross-currency interest rate derivatives 3 829 1 918 1 548 817 8 112 Gross settled commodity derivatives 1 502 741 253 2 496 Net settled commodity derivatives 167 87 25 279 5 498 2 746 1 826 817 10 887 Non-derivative financial assets and inflows from derivative financial instruments 9 586 4 039 2 802 1 772 18 199 Total as at 31 December 2008 2 833 1 010 196 1 067 2 972 BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2008 100 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS continued Between Between Within one and two two and five After five as at 31 December 2007 one year years years years Total m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 406 236 732 1 809 3 183 Short-term creditors 906 906 Other financial liabilities 20 20 1 312 236 732 1 829 4 109 Outflows from derivative financial instruments Interest rate derivatives 1 1 2 Currency exchange and cross-currency interest rate derivatives 417 1 512 1 696 430 4 055 Gross settled commodity derivatives 1 106 273 175 1 554 Net settled commodity derivatives 64 39 24 127 1 588 1 824 1 896 430 5 738 Non-derivative financial assets and inflows from derivative financial instruments 5 712 2 714 3 000 1 317 12 743 Total as at 31 December 2007 2 812 654 372 942 2 896 Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale customers including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are normally accepted.
Limits are established for banks and financial institutions and Group management monitors exposures periodically.
If wholesale customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, business credit policies dictate the credit quality assessment which takes account of financial position and other factors.
Limits are established for wholesale trading businesses and business and Group management monitors overall exposures periodically.
As at 31 December 2008, the Groups maximum credit risk exposure after the impact of any netting arrangements under interest rate related derivatives was 19m 2007 7m, currency derivatives 271m 2007 127m and commodity related derivatives 937m 2007 307m.
The Groups credit risk exposure under short-term debtors and other financial assets is represented by the book values.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposures spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
com DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT SHAREHOLDER BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INFORMATION 101 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Sensitivity analysis Financial instruments used by the Group that are affected by market risks primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and derivative contracts.
The principal market variables that affect the value of these financial instruments are UK and US interest rates, US Dollar to pound Sterling exchange rates, UK and US gas prices and Japan Crude Cocktail JCC prices.

Provision is made for the estimated cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet date, to the extent that current circumstances indicate BG Group will ultimately bear this cost.
The payment dates of total expected future decommissioning costs are uncertain but are currently anticipated to be between 2011 and 2047.

The deferred tax liability of 2 056m 2007 1 258m is shown after the offset of certain deferred tax assets relating to the same fiscal authority: the liability prior to such offset is 2 613m 2007 1 724m.
The net amount expected to be settled after more than 12 months is 2 163m 2007 1 258m.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 2 488m 2007 1 960m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Company had a deferred tax asset of 5m 2007 7m.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, unutilised tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable income is probable.
The Group has unrecognised deductible temporary differences of 334m 2007 78m and unrecognised tax losses of 631m 2007 389m to carry forward against future taxable income.
To the extent unutilised, 158m of these losses will expire by 2018.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised capital losses of 249m 2007 252m : these tax losses can only be offset against specific types of future capital gains.
The Group also has unrecognised overseas tax credits of 383m 2007 181m.

Charges have also been brought against certain former directors of Brindisi LNG, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Italia, who are alleged to have unlawfully permitted the occupation and alteration of public land, namely the port area in Brindisi where the regasification terminal is due to be constructed, as a result of improperly authorised permits.
The trial in relation to these criminal charges commenced on 4 February 2009 and has been adjourned until 25 March 2009.
In addition, the Italian authorities may still be carrying out further investigations, the scope of which is unknown.
The Municipality of Brindisi, Province of Brindisi and Region of Puglia and three groups of environmentalists Italia Nostra, Legambiente and World Wildlife Fund WWF Italia have separately commenced civil claims seeking damages against the accused individuals and against BG Italia.
These cases have been brought within the framework of the criminal case.
In October 2007, BG Group received formal notification from the Ministry of Economic Development that the original Article 8 authorisation for the construction and operation of Brindisi LNG had been suspended pending the submission by BG Group of a full Environmental Impact Assessment EIA and confirmation from the Italian authorities as to the validity of the Article 8 authorisation.
On 15 January 2008, BG Group commenced the EIA approval process by submitting an EIA.
Notwithstanding that BG Group has commenced the EIA approval process, BG Group has challenged the suspension of the Article 8 authorisation in the administrative courts.
The Municipality of Brindisi has also challenged the suspension, arguing that the authorisation should have been annulled rather than suspended.
This action, if successful, could result in the authorisation being annulled, subject to any rights of appeal.
There are various other ongoing legal proceedings relating to the Brindisi LNG regasification terminal, for example relating to consents necessary for the construction work and environmental procedures.
The impact of these legal proceedings cannot yet be quantified but could delay or deny BG Group access to the Brindisi LNG terminal site.
In addition, various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot readily be foreseen, it is considered that they will be resolved without material effect on the net asset position as shown in these Financial Statements.

BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2008 108 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 27 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The majority of the Groups UK employees participate in the BG Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme is of the defined benefit type.
It is a registered pension scheme established under trust.
The Trustee is BG Group Pension Trustees Limited.
The Scheme is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
It is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the independent qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the Schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the Scheme.
Most members contribute to the Scheme at a rate of 3% of pensionable salary.
Participating employers contributions, including Scheme expenses, are certified by the Schemes independent qualified actuary.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the employers contribution rate in respect of most Scheme members was effectively 26.9% of pensionable pay.
A full independent actuarial valuation of the Scheme for funding purposes as at 31 March 2008 is currently underway.
The previous actuarial valuation, as at 31 March 2005, showed that the aggregate market value of the Schemes assets at 31 March 2005 was 318m, representing some 91% of the accrued liabilities.
In the period 2006 to 2008, the Group made payments totalling 33m in order to reduce the Schemes deficit.
The BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme is available to provide benefits in excess of the new lifetime allowance.
This scheme is an unfunded, unregistered arrangement.
With effect from 2 April 2007 new UK employees have been offered membership of a defined contribution stakeholder pension plan, the BG Group Retirement Benefits Plan the Plan.
Life assurance and income protection benefits are also provided under separate plans: these benefits are fully insured.
Members may choose the rate at which they contribute to the Plan and the employers contribution is determined by the rate that the member selects.
A wide range of funds is available from which members may choose how the contributions will be invested.
The cost of the Plan has been included in the amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement under the requirements of IAS 19 in the table below.
There is an unfunded post-retirement employee benefit plan for healthcare in respect of employees of Comgs.
Provision has been made in respect of this plan.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes and smaller defined benefit schemes.
These are not material in Group terms.
The following information in respect of the Scheme, the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme and the Comgs post-retirement healthcare plan described hereafter as the plans has been provided in accordance with IAS 19.
Valuations of all of the plans assets and expected liabilities as at 31 December 2008 were carried out by independent actuaries in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19.
In calculating the charge to the income statement including any recognised actuarial gains and losses, a 10% corridor was applied.
This means that a portion of actuarial gains and losses is recognised as income or expense only if it exceeds the greater of: a 10% of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at that date before deducting plan assets : and b 10% of the fair value of any plan assets at that date.
These limits are calculated and applied separately for each defined benefit plan at each balance sheet date and the portion of actuarial gains and losses to be recognised in future years for each plan is the excess of actuarial gains and losses over and above the 10% limits divided by the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in that plan.
The valuations as at 31 December were based on the following assumptions: 2008 2007 Comgs Comgs healthcare healthcare BG plans plan BG plans plan % % % % a Rate of price inflation and benefit increases 3.3 5.0 3.5 5.0 Future increases in earnings 5.3 n a 5.5 n a Discount rate 6.3 13.1 5.6 11.3 Healthcare cost trend rate n a 8.1 n a 9.2 a Rate of increase of deferred pensions and pensions in payment in excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension element.
In addition, an allowance has been made for a real increase in deferred pensions and current pensions of 2.25% in 2010.
If the discount rate used for the valuation of the BG plans was reduced by 0.1% to 6.2%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by 15m and the service cost for 2009 would increase by 1m.
com DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT SHAREHOLDER BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INFORMATION 109 27 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued In determining the defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2008 for the BG Group plans, mortality assumptions are based on the 1992 mortality series issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, appropriate to the members year of birth, with an allowance for projected longevity improvements in line with the CMI Bureaus medium cohort tables, subject to a minimum rate of improvement on the projected mortality rates of 1% per annum.
Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners on the measurement date and also of pensioners in ten years time are as follows: Life expectancy of pensioners years 31 Dec 2008 31 Dec 2018 Male age 60 27.3 28.3 Male age 65 22.3 23.3 Female age 60 30.5 31.5 Female age 65 25.5 26.4 If the life expectancy of a member currently age 60 was increased by one year, with consistent changes for members at other ages, the defined benefit obligation in respect of the BG plans would increase by 12m and the service cost for 2009 would increase by 1m.
As at 31 December 2008, the value of the plans assets and expected rates of return, together with the liabilities in the plans, were as follows: 2008 2007 Expected Percentage Expected Percentage rate of of plans rate of of plans return a assets Value return a assets Value % % m % % m Equities 8.2 58 295 7.9 63 372 Absolute return strategies 8.2 15 73 7.4 22 128 Index-linked gilts 4.3 5 24 4.6 5 28 Corporate bonds 6.3 9 48 5.9 10 60 Money market funds and cash 4.1 13 66 4.5 3 Total market value of assets 506 591 Present value of liabilities 734 792 Deficit in plans 228 201 Unrecognised net loss 50 36 Net benefit liability 178 165 a Long-term expected rate of return.
