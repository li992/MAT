FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 22.
The Groups banking facilities require hedging of 40% of the funds drawn.
The Group has complied with this during the year.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
Balance sheet management The Groups Board reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group seeks to have a conservative gearing ratio the proportion of net debt to equity.
The Board considers at each review the appropriateness of the current ratio in light of the above.
The Board is currently satisfied with the Groups gearing ratio.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Debt 284,000 190,000 Cash and cash equivalents 1,671 2,110 Net Debt 282,329 187,890 Balance sheet equity 580,105 487,979 Net debt to equity ratio 48.7% 38.5% Debt is defined as longand short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 18.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the parent.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Debt management The Group borrows through a senior term loan, secured on its existing store portfolio.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short term liquidity.
Funding is arranged through a syndicate of blue chip banks and financial institutions, with whom the Group has a strong working relationship.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued C. Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite: ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group has the following interest rate derivatives in place rate shown excludes margin : 10 million vanilla swap fixed at 5.11%, expiring in January 2010.
This is subject to a structured collar which links to the variable rate, providing LIBOR is between 3.95% and 5.68%.
The rate payable is capped if LIBOR is outside that range.
80 million fixed at 5.24% until September 2012.
These swaps are callable quarterly by the bank.
50 million vanilla swap fixed at 5.4% until December 2012.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
The loss in the income statement for the year of these interest rate swaps was 3,382,000 2007: profit of 654,000.
The fair value of the above derivatives was a liability of 2,870,000 2007: asset of 512,000.
D. Interest rate sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings, without jeopardising its flexibility.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 March 2008, it is estimated that an increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Groups annual profit before tax by 947,000 2007: 1.33 million and a decrease of one percentage point in interest rates would have increased the Groups annual profit before tax by 1,440,000 2007: 1.7 million.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
E. Cash management and liquidity Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 18 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Short term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
F. Foreign currency management The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
G. Credit risk The credit risk management policies of the Group with respect to trade receivables are discussed in note 15.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over 30,000 customers in our stores.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivatives is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies, in line with the Groups policy which is to borrow from major institutional banks when arranging finance.
H. Financial maturity analysis In respect of interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table provides a maturity analysis for individual elements.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued H. Financial maturity analysis continued 2007 Maturity Less than One to Two to More than Total one year two years five years five years 000 000 000 000 000 Debt Bank loan payable at variable rate 170,000 170,000 Debt fixed by interest rate derivatives 20,000 20,000 Total 190,000 190,000 The interest rate collar referred to in note 17c was paying on the variable rate at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period mainly due to the reduction in variable rate debt instruments and the increase in interest rate swaps.
