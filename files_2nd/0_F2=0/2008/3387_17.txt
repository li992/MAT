58 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1.
General information Chemring Group PLC is a company incorporated in England and Wales under registration number 86662.
The address of the registered of ce is Chemring House, 1500 Parkway, Whiteley, Fareham, Hampshire PO15 7AF.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 5 and in the Directors Report on pages 34 to 37.
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Chemring Group PLC and its subsidiaries the Group.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policy set out in Note 3 of the financial statements.
Adoption of new and revised standards In the year under review two Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee were effective.
These were IFRIC11 IFRS2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions and IFRIC14 IAS19 The Limit on a fide ned Bene t Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The adoption of these Interpretations has not led to any changes in the Groups accounting policies.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS1 amended IAS27 amended Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate IFRS2 amended Share-based Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations IFRS3 revised 2008 Business Combinations IFRS8 Operating Segments effective from 1 January 2009 IAS1 revised 2007 Presentation of Financial Statements effective 1 January 2009 IAS23 Borrowing Costs effective 1 January 2009 IAS27 revised 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS32 amended IAS1 amended Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation IFRIC12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate IFRIC16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union.
These will be those IAS, IFRS and related Interpretations Standing Interpretations Committee SIC International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations, subsequent amendments to those standards and related interpretations, future standards and related interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that have been endorsed by the European Commission collectively referred to as IFRS.
These are subject to ongoing review and endorsement by the European Commission or possible amendment by interpretive guidance from the IASB and the IFRIC and are therefore still subject to change.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The particular accounting policies adopted have been applied consistently throughout the current and previous year and are described below.
Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiaries.
A subsidiary undertaking is an entity over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated from the date on which control passes to the Group and the results of disposed subsidiaries are consolidated up to the date on which control passes from the Group.
All companies within the Group make up their financial statements to the same date.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 59 3.
Accounting policies continued Operating pro t Operating pro t is stated before the share of results of associates and before finance expense.
Operating pro t excludes the results of discontinued operations.
Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for deliveries made, work completed or services rendered during the year, net of discounts, VAT and other revenue related taxes.
Revenue is recognised when title passes, or when the right to consideration, in exchange for performance, has been completed.
For bill and hold arrangements revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards are transferred to the customer, typically on formal acceptance.
An appropriate proportion of total long term contract value, based on the fair value of work performed, is included in revenue and an appropriate level of pro t is taken based on the percentage completion method when the final outcome can be reliably assessed.
Provision is made in full for foreseeable losses as soon as they are identi ed.
Investment income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Acquisitions On acquisition of a subsidiary, the cost is measured as the fair value of the consideration given plus any directly attributable costs.
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary that meet the IFRS3 Business Combinations recognition criteria are measured at the fair value at the date of acquisition.
Where cost exceeds fair value of the net assets acquired the difference is recorded as goodwill.
Where the fair value of the net assets exceeds the cost, the difference is recorded directly in the income statement.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed where necessary to be consistent with those of the Group.
Intangible assets Goodwill The purchased goodwill of the Group is regarded as having an inde nite useful economic life and, in accordance with IAS36 Impairment of Assets, is not amortised but is subject to annual tests for impairment.
In reviewing the carrying value of goodwill of the various businesses the Board has considered the separate plans and cash ows of these businesses consistent with the requirements of IAS36 and is satis ed that these demonstrate that no impairment has occurred in respect of continuing operations.
Goodwill arising on acquisition before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the pro t or loss on disposal.
For acquisitions after 1 November 2004 the Group recognises separately from goodwill intangible assets that are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights and whose fair value can be measured reliably.
These intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, averaging ten years.
Other intangibles Research and development expenditure Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure, where it meets certain criteria given below, is capitalised on a straight-line basis over typically three years from the date commercial production commences.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
An intangible development asset is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: the development costs are separately identi able: the development costs can be measured reliably: management are satis ed as to the ultimate technical and commercial viability of the project: and it is probable that the asset will generate future economic bene ts.
Patents and trademarks Patents and trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
60 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 3.
Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Other than revalued land and buildings, property, plant and equipment are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
On other assets depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down their cost or valuation to their estimated residual values by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives, which are considered to be: Freehold buildings up to 50 years Leasehold buildings the period of the lease Plant and equipment 10 years Impairment of non-current assets Assets that have inde nite lives are tested for impairment annually.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment loss is recorded for the difference as an expense in the income statement.
The recoverable amount used for impairment testing is the higher of the value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal.
For the purpose of impairment testing assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identi able cash ows.
Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads and is determined using the first-in first-out FIFO method.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provision is made for slow moving, obsolete and defective items where appropriate.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro t for the year.
Taxable pro t differs from net pro t as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items of income that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro t, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable taxable pro ts will be available in the future against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax pro t nor the accounting pro t. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suf cient taxable pro ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Special capital reserve The special capital reserve was created as part of a capital reduction scheme involving the cancellation of the share premium account which was approved by the Court in 1986 and is in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 61 3.
Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not re-translated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the re-translation of monetary items, are included in the pro t or loss for the period.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and forward currency structures which are accounted for as derivative financial instruments see below for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insigni cant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classi ed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis to the Income Statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
62 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 3.
Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of interest rate and foreign currency transactions, and it uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to these transactional risks.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts and other forward currency structures to reduce these exposures and does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contract is entered into and are revalued at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method by which any gain or loss is recognised depends on whether the instrument is designated a hedging instrument or not.
To be designated as a hedging instrument the instrument must be documented as such at inception and must be assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash ows of hedged items.
Hedge accounting principles are used for foreign currency forward contracts net investment hedge and interest rate swaps cash ow hedge where movements in fair value are held in equity until such time as the underlying amounts of the contract mature.
At maturity or disposal of the net investment the amounts held in equity will be recycled to the Income Statement.
Changes in fair value of any ineffective portion of net investment hedges and interest rate swaps are recognised in the Income Statement immediately.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated by independent third party valuers.
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting the changes in fair value are immediately recognised in the Income Statement.
Embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the host contract are treated as separate derivatives, with unrealised gains and losses reported in the Income Statement.
Retirement bene t costs Payments to fide ned contribution retirement bene t schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For fide ned bene t schemes, the cost of providing bene ts is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of the pro t or loss and presented in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense SORIE.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the bene ts are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the bene ts become vested.
The retirement bene t obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Leased assets Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
The asset is recorded in the Balance Sheet as property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life and the lease term.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included in creditors.
The finance element of the instalments is charged to the Income Statement at a constant rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligation.
All other leases are operating leases and the rental charges are taken to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Share-based compensation The Group operates equity settled and cash settled share-based compensation schemes.
For grants made under the Groups share-based compensation schemes, the fair value is calculated at the grant date with changes in the fair value recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The valuation of the options utilises a methodology based on the Black-Scholes model.
For equity settled share-based grants, the total amount recognised is based on the fair value of the equity instrument measured at the date the award is made.
At each balance sheet date the impact of any revision to vesting estimates is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period.
Proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital and share premium.
CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 63 3.
Accounting policies continued For cash settled share-based grants, the total amount recognised is based on the fair value of the liability incurred.
The fair value of the liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date with changes in the fair value recognised in the Income Statement for the period.
Post balance sheet events Following IAS10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, the Group continues to disclose events that it considers material and non-disclosure of which can in uence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty When applying the Groups accounting policies, management must make assumptions and estimates concerning the future that affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenue and expenses recognised during the accounting period.
Such assumptions and estimates are based upon factors such as historical experience, the observance of trends in the industries in which the Group operates, and information available from the Groups customers and other outside sources.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a signi cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year include: Goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to determine such assets, to estimate the future cash ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and to determine a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations Under IFRS3 Business Combinations, it is necessary to separately identify and value any acquired intangible assets.
In order to ascertain the values of the separate assets it is necessary for management to estimate the future cash ows attributable to the asset and estimate their useful economic lives.
Pensions The liability recognised in relation to retirement bene t obligations is dependent on a number of assumptions, including discount rate, mortality rate, salary increases and in ation.
Any change in these assumptions would change the amount recognised see Note 35.
Revenue All of the Groups revenue is derived from the sale of goods.
The following table provides an analysis of the Groups revenue by destination.
There was no discontinued revenue in 2008 2007: 3.8 million.
Full disclosure is given in Note 34.
Total revenue including finance income was 356.0 million 2007: 255.3 million.

The recoverable amounts of the CGU are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, the growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period for which management have detailed plans.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that re ect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the CGU being measured the weighted average cost of capital WACC.
The growth rates are based on a prudent view of industry growth forecasts adjusted for a premium associated with the high technological nature of the businesses.
A growth assumption of 2.5% 2007: 2.5% has been used.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash ows after that period based on growth as described above.
Following a detailed review, no impairment losses for continuing operations have been recognised in the year and no prior impairment losses reversed.

Bank loans held with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania USA are secured on the related assets purchased with these loans by Alloy Surfaces Company, Inc.
The security over the US loan notes ranks pari passu with that held by Bank of Scotland.
As the loans are re-translated to the year end exchange rates, the directors do not believe the fair value of the Groups borrowings to be materially different to the book values.
There have been no breaches of the terms of the loan agreements or defaults during the current or previous year.

Financial instruments and risk management The Group uses financial instruments to manage financial and commercial risk wherever it is appropriate to do so.
The main risks addressed by the financial instruments of the Group are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups policies in respect of the management of these risks, which remained unchanged throughout the year, were as follows: Market risk The Groups multi-national activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: Forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investments in overseas businesses which have currencies other than sterling as their functional currency.
Interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.
Forward currency structures to hedge the exchange risk arising on translation of the overseas business pro ts.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate uctuations arise.
Foreign currency exchange risk can be subdivided into two components, transactional risk and translation risk: Transactional risk: The Group policy is to hedge signi cant transactional currency exposures via the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The measurement and control of this risk is closely monitored on a Group-wide basis.
Translation risk: The Group translates overseas results and net assets in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 3.
The translation risk on net assets is mitigated by the transfer of currencies between Group companies and the appropriate use of foreign currency borrowings.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the year end are as follows: 2008 2007 US$ Euro NOK AUS$ US$ Euro NOK AUS$ Monetary assets million 83.9 55.0 32.6 5.3 62.6 32.3 33.1 3.7 Monetary liabilities million 168.2 105.0 45.6 1.1 81.4 101.3 35.0 0.6 Currency denominated net assets are partially hedged by currency borrowings.
The borrowings detailed below were designated as hedging instruments in net investment hedges.
2008 2007 US$ Euro NOK AUS$ US$ Euro NOK AUS$ Borrowings million 125.0 66.9 35.0 47.9 80.0 35.0 The Group uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the year end.
When necessary, forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.
The most signi cant exchange rate to manage as far as the Group is concerned is the sterling: US dollar exchange rate.

Financial instruments and risk management continued The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts for sales of foreign currencies outstanding as at 31 October: Average exchange rate Expiring within one year 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m US dollar 2.04 1.97 9.0 5.0 Euro 1.39 1.43 2.0 4.0 At the year end, there were two US dollar structures in place which were set up to protect the Income Statement from currency uctuations during 2008 and through to October 2010, and provide an economic hedge.
The structures involve a cap and a collar, which lock in the exchange rates and give the Group the appropriate protection.
However, these structures do not give linear relationships with the gain or loss from re-translation of future pro ts and hence hedge accounting has not been adopted.
At 31 October 2008, an 8.7 million loss is shown as an adjustment to underlying operating pro t and represents the fair value of the structures.
The signi cant change arises due to the sudden appreciation of the US dollar in the last month of the year.
The appreciation of the dollar has locked the structures into a xed rate of 1.855 on a currency amount of $66 million in the year to October 2009 and $36 million in the year to October 2010.
The principal amounts of the Groups Euro, NOK and US dollar bank loans and private placement have been accounted as net investment hedges on the European, Norwegian and US businesses.
These hedges are effective throughout the year and the losses arising on translation have been offset against the gains on retranslation of the subsidiaries in reserves.
Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash ows generated by the underlying operations of the Group.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into except for interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risks.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10 cent movement in the relevant foreign currencies against sterling.
10 cent represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 10 cent change in foreign currency rates.
A negative number indicates a decrease in pro t and equity where sterling weakens against the relevant currency.
US dollar impact Euro impact 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m Loss 7.8 0.7 3.5 3.8 Other equity 7.8 0.7 3.5 3.8 The Groups sensitivity to foreign currency has increased during the current year mainly due to the growth of the US and European subsidiaries.
These potential losses arising on the year end foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities would be more than offset by future translation and transaction gains.
In the managements opinion the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk as the year end exposure does not re ect the exposure during the year.
Interest rate risk The Group nances its operations through a mixture of retained pro ts, bank borrowings and leasing lines of credit.
The UK borrowings are denominated in sterling, Euro, US dollar and Norwegian Kroner and are subject to oating rates of interest linked to the Bank of Scotland base rate.
In order to protect against the risk of higher interest rates, the Group has entered into amortising interest rate swaps for the majority of its UK borrowings.
The overseas borrowings are denominated in local currency and are predominantly subject to xed rates of interest.
During the year the Group re nanced part of its Bank of Scotland borrowing facilities with a private placement of ten year xed interest loan notes in the US.
The new arrangement provides a natural hedge against the Groups investment structure in its US businesses.
The US loan notes are repayable in full in 2017.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Euro, NOK and sterling oating rate borrowings have interest rate swaps which mitigate the exposure arising on the oating rate debt and are all designated as cash ow hedges.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group does not have any signi cant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, based on prior experience and an assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivables consist of a relatively small number of customers spread across diverse geographical areas.
Customers are mainly multi national organisations or government agencies with whom the Group has long-term business relationships.
The majority of the Groups business is with the US Department of Defense and the UK Ministry of Defence and as such the credit risk on debtors is considered to be very low.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and when appropriate action is taken to minimise the credit risk to the Group.
The Groups price risk is principally in relation to the cost of raw materials and is not considered signi cant.
Price risk is managed through negotiations with suppliers and where appropriate the agreement of xed price supply contracts.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market con dence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group fide fines as total shareholders equity, excluding non-redeemable preference shares and minority interests, and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on the market prices.
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups share-based incentive schemes.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a speci c transaction basis by the Board.
The Group does not have a fide ned share buy-back plan.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Pensions continued In determining the pension liabilities the Group uses mortality assumptions which are based on published mortality tables.
For both the Staff Scheme and the Executive Scheme the actuarial table currently used is PA92 YOB MC 1.
The assumption considered to be the most signi cant is the discount rate adopted.
If the discount rate in the schemes were to change by 0.1% then it is predicted that the fide cit in the schemes would change by approximately 0.7 million.
The Group anticipates contributions to the fide ned bene t schemes for the year ending 31 October 2009 will be 1.7 million 2007: 1.7 million.
Self insurance The Group is self insured through its captive insurance company CHG Insurance Limited, based in Guernsey.
