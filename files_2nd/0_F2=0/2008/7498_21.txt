This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of subsidiary undertakings.
Included in the Company's trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 23,000 2007: nil which are past due at the reporting date for which the Company has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Company does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of receivables not impaired is 15 days 2007: 15 days.

The awards vest in two tranches, the first being between three and four years from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche.
The number of awards vesting is dependent upon the Profit Before Tax of the Group for the year ending 31 March 2008 and is subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 March 2009.

The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk The Companys exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Companys long term debt requirements with floating interest rates.
The Companys policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
To manage this, the Company enters into interest rate swaps, in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities is provided in the table overleaf.
Interest is payable on the banks overdraft and revolving credit facilities.
