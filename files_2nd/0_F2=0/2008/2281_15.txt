At 31 December 38.7 17.0 Carrying amount 141.6 213.0 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the business units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2008 2007 m m Heat Treatment 139.3 143.9 Hot Isostatic Pressing 2.3 1.6 Testing.
67.5 141.6 213.0 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for those calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the cash generating units.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash ows for all cash generating units is 9.4% 2007: 8.4%.
The recoverable amount is the sum of the discounted cash ows over a fifteen year period.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts based on management estimates for the next five years.
The expected sales reect management's expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle.
The expected profit margin reects management's experience of each cash generation unit's profitability at the forecast level of sales and incorporates the impact of the restructuring programme, where appropriate.
Cash ows after five years are based on an estimated growth rate of 3.1%, being the historical weighted average growth in GDP in the markets that the Group operates in.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Goodwill and tangible xed assets were impaired for heat treatment locations across the Group as a result of the current uncertain market conditions.
The most significant impairments were made in locations in France, Italy, Germany and North America.

Unguaranteed residual values of assets leased under finance leases at the balance sheet date are 1.1m 2007: 1.4m.
The interest rate inherent in the leases is xed at the contract date for the entire lease term.
The average effective interest rate contracted approximates to 4.5% 2007: 4.4%.
The fair value of the Groups finance lease receivables at 31 December 2008 is estimated at 1.1m 2007: 1.5m.
The lease receivables are secured on the related assets.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the supply of services of 8.4m 2007: 7.2m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identied loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash ows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Further disclosure of the Group's financial instrument risk management activities are set out in the Group Business Review on pages 3 to 12.
Included in the Group's trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 30.5m 2007: 44.5m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

Other financial assets continued In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a balance of 10.5m 2007: 9.0m.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected proceeds.

This unsecured facility commenced on 31 July 2006 for a period of seven years.
The Euro drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 0.80% and 1.10% above LIBOR the margin at 31 December 2008 was 0.9%.

Derivative financial instruments continued The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge material future transactions and cash ows.
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
The unrecognised gains and losses were not material either in 2008 or 2007.
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
At the balance sheet date the Group had entered into foreign currency denominated cross currency swaps that were designated as a hedging instrument for the purposes of hedging the translation of its foreign operations.
The contracts are entered into either with both currencies at oating interest rates generally based on 3 month LIBOR interest rates or both currencies at xed interest rates.

However at the balance sheet date the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2008 2007 m m Deferred tax liabilities 78.3 74.3 Deferred tax assets 52.5 29.7 25.8 44.6 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 115.0m 2007: 18.2m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 42.2m 2007: 16.7m of such losses, based on management forecasts of future taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 72.8m 2007: 1.5m of such losses.
All losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 601.9m 2007: 474.0m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignicant.

The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been 24.1m, comprising 0.9m in respect of benefit accrual, 2.2m in respect of ongoing deficit payments and 21.0m as a result of the sale of the Testing business.

Expected long-term rates of return The expected long-term return on cash is equal to bank base rates at the balance sheet date.
The expected return on bonds is determined by reference to UK long dated gilt and bond yields at the balance sheet date.
The expected rate of return on equities and property have been determined by setting an appropriate risk premium above gilt bond yields having regard to market conditions at the balance sheet date.
The 21m, paid in December 2008 as a result of the sale of the Testing business, is currently invested in Short-Term Treasury Bonds.
The Trustees are due to complete an investment strategy review in March 2009 after which it is likely that the 21m will be invested broadly in line with the rest of the fund.
As such, although this investment has been classed as Short-Term Treasury Bonds, the expected return for these assets represents an average of the current holding in Short-Term Treasury Bonds and the likely return on assets that will be held post the review in March 2009.
