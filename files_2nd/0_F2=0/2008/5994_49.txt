The principal fair value adjustments recorded on the acquisition of SMES relate to the recognition of intangible assets and the associated deferred tax liability.
SMES contributed 3,486,000 of revenue and 458,000 to the groups profit before tax for the period between the date of the acquisition and the balance sheet date.
Given the timing of the acquisition, had the acquisition been completed on the first day of the current financial period, this contribution, and consequently group revenues and group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent, would have been unchanged.
SMES is part of the Healthcare business segment.
Subsequent to the acquisition, the name of the company was changed from SMES to NRS Mobility Care Limited.
