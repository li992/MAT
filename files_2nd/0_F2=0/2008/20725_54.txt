GROUP COMPANY 000 2008 2007 2008 2007 Investments after gearing 2,809,497 2,605,530 2,821,912 2,617,669 Gearing 159,000 - 159,000 - Investments before gearing 2,650,497 2,605,530 2,662,912 2,617,669 Sensitivity analysis If net assets before gearing had decreased by 3% as at the reporting date, with all other variables held constant, the income statement and the net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent would have further decreased by the amounts shown below.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2007.
GROUP COMPANY 000 2008 2007 2008 2007 Income Statement Revenue return - - - - Capital return 4,770 - 4,770 - Net Assets 4,770 - 4,770 - A 3% increase in net assets before gearing would have resulted in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
24 Share Based Payments The Group operates three share based payment schemes.
All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP AESOP performance targets are set annually and dependent upon their achievement all employees may receive up to 3,000 of shares: this amount is pro rated for part time employees.
Individuals receive these shares free of all restrictions after a period of 5 years.
For the year to 31 January 2008 awards of 843.75 1,312.50 per person will be made.

Senior Management Equity Incentive Plan SMEIP The group formerly operated the SMEIP as a discretionary plan for executive directors and senior managers.
At least half of the participants annual bonus was applied to purchase shares in the Company to be held in an Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
A matching award over shares in the Company was made to the participant, with vesting at the end of the three year deferral period dependent upon the achievement of targets based on the total shareholder return TSR of the Company compared to a peer group of other investment trusts, and for senior managers but not Executive Directors individual performance targets.
Following approval of the new Long Term Incentive Plan in May 2007, no further awards will be made under the SMEIP.
However awards previously made remain subject to the rules of the SMEIP.
As part of the merger arrangements with The Second Alliance Trust PLC, participants in the 2005 SMEIP for that company were offered replacement matching awards in Alliance Trust PLC which are subject to the same terms and conditions as the awards that they replaced.
Further details can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report pages 46-53.
The prior year comparative figues in the following paragraph all refer to the SMEIP.
