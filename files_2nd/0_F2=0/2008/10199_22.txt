The prior year reorganisation costs relate to restructuring programmes carried out in Europe, the USA and at HAL Knowledge Solutions SpA.
Severance costs included within reorganisation costs are not included within staff costs disclosed in note 24.
In prior periods, the directors considered share-based compensation to be of an exceptional nature due to the accelerated payments made at the time of the Companys otation.
The directors have reviewed the classication and believe that on an on-going basis these costs are no longer exceptional in nature and have reclassied the expenditure accordingly.
The impact is to reduce exceptional items by $1.3 million 2007: $0.8 million.
All exceptional items relate to administrative expenses.

The directors have concluded that the Company has sufficient reserves to pay this dividend.
It has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.

Micro Focus International plc Annual report 2008 59 Consolidated financial statements and notes Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2008 9 Goodwill 2008 2007 $000 $000 Cost and net book amount At 1 May 2007 42,533 42,404 Acquisition note 28 23,321 129 Adjustment relating to prior years 70 At 30 April 2008 65,784 42,533 A segment-level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: North America 47,521 24,200 Europe and the Middle East 14,824 14,894 Rest of the world 3,439 3,439 At 30 April 2008 65,784 42,533 Details of the acquisition in the year are shown in note 28.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group's cash generating units CGUs which represent the operations of a country or, in more material operations, divisions within a country.
For each CGU the Group has determined its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
No impairment charge was required in the year 2007: $Nil and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date is $Nil 2007: $Nil.
The key assumption used in the impairment calculations is the forecast operating cash ows for the next five years based on approved budgets and plans.
These budgets and plans are based on past performance and expectations for the market development of the CGU.
In the case of the business relating to the acquisition of HAL Knowledge Solutions SpA in the prior financial year cash ows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 20%, which does not exceed the long-term estimate for the business in which the CGU operates.
The resulting cash ows were discounted using a post-tax discount rate of 8.9% 2007: 8.9%.
Sensitivity analysis as at 30 April 2008 has indicated that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the circumstances of the individual debtor.
Due to this, management believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
At 30 April 2008, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the short-term nature of the instrument.
At 30 April 2008, trade receivables of $7.8 million 2007: $8.9 million were past due but not impaired.
These relate to a large number of independent companies for whom there is no recent history of default.
The amounts are regarded as recoverable.
The average age of these receivables was 32 days in excess of due date 2007: 34 days.
As at 30 April 2008, trade receivables of $1.1 million 2007: $0.4 million were either partially or fully impaired.
The amount of the provision was $1.2 million 2007: $0.2 million.
The ageing of these receivables is as follows: 2008 2007 $000 $000 Three to four months 434 135 Over four months 692 223 Total 1,126 358 14 Cash and cash equivalents 2008 2007 $000 $000 Cash at bank and in hand 25,626 13,521 Short-term bank deposits 66,779 71,450 Total 92,405 84,971 The effective interest rate on short-term deposits was 2.8% 2007: 4.6% and these deposits have an average maturity of three days 2007: four days.
At 30 April 2008, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the instrument bearing interest at market rates and or the short-term nature of the instrument.

The Groups financial liabilities at 30 April 2008 are deemed to be equal to their fair value at that date.
Maturity of non-current borrowings The maturity prole of non-current borrowings is as follows: 2008 2007 $000 $000 Between one and two years 41 41 The effective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2008 2007 Finance lease obligations 8.5% The Groups other currency exposures comprise only those that give rise to net currency gains and losses to be recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures reect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
At 30 April 2008 and 30 April 2007, these exposures are immaterial to the Group.
Capital risk management The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benets for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet, plus net debt.
At 30 April 2008, the Group did not have net debt and therefore no gearing.
As outlined in note 30, borrowing facilities, the Company entered into a $40 million credit facility on 13 May 2008 which can be used for general corporate purposes.
