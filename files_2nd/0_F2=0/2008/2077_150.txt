6.8 Group performance The performance of the Group relative to the markets in which it operates over the past five years is illustrated by the two charts below.
The first compares our TSR performance with that of the ASX 100 and the FTSE 100, both of which are broadly-based indices.
The second illustrates performance against the LTIPs peer group index the relevant companies are listed in section 6.5.
The Committee believes that the broadly-based indices and the index of peer group companies are the most appropriate benchmarks for measuring our performance.
