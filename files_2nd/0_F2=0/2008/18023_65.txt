CAPITAL SHOPPING CENTRES PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2008 19.
Financial instruments Market Risk The group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the groups operations.
Market risk including interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Risk management is carried out by the group treasury department and the policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises of both cash flow and fair value risks: Cash flow interest risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates which expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
Bond debt and other capital market debt are generally at fixed rates.
The groups policy is to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
As a consequence, the group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate derivative financial instruments, as discussed in the financial review.
The below table shows the effects of interest rate swaps on the group borrowings profile of the group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2008 2008 2007 2007 m m m m Borrowings 75.0 2,685.4 94.5 2,429.0 Derivative impact 2,369.7 2,369.7 2,399.2 2,399.2 Net borrowings profile 2,444.7 315.7 2,493.7 29.8 The weighted average rate of interest rates contracted through interest rates swaps is 5.3 per cent 2007 5.3 per cent.

Financial instruments continued The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would be a positive movement of 59.8 million 2007 60.5 million in the fair value of derivatives.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would be a negative movement of 61.7 million 2007 62.6 million in the fair value of derivatives.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are dealt with in the income statement.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the above sensitivity analysis is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur.
Because the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by short-term floating rate debt, the overall effect on group cash flow of such a movement would be very small.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding swap agreements at 31 December 2008 is 2,369.7 million 2007 2,399.2 million.
b Market price risk The financial results are subject to movements in the value of underlying investment properties.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
Liquidity analysis is conducted to ensure that sufficient headroom is available to meet the groups operational requirements and committed investments.
The group treasury policy also includes maintaining adequate cash and marketable securities, as well as maintaining adequate committed facilities.
The groups policy is to seek to optimise its exposure to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest risk and to refinancing risk.
In effect the group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
At 31 December 2008, the maturity profile of group debt showed an average maturity of six years 2007 seven years.
The group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and seeks to avoid bunching of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by using a selection of maturity dates.
Re-financing risk may be reduced by re-borrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
The group will often pre-fund capital expenditure by arranging facilities or raising debt in the capital markets and then placing surplus funds on deposit until required for the project.
Efficient treasury management and strict credit control minimise the costs and risk associated with this policy which ensures that funds are available to meet commitments as they fall due.

Financial instruments continued The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve.

Credit risk is minimised by the review process conducted for potential tenants, in certain circumstances, deposits or guarantors are obtained for certain tenants.
The amount of deposits held at 31 December 2008 is 0.8 million 2007 2.5 million.
The amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
As at 31 December 2008, trade receivables of 13.6 million 2007 15.5 million were past due but not impaired.
These relate to customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows: Group Group 2008 2007 m m Up to three months 11.9 14.9 Three to six months 0.9 0.6 Greater than six months 0.8 - Trade receivables 13.6 15.5 Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is group policy to calculate any impairment specifically on each contract.
The group aims to mitigate the credit risk in liquid funds and derivative financial instruments by transacting with a number of institutions and the group aims to transact with counterparties that have a high percentage of tier one capital and strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.

Financial instruments continued Classification of financial assets and liabilities The table below sets out the groups accounting classification of each class of financial assets and liabilities, and their fair values at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
The fair values of quoted borrowings are based on the asking price.
The fair values of financial instruments are determined from observable market prices or estimated using appropriate yield curves at 31 December each year by discounting the future contractual cash flows to the net present values.
