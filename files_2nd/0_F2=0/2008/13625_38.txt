IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR GOODWILL Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs identified according to business segment.
A segment level summary of goodwill allocation is presented below.
2008 2007 Controls 7,240 5,839 Fluid Systems 17,490 8,513 Gears 8,062 7,175 32,792 21,527 The recoverable amounts of all CGUs are based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections and are based on actual operating results and the latest Group three year plan.
The three year plan is based on managements view of the future and experience of past performance.
Cash flows for the remainder of the next twenty years are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which reflects the long-term nature of many of the markets the Group serves.
This rate has been consistently bettered in the past so is believed to represent a prudent estimate.
A discount rate of 11.0%, being the Groups current weighted average cost of capital WACC, has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
The WACC has been used as management believe this to be the most appropriate and prudent rate for a market participant at the current date.
The discount rate of each business segment is not materially different to 11.0%.
On this basis each business segment has sufficient headroom and therefore no impairment write downs are required.
