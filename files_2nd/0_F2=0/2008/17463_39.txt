Financial statements and information annual report and accounts 2008 12 Taxation continued Factors affecting the current tax charge for the year The tax for the period is lower than 2007: higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28.5% being three months at a tax rate of 30% and the remaining nine months of the year at 28% 2007: 30%.
The differences are explained below: 2008 2007 000 000 Profit before tax 49,166 32,471 Profit before tax multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28.5% 2007: 30% 14,012 9,741 Changes in tax rates 38 1,402 Taxable overseas dividend income 118 243 Overseas losses not available for group relief 41 Utilisation of tax losses 2,081 357 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1,661 1,949 Tax in respect of prior years 685 967 Difference on foreign tax rates 558 145 Withholding tax written off 39 Tax charge for the year 13,621 11,946 Factors that may affect future tax charges Tax losses arising in previous years and other temporary differences total an estimated carried forward amount of 13,093,000 2007: 17,946,000 which, assuming a tax rate of 28% 2007: 28%, gives rise to an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 3,666,000 2007: 5,025,000.
As the respective Group undertaking in which these tax losses arise becomes profitable, future tax charges will be reduced as these tax losses are offset against the profits made.
However, no asset in relation to this has been recognised as there is insufficient certainty over the timing and availability of such future profits.
13 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of Xchanging plc and, for periods prior to 30 April 2007, the weighted average number of Xchanging BV shares having applied the same share for share exchange ratio as were applied to each class of Xchanging BV share on the acquisition of Xchanging BV by the Company on 30 April 2007.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in existence is adjusted to include all potential dilutive ordinary shares.
The Group has four types of potential dilutive ordinary shares: share options, share awards under the Performance Share Plan to the extent that the performance criteria for vesting of the awards are expected to be met, convertible debt and warrants.
Prior to listing on the London Stock Exchange, the warrants were exercised and the debt was converted into ordinary shares.
