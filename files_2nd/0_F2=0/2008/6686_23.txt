Pensions Non-rail schemes The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan For the majority of non-rail employees, the Group operates one main pension scheme, The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan the Go-Ahead Plan, which consists of a funded defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution section as follows: The defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is not contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and is open to new entrants.
The expense recognised for the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is 4.5m 2007 3.8m being the contributions paid and payable.
The defined benefit section of The Go-Ahead Plan is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and provides benefits based on a members final salary.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to this section are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The section is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result, it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future as a percentage of payroll.
However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.
The Go-Ahead Plan is a Group plan for related companies where risks are shared.
The overall costs of the Go-Ahead Plan have been recognised in the Groups financial statements according to IAS19.
Each of the participating companies accounts on the basis of contributions paid by that company.
The Group accounts for the difference between the aggregate IAS19 cost of the scheme and the aggregate contributions paid.
Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme and Southern Vectis Group Pension Scheme Employees of our Go South Coast operations participate in the Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme or the Southern Vectis Group Pension Scheme.
They are defined benefit schemes which are externally funded and contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme.
Contributions to the schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The plans are open to new entrants.
Other pension arrangements Employees of Meteor Parking and aviance have access to separate defined contribution pension arrangements.
The expense recognised for this is 0.4m 2007 0.4m, being the contributions paid.
The Railways Pension Scheme The majority of employees in our train operating companies are members of sections of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.
The RPS is a shared costs scheme, with assets and liabilities split 60% 40% between the franchise holder employee respectively.
The RPS sections are all open to new entrants and the assets and liabilities of each companys section are separately identifiable and segregated for funding purposes.
In addition to the defined benefit cost, brass matching AVC company contributions of 0.7m 2007 0.7m were paid in the year.
It is our experience that all pension obligations to the RPS cease on expiry of the franchises without cash or other settlement, and therefore the obligations recognised on the balance sheet under IAS19 are only those that are expected to be funded during the franchise term.
However, in spite of our past experience and that of other train operating companies proving otherwise, our legal obligations are not restricted.
On entering into a franchise, the operator becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the RPS scheme rules is obliged to meet the schedule of contributions agreed with the scheme trustees and actuaries, in respect of which no funding cap is set out in the franchise contract.
IAS19 would require the Group to account for its legal obligation under the formal terms of the RPS and its constructive obligation under the terms of each franchise agreement.
Following industry practice, the Group has concluded that the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the financial statements present fairly the Groups financial position, financial performance and cashflows, is to recognise its constructive but not its legal RPS defined benefit obligations.
In all other respects the Groups accounting policy is consistent with IAS19 and the treatment adopted for non-rail defined benefit schemes.
In doing so, the Group has applied the provisions of paragraph 17 of IAS1 and departed from the requirements of IAS19 Employee Benefits in order to achieve a fair presentation of the Groups obligations regarding its rail schemes and prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new franchise owner at exit.
The total surplus or deficit recorded is adjusted by way of a franchise adjustment, which is that portion of the deficit surplus projected to exist at the end of the franchise which the Group will not be required to fund benefit from.
