BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes on financial statements 26.
Investments in jointly controlled entities The significant jointly controlled entities of the BP group at 31 December 2008 are shown in Note 46.
The principal joint venture is the TNK-BP joint venture.
Summarized financial information for the groups share of jointly controlled entities is shown below.
In December 2007, BP signed a memorandum of understanding with Husky Energy Inc. Husky to form an integrated North American oil sands business.
The transaction was completed on 31 March 2008, with BP contributing its Toledo refinery to a US jointly controlled entity to which Husky contributed $250 million cash and a payable of $2,588 million.
In Canada, Husky contributed its Sunrise field to a second jointly controlled entity, with BP contributing $250 million in cash and a payable of $2,264 million.
Both jointly controlled entities are owned 50:50 by BP and Husky and are accounted for using the equity method.
During the year, equity-accounted earnings from these jointly controlled entities amounted to a loss of $70 million.
BP purchased refined products from the Toledo jointly controlled entity during the year amounting to $3,440 million.
In addition, BP purchased crude oil from third parties which it sold to the Toledo jointly controlled entity under an agency agreement.
The fees earned by BP for this service, and the total amounts receivable and payable at 31 December 2008 under these arrangements, were not significant.
BP will also purchase refinery feedstocks from the Sunrise jointly controlled entity once production commences, which is expected in 2013.
During 2008 the unwinding of discount on the payable to the Sunrise jointly controlled entity, included within finance costs in the group income statement, amounted to $103 million.
Our investment in TNK-BP will be reclassified from a jointly controlled entity to an associate with effect from 9 January 2009, the date that BP finalized a revised shareholder agreement with its Russian partners in TNK-BP, Alfa Access-Renova AAR.
The formerly evenly-balanced main board structure is replaced by one with four representatives each from BP and AAR, plus three independent directors.
The change in accounting classification from a jointly controlled entity to an associate reflects the ability of the independent directors of TNK-BP to decide on certain matters in the event of disagreement between the shareholder representatives on the board.
The group's investment will continue to be accounted for using the equity method.
Transactions between the group and its jointly controlled entities are summarized below.
