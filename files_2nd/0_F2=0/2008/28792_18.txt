The unrealised profits on such funds amounted to 1.0 million as at 31 March 2008 31 March 2007: 2.8 million.
The dealing subsidiary has tax losses amounting to 1.1 million at 31 March 2008 31 March 2007: 58.7 million.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses because of uncertainty as to the timing and magnitude of future taxable profits arising from the same trade.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of potential deferred tax on temporary timing differences associated with the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 0.5 million 31 March 2007: 0.6 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES CONTINUED Indemnity Provision In 1991 the Company acquired an investment in Newmont Mining and at the same time effected a disposal of its indirect interest in Cavenham Forest Industries Inc CFI.
As part of these arrangements the Company indemnified the purchaser of CFI against certain ongoing costs being incurred by that company.
The relevant indemnified costs are expected to be incurred between 2008 and 2027 and the indemnity provision has been based on the Companys share of the projected costs.
Investment Provision The Company owns several investments which were acquired under arrangements whereby part of the profit eventually realised on their disposal would be paid to certain third parties.
The provision has been computed by reference to the carrying value of the underlying investments.
Property The Group has a short leasehold interest in a property which is being sub-let to a third party.
The net income receivable is less than the annual outgoings and, based on a professional valuation, the Group has recognised a provision of 0.2 million as at 31 March 2008 31 March 2007: 0.2 million.
Long-term Incentive Plan This provision represents amounts accrued under a long-term incentive arrangement structured in the form of a Share Appreciation Rights Plan SAR.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, certain Directors and employees are entitled to a bonus calculated by reference to a notional number of shares in the Company.
The bonus amount payable would be equal to the increase, since the date of grant of the relevant SARs, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares, provided the relevant performance conditions are met: the provision also includes the corresponding employers national insurance liability.
The SAR can be exercised between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
The provision can be analysed by reference to the date of grant of the relevant SARs as set out below: 31 March 31 March 2008 2007 million million Date of grant 26 March 2003 2.3 1.9 31 March 2003 0.2 25 March 2004 0.1 0.1 30 March 2005 0.1 0.2 19 July 2005 1.0 0.7 31 August 2005 0.5 0.3 7 October 2005 0.1 15 March 2006 0.6 29 December 2006 15 March 2007 0.9 0.3 27 March 2008 0.1 Intrinsic value of all SARs 5.7 3.7 IFRS 2 adjustment to provision 0.1 0.1 Carrying amount of SAR provision 5.8 3.8 Intrinsic value of those SARs which had vested as at 31 March 2.5 2.2 The Company has used a binomial option valuation model to estimate the fair value of the SARs.
The inputs to the model included the following: expected volatility of 20%, dividends of 3.1p per share per annum, contractual life of ten years, and a risk-free interest rate of 4.5%.
Expected volatility has been estimated based on relevant historic data in respect of RITCPs share price.
The expected volatility and risk-free interest rate for the year ended 31 March 2007 were 18% and 5.4% respectively.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS As an investment trust, financial instruments make up the vast majority of the Groups financial position and generate its performance.
The Group holds investments in a variety of financial instruments in order to meet its investment objective to deliver long-term capital growth while preserving shareholders capital.
Asset allocation is determined by the executive Directors under the authority of the Board.
The assets and liabilities include the following financial instruments: investments including equity and non-equity shares, partnership interests and fixed income securities which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives.
The investments are designated at fair value through profit or loss FVPL : cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups investment activities: long-term borrowings used to enhance returns: and derivative transactions undertaken by the Group to manage market risks and currency risks.
The nature and extent of the financial instruments outstanding at the balance sheet date and the risk management policies employed by the Group are discussed below.

In relation to debtors, creditors and short-term borrowings the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The fair value of the term loans was estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
As at 31 March 2008 this amounted to 349.3 million 31 March 2007: 177.7 million.
No financial assets or liabilities were reclassified during 2008 or 2007 by the Group or the Company.
26.2 Financial Risk Management The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The identification, mitigation and monitoring of these risks is undertaken by the executive management under the authority of the Board and the Audit Committee, and is described in more detail below.
212016 RIT R&A pp65-pp87 29 5 08 19:31 Page 74 RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 74 26.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The objectives, policies and processes for managing risks have not changed since the previous accounting period.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole and it is at the Group level that the majority of the risk management procedures are performed.
Where relevant and materially different to the Group position, Company specific risk exposures are explained alongside those of the Group.
Market Risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three types of risk: Price Risk b. below The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk Interest Rate Risk c. below The risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates Currency Risk d. below The risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates Management of market risk Management of market risk is fundamental to the Groups investment objective and the investment portfolio is continually monitored to ensure an appropriate balance of risk and reward.
Exposure to any one entity is monitored by the executive Directors and senior management.
The Company complies with the requirement of the relevant tax legislation for an investment trust not to invest more than 15% of the total value of its investments in the securities of any one group at the time of the initial acquisition, or subsequent purchase.
From time to time, the Group may seek to reduce or increase its exposure to stock markets by taking positions in index futures and options relating to one or more stock markets.
These instruments are used for the purpose of hedging some or all of the existing exposure within the Groups investment portfolio to those particular markets or to enable increased exposure when deemed appropriate.
Price Risk Price risk other than caused by interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments held by the Group.
Management of price risk The executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to price risk and take appropriate action to mitigate the risk.
The Group has a widely diversified investment portfolio which significantly reduces the exposure to individual asset price risk.
Performance of third party investment managers is regularly reviewed and assessed to ensure compliance with their mandates and that their performance is compatible with the Groups investment objective.
Exposure to price risk The Groups exposure to pricing risk can be assumed to be equivalent to the investment portfolio, excluding interests in debt securities and including derivatives balances, as set out below: 31 March 31 March 2008 2007 million million Exposure to price risk 1,397.0 1,729.5 212016 RIT R&A pp65-pp87 29 5 08 19:31 Page 75 75 The Group progressively reduced its equity exposure during the year and increased its holdings in cash and other liquidity.
As at the year end, the Groups exposure to listed equities after adjusting for index futures and unquoted investments represented 66.8% of net assets 31 March 2007: 103.5%.
Price Risk Sensitivity Analysis The sensitivity of the Groups net assets and profit and loss in regard to changes in market prices is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 10% increase in the fair value of the investments and assumes all other variables are held constant.
A 10% decrease is assumed to produce an equal and opposite effect.
The sensitivity analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into in order to provide a hedge against such movements.
31 March 31 March 2008 2007 Impact on P L Impact on P L & Net Assets & Net Assets million million Total 108.8 163.7 c. Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations mainly through its share capital and retained profits, including realised gains on investments.
In addition, financing has been obtained through bank borrowings.
Changes in interest rates have a direct impact on the fair value or future cash flows of the following financial assets and liabilities Gilts and other government securities Money market funds Cash and cash equivalents Group borrowings Certain derivative contracts Changes in interest rates indirectly affect the fair value of the Groups investments in quoted and unquoted equity securities.
Management of Interest Rate Risk The executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making decisions on investments and borrowings.
The Company uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of future interest payments and this has the effect of increasing the proportion of its fixed interest debt.
Exposure to Interest Rate Risk The Groups exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set and fixed interest rates giving fair value risk, is shown below.
31 March 2008 31 March 2007 Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Rate Rate Total Rate Rate Total million million million million million million Portfolio investments debt securities 76.3 398.4 474.7 30.3 52.4 82.7 Cash 152.1 152.1 131.6 131.6 Bank loans and overdrafts: due within one year 23.4 75.5 98.9 151.1 151.1 due after more than one year 284.9 284.9 178.2 178.2 Total Exposure 205.0 38.0 243.0 10.8 125.8 115.0 212016 RIT R&A pp65-pp87 29 5 08 19:31 Page 76 RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 76 26.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the composition of the net assets of the Group arising out of investment, borrowing and risk management processes.
Portfolio investments include direct and indirect via external managed funds investments in government securities, money markets, and unquoted debt securities issued by portfolio companies.
Interest received on cash and cash equivalents is at prevailing market rates.
As mentioned above, the Group has increased its holdings of cash and cash equivalents as its holdings of equity positions were reduced.
The Group has total borrowings of 383.8 million outstanding at the year end 31 March 2007: 329.3 million.
All of the term loans, comprising 360.4 million of this total, incur fixed interest payments either as a result of the underlying obligation or through the operation of interest rate swaps.
Further details are provided in note 18.
The short-term facilities pay floating interest rates.
Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis The approximate sensitivity of the Groups net assets and profit and loss in regard to changes in interest rates is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 200 basis points annualised increase in prevailing interest rates at the balance sheet date applied to the floating rate assets and liabilities and the following assumptions: the fair values of assets and liabilities is not affected by a change in interest rates funds will be reinvested in similar interest bearing securities on maturity all other variables are held constant A 200 basis points decrease is assumed to produce an equal and opposite impact.
31 March 31 March 2008 2007 Impact on P L Impact on P L & Net Assets & Net Assets million million Total 4.1 0.2 d. Currency Risk Consistent with its investment objective, the Group invests in financial instruments and transactions denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
As such, the Groups profits and net assets could be significantly affected by currency movements.
Management of Currency Risk The Group enters into forward currency contracts as a means of limiting or increasing its exposure to particular currencies.
These contracts are used principally for the purpose of hedging the existing currency exposure of elements of the Groups portfolio as a means of reducing risk or to enable increased exposure when this is deemed appropriate.
Part of the Companys currency exposure in respect of its US Dollar, Euro and Yen investments is also hedged by way of the Companys long-term borrowings denominated in those currencies.

Currency Risk Sensitivity Analysis The sensitivity of the Groups net assets and profit and loss in regard to changes in key currencies is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 10% strengthening of the foreign currencies relative to Sterling as at 31 March, and assumes all other variables are held constant.
A 10% weakening is assumed to produce an equal and opposite effect.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the net foreign currency assets held at the balance sheet dates and takes account of forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.

Credit Risk Counterparty credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument held by the Group will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Group which could result in a loss to the Group.
Management of Credit Risk This risk is not considered significant and is managed as follows: The vast majority of the Groups transactions are settled on a delivery versus payment basis Using a large number of brokers.
Liquid investments cash and cash equivalents are divided between a number of different financial institutions.
The majority of the portfolio investments exposed to credit risk relate to government securities.
A credit exposure could arise in respect of derivative contracts entered into by the Group if the counterparty was unable to fulfil its contractual obligations.
The Group has exposure to certain debt instruments acquired as part of its private equity transactions.
The credit risk associated with these instruments is managed as part of the overall investment risk in the relevant portfolio companies and is not considered separately.
Exposure to Credit Risk The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March was: 31 March 31 March 2008 2007 million million Portfolio investments debt securities 398.3 82.7 Derivative financial instruments 43.3 25.9 Other receivables 18.5 6.1 Sales for future settlement 49.8 8.0 Cash at bank 152.1 131.6 Maximum exposure to credit risk 662.0 254.3 The majority of financial assets exposed to credit risk are the Groups liquidity balances which are mainly held by highly rated banks or in highly rated instruments.
Substantially all of the portfolio investments are held by Bank of New York Mellon as custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Groups rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed, however the custodians subordinated debt was rated A by Fitch in the most recent rating prior to 31 March 2008.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED f. Liquidity Risk Liquidity Risk is the risk that the Group will have difficulty in meeting its obligations in respect of financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group has significant investments in unquoted companies and private equity partnerships which are inherently illiquid.
In addition the Group holds investments with other third party organisations which may require notice periods in order to realise.
Management of Liquidity Risk The Group manages its liquid resources to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet all of its contractual commitments.
It monitors the level of short-term funding and balances the need for access to short-term funding with the long-term funding needs of the Group.
Exposure to Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is not viewed as significant as a substantial proportion of the Groups net assets are in liquid or readily realisable assets, which could be utilised to meet funding requirements if necessary.
The Company holds a significant proportion of its net assets in cash or cash equivalents.
In addition, the Company has the power, under its Articles of Association, to take out both short and long-term borrowings.

The notional amount of certain types of financial instruments provides a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but does not necessarily indicate the amount of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the derivatives.
The derivative instruments become favourable assets or unfavourable liabilities as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, indices, security prices or foreign exchange rates relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments on hand, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable and thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.

26.6 Capital Management The Groups primary objectives in relation to the management of capital are: to ensure its ability to continue as a going concern to maximise the long-term capital growth for its shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and gearing The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements: the Companys articles restrict borrowings to a cap of five times share capital and reserves, and additionally prohibit the distribution of capital profits as a dividend The Companys borrowings are subject to covenants limiting the total exposure based on a cap of borrowings as a percentage of adjusted net asset value.
All these conditions were met during this and the previous financial year.
212016 RIT R&A pp65-pp87 29 5 08 19:31 Page 83 83 In addition, one of the Companys subsidiaries is subject to capital requirements imposed by the Financial Services Authority and that subsidiary must ensure that it has sufficient capital to meet the requirements as set out by the Financial Services Authority.
The subsidiary was in compliance with those capital requirements throughout the year.
The Groups capital at 31 March comprises: 31 March 31 March 2008 2007 million million Equity share capital 154.8 156.2 Retained earnings and other reserves 1,535.2 1,479.4 Net asset value 1,690.0 1,635.6 Bank loans term loans 360.4 178.2 Total Capital 2,050.4 1,813.8 Debt as a % total capital 17.6% 9.8% There have been no significant changes to the Groups capital management objectives, policies and processes in the year, nor has there been any change in what the Group considers to be its capital.
PENSION COMMITMENTS J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited has pension commitments in respect of its participation in the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The Scheme has two parts: a defined benefit section which is closed to new members and money purchase arrangements which have been set up for Lord Rothschild.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Group has adopted the revised version of International Accounting Standard 19, Employee Benefits IAS 19, published in December 2004.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the income statement in the period in which they occur.
The retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of the Schemes assets as reduced by the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit method.
The employer contribution rate to the Scheme for the year ended 31 March 2008 was 47% of pensionable salaries 31 March 2007: 47%.
No changes have been made to this funding rate to date.
It is estimated that the contributions payable to the Scheme during the year ending 31 March 2009 will be 0.2 million 31 March 2008: 0.2 million.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the defined benefit scheme and the fair value of the assets held.
The full actuarial valuation of the scheme which was carried out as at 1 January 2005 was updated to 31 March 2008 by a qualified independent actuary.
The main financial assumptions are shown in the following tables: At At 31 March 31 March 2008 2007 Discount rate 6.00% 5.40% Rate of increase in salaries 4.25% 4.25% Rate of increase in payment of all pensions 4.00% 4.00% Inflation assumption 3.40% 3.20% The mortality assumptions employed as at 31 March 2008 are based on the tables set out below and include allowance for future improvements in life expectancy by projecting past improvement rates to calendar year 2030 for current active members and deferred pensioners, and to calendar year 2010 for current pensioners.
