these assets are carried at historical other 2,297.5 1,809.2 cost in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for intangible assets.
Total goodwill 9,093.2 6,071.7 the most significant of these is the Young & rubicam Group with a carrying value of 641.9 million at 31 December 2008 2007: 481.6 million.
the carrying values of the JWt, Hill & Knowlton and ogilvy & Mather Worldwide brands are not individually other goodwill represents goodwill on a large number of acquisitions, none of which is significant in comparison with the total carrying value of brands with an indefinite individually significant in comparison to the total carrying value of goodwill.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policy, the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
the carrying values of brands with an indefinite useful life are assessed for impairment purposes by using the royalty and loyalty methods of valuation, both of which utilise the net present value of future cash flows associated with the brands.
the 2008 goodwill impairment review was initially undertaken as at 30 June 2008 and then updated as at 31 December 2008. the review assessed whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of future cash flows, using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.5% and mangement forecasts for a projection period of up to five years, followed by an assumed annual long-term growth rate of 3.0% and no assumed improvement in operating margin.
Management have made the judgement that this long-term growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
In relation to the Young and rubicam Group, for impairment testing purposes, the methodology above indicated an amount of 775 million as the excess of recoverable amount over carrying value at 31 December 2008.
For an impairment charge to arise the actual cumulative annual growth in Young and rubicam cashflows over the next five years would have to be less than half the level assumed in the management forecasts over that period.
An impairment charge is required for both goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
Goodwill impairment charges of 84.1 million and 44.1 million were recorded in the years ended 31 December 2008 and 2007 respectively.
the impairment charges relate to certain under-performing businesses in the Group.
In certain markets, the impact of current local economic conditions and trading circumstances on these businesses was sufficiently severe to indicate impairment to the carrying value of goodwill.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, an impairment charge of 8.4 million 2007: 1.5 million was recorded in relation to acquired intangible assets.
this charge resulted from a decline in value of certain brands and customer relationships held within Branding & Identity, Healthcare and Specialist Communications.
