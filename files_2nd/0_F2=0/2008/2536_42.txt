Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised.
Instead it is subject to an impairment review at each reporting date in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
These reviews have been and will continue to be carried out at each reporting date or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment.
An agreement was reached in the prior year with the original vendors of Red Devil to pay an additional 3.0m deferred consideration.
Goodwill has been revised upwards to reflect a change in contingent consideration.
Payment will be made in instalments between August 2007 and September 2010.
In the prior year the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Britvic Ireland was provisional.
This has now been finalised.
Further detail on the acquisition can be found in Note 15.
