Our capital management program has three priorities: merger and acquisition activity.
To reinvest in our extensive pipeline of world-class projects that carry attractive rates of return regardless of the economic climate.

3.3 Key measures Our management and Board use a number of financial and operational measures to assess our performance.
Overall financial success We use several financial measures to measure the success of our overall strategy.
The two key measures are profit attributable to members of the BHP Billiton Group and Underlying EBIT.
Profit attributable to members of the BHP Billiton Group for FY2008 was US$15.4 billion, an increase of US$2.0 billion, or 14.7 per cent, from FY2007.
Underlying EBIT for FY2008 was US$24.3 billion compared with US$20.1 billion in FY2007, an increase of 21.0 per cent.
Underlying EBIT is the internally defined, key financial measure used by management for monitoring the performance of our operations.
We explain the calculations and why we use this measure in section 3.6.
Other measures in addition are as follows: 30 June 30 June 30 June 2008 2007 2006 1 Underlying EBIT margin 47.5% 48.4% 44.4% 1 Return on capital employed 37.5% 38.4% 36.6% Net operating cash flow US$M 18,159 15,957 11,325 1 Gearing 17.8% 25.0% 27.2% Basic earnings per share US cents 275.3 229.5 173.2 1 Refer to section 10 Glossary for definitions.

The FY2008 ratio has not changed since last year.
We continue to invest one per cent of our pre-tax profits on a three-year rolling average in community programs to ensure our host communities share in our success.
During FY2008, this voluntary investment totalled US$141 million, comprising cash, in-kind support and administration costs.
This is equivalent to 1.0 per cent of pre-tax profits, based on a three-year average of the profit before tax, as publicly reported in each of those years.
During the reporting period, our sites received 536 community complaints, a decrease from 543 during FY2007.
Similar to the previous reporting year, the most common type of community complaints were related to noise and dust.
World-class assets Our diversified and high-margin portfolio, with an abundance of tier one resources in fiscally stable regimes, provides us with an unique set of options to deliver growth.
In FY2008, annual production records were set in seven commodities and production increased in a further six.
This provides a stable platform as we continue to develop and deliver world-class projects that are expected to add significant shareholder value.
Actual production volumes for this year and the previous two years are shown below.
