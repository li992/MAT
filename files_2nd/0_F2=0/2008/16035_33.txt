PENSION ARRANGEMENTS Defined benefit scheme During the year, the Group operated a final salary scheme: the Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefit Scheme the TP scheme, th which is a 1 60 scheme.
The TP scheme is funded by contributions from group companies and employees.
Contributions are paid to the Trustees on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary who carries out a valuation of the scheme every three years.
Employees are entitled to start drawing a pension, based on their membership of the scheme, on their normal retirement date.
If employees choose to retire early and draw their pension, then the amount they receive is scaled down accordingly.
A full actuarial valuation of the TP scheme was carried out on 30 September 2005.
The IAS 19 valuation has been based upon the provisional results of the 30 September 2008 valuation, then updated to 31 December 2008 by a qualified actuary.
The present values of the defined obligations, the related current service costs and the past service costs for the scheme were measured using the projected unit method.
