accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
A Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 120 to 124.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 17 February 2009.
The financial statements are presented in the Companys functional currency of sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
In addition, certain comparatives have been restated to comply with the current years presentation.
Basis of measurement The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that investment properties and, from 1 January 2005, derivative financial instruments, financial instruments held for trading and financial instruments classified as available-for-sale, are stated at their fair value.
Hotel properties are stated at cost or deemed cost.
Deemed cost is calculated based on the hotels frozen valuation as at 1 January 2004.
Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The Groups income statement and segmental analysis separately indentifies headline operating profit, other operating income expense and impairment of the Group together with the other operating income expense, interest, tax and minority interest elements of its share of joint ventures and associates profit loss for the year.
This is in accordance with the IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the Group.
Headline operating profit may not be comparable to similarly fitted measures used by other companies.
The Directors intend to follow such presentation on a consistent basis in the future.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of the financial statement in conformity with Adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
Areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 32.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2008, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements: IASB IFRIC documents that have been endorsed IFRS 8 Operating Segments introduces the management approach to segmental reporting.
IFRS 8, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements, will require a change in the presentation and disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to access each segments performance and to allocate resources to them.
Currently the Group presents segment information in respect of its business and geographical segments see note 1.
Under the management approach, the Group will present segment information principally in respect of geographical segments in a similar way to the current presentation with additional information disclosed on EBITDA Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation.
Revised IAS 23 Borrowing Costs removes the option to expense borrowing costs and requires that an entity capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset.
The revised IAS 23 will become mandatory for the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements and will constitute a change in accounting policy for the Group.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Group will apply IAS 23 to qualifying assets for which capitalisation of borrowing costs commences on or after the effective date.
Therefore there will be no impact on prior periods in the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements, the impact on the 2009 financial year end is expected to be immaterial.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes addresses the accounting by entities that operate, or otherwise participate in, customer loyalty programmes under which the customer can redeem credits for awards such as free or discounted services.
IFRIC 13, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements, is not expected to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Revised IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements A Revised Presentation introduces the term total comprehensive income, which represents changes in equity during a period other than those changes resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as owners.
Total comprehensive income may be presented in either a single statement of comprehensive income effectively combining both the income statement and all non-owners changes in equity in a single statement, or in an income statement and a separate statement of comprehensive income.
Revised IAS 1, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements, is not expected to have a significant impact on the presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
70 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 71 accountInG poLIcIeS accountInG poLIcIeS Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment - Vesting Conditions and Cancellations clarifies the definition of vesting conditions, introduces the concept of non-vesting conditions, requires non-vesting conditions to be reflected in grant-date fair value and provides the accounting treatment for non-vesting conditions and cancellations.
The amendments to IFRS 2 will become mandatory for the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements, with retrospective application.
The Group has not yet determined the potential impact of the amendment.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction introduces a potential limit to the asset that is recognisable on the balance sheet if the plan were in surplus or require an additional liability to be recognised if the agreed contributions were expected to lead to an unrecognisable surplus emerging in the future.
Following endorsement by the EU in mid-December 2008, IFRIC 14 will become mandatory for the year ending 31 December 2009, and is not expected to have any impact on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2009, this is because the Groups position on defined benefit plans that are in deficit is expected to remain and the current schedule of future contributions is not expected to create a surplus.
IASB IFRIC documents not yet endorsed as at 31 December 2008 Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation requires puttable instruments, and instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation, to be classified as equity if certain conditions are met.
The amendments, which become mandatory for the Groups 2009 consolidated financial statements, with retrospective application required, are not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2008 incorporates the following changes that are likely to be relevant to the Groups operations: T he definition of a business has been broadened, which is likely to result in more acquisitions being treated as business combinations.
Contingent consideration will be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes therein recognised in profit or loss.
T ransaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred.
Any pre-existing interest in the acquiree will be measured at either fair value, or at its proportionate interest in the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree, on a  basis.
Revised IFRS 3, which will become mandatory for the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements, will be applied prospectively and therefore there will be no impact on prior periods in the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements.
Amended IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 2008 requires that accounting for changes in ownership interests by the Group in a subsidiary, while maintaining control, to be recognised as an equity transaction.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, any interest retained in the former subsidiary will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
The amendments to IAS 27, which will become mandatory for the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements, are not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
B Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to control, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from their activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Joint ventures and associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence but not control over the financial and operating policies.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates and joint ventures on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence or joint control respectively commences until the date that it ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate or joint venture, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of joint venture partners and associates.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
72 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 73 accountInG poLIcIeS accountInG poLIcIeS C Foreign currency i Foreign currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the foreign exchange rate at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss.
iii Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of related hedges are taken to translation reserve.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal of the foreign operation.
D Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
E Hedges i Cash flow hedges When a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, then the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, then the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities When a derivative financial instrument is used as an economic hedge of the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, hedge accounting is not applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
iii Hedge of net investment in foreign operation The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity within translation reserve.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
72 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 73 accountInG poLIcIeS accountInG poLIcIeS F Property, plant, equipment and depreciation i Recognition and measurement Land and buildings other than investment properties are stated at cost, except as allowed under IFRS 1 transition rules, less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Any impairment of such properties below depreciated historical cost is charged to the income statement.
Under the transition provisions of IFRS 1, land and buildings which were previously revalued under UK GAAP are measured on the basis of their deemed cost, being their UK GAAP carrying value, including revaluations, as at 1 January 2004. ii Reclassification to investment property Property that is being constructed for future use as investment property is accounted for as property, plant and equipment until construction or development is complete, at which time it is remeasured to fair value and reclassified as investment property.
Any gain or loss arising on remeasurement is recognised in profit or loss.
iii Depreciation Freehold land is not depreciated.
All other assets are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Building core 50 years or lease term if shorter Building surface, finishes and services 30 years or lease term if shorter Plant and machinery 15 20 years Furniture and equipment 10 years Soft furnishings 5 7 years Computer equipment 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years No residual values are ascribed to building surface finishes and services.
Residual values ascribed to building core depend on the nature, location and tenure of each property.
iv Subsequent costs Capital expenditure on major projects is recorded separately within property, plant and equipment as capital work in progress.
Once the project is complete the balance is transferred to the appropriate fixed asset categories.
Capital work in progress is not depreciated.
Interest attributable to funds used to finance the construction or acquisition of new hotels or major extensions to existing hotels is capitalised gross of tax relief and added to the cost of the hotel core.
Operating supplies, which include china, linen, glass and silverware, are stated at their deemed costs as at 1 January 2008 and subsumed into the costs of the hotel buildings.
Subsequent renewals and replacements of such stocks and new supplies upon initial hotel opening are written off as incurred to the income statement.
G Leases i Leased assets Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
The leased asset is initially recorded at the lower of fair value and the present value of minimum lease payments.
The equivalent liability, categorised as appropriate, is included within current or non-current liabilities.
Assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful economic lives.
Finance charges are allocated to accounting periods over the period of the lease to produce constant rates of return on the outstanding balance.
Rentals payable by the Group under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term even if payments are not made on the same basis.
In cases where rents comprise a fixed and a variable element, the fixed element only is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis with the variable amounts being charged as they become due.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Rentals receivable by the Group as lessor under operating leases, including the sub-letting of retail outlets within hotel properties, are credited to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term even if the receipts are not made on such a basis.
Costs, including depreciation incurred in earning the lease income are recognised as an expense.
74 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 75 accountInG poLIcIeS accountInG poLIcIeS ii Lease premium On occasion the Group makes and receives initial payments on entering into both long and short leases of land and buildings.
As leases of land are normally classified as operating leases if title is not expected to pass, the element of the payment attributable to land is recorded on the balance sheet as lease premium prepayment and is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Interest attributable to funds used to finance the purchase of leases of land is capitalised gross of tax relief and added to the cost of the lease prepayments.
In the case of lease premiums received, these are reflected on the balance sheet as deferred income, appropriately classified between current and non-current liabilities and are credited to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
H Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than investment properties, inventories, employee benefit assets and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
Where permissible under IFRS, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment had been recognised.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in fair value of the asset below its cost is considered in determining whether the asset is impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
I Investment properties Investment properties held by the Group are properties which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment properties are stated at fair value.
Any increase or decrease in the fair value on annual revaluation is recognised in the income statement in accordance with IAS 40: Investment Property.
An external, independent valuation company, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued, values the portfolio annually.
The fair values are based on market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
The Groups associate undertaking, CDLHT, holds hotel assets which are leased to both the Group and external third parties with lease rentals and related charges varying according to the agreements involved.
For the purposes of the preparation of the Groups financial statements, to the extent that these assets held by CDLHT qualify to be accounted for as investment properties in accordance with IAS 40, the Group equity accounts for its share of CDLHTs fair value change within its overall share of profits from associates.
Such share of fair value change is recorded as a share of other operating income expenses of associates in the Groups income statement.
Where in the Groups view, the indicators of the lease arrangement are of an owner-occupied property, the property is accounted for in the Groups financial statements as part of CDLHTs property, plant and equipment with the Groups share of CDLHTs results for the period incorporating an appropriate depreciation charge.
J Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
K Development properties Development properties are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are held-for-sale in the short-term and are therefore classified as current assets.
The cost of development properties includes interest and other related expenditure incurred in order to get the asset ready for its intended use.
L Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
74 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 75 accountInG poLIcIeS accountInG poLIcIeS M Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
N Income tax Income tax on profit or loss comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: i the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and ii differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only to the extent that: i the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities: ii the Group intends to settle net: and iii the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
O Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement.
ii Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses within the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense in the period in which they occur.
iii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than post-employment plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
iv Share-based payment transactions The share-based incentive schemes allow Group employees to acquire shares of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc.
The fair value of options and awards granted are recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to exercise options granted or for share awards to vest.
The fair value of the share awards or grants are measured using a stochastic model, taking into account the performance conditions applying to the share options and awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
76 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 77 accountInG poLIcIeS accountInG poLIcIeS P Provisions A provision is recognised on the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
Q Revenue and its recognition Revenue comprises: Income from the ownership and operation of hotels recognised at the point at which the accommodation and related services are provided: Management fees earned from hotels managed by the Group, usually under long-term contracts with the hotel owner.
Management fees include a base fee, which is generally a percentage of hotel revenue, and or an incentive fee, which is generally based on the hotels profitability: recognised when earned on an accrual basis under the terms of the contract: Franchise fees received in connection with licensing of the Groups brand names, usually under long-term contracts with the hotel owner.
The Group charges franchise royalty fees as a percentage of room revenue: recognised when earned on an accrual basis under the terms of the agreement: REIT managers management fees earned from CDLHT and recognised on an accrual basis based on the applicable formula as described in note 30: Income from property rental recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term, lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income: and Land, development property and property sales recognised when legal title transfers provided the related significant risk and rewards of ownership have passed by that date.
R Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are appropriately authorised and approved for payment and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
S Segment reporting The Groups primary reporting format is two business segments, hotel and property operations, with each segment representing a business unit that offers different products and serves different markets.
The hotel operations comprise income from the ownership and management of hotels.
Property operations comprise the development and the sale of land and development properties and investment property rental income.
The Groups secondary reporting format is geographic location.
The hotel and property operations are managed on a worldwide basis and operate in six principal geographical areas: New York, Regional US, London, Rest of Europe, Asia and Australasia.
T Non-current assets held-for-sale Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held-for-sale.
Generally the assets or disposal group are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to property, plant and equipment and lease premium prepayment, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets and investment property, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement.
Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
U Other financial assets and liabilities Trade investments are classified as available-for-sale assets and are included under non-current assets within other financial assets.
They are recorded at market value with movements in value taken to equity.
Any impairment to value is recorded in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount discounted if material less impairment.
Trade and other payables are stated at their nominal amount discounted if material.
V Related parties For the purpose of these financial statements, parties are considered to be related to the Group if the Group has the ability directly or indirectly, to control the party or exercise significant influence over the party making financial and operating decisions, or vice versa, or where the Group and the party are subject to common control or common significant influence.
Related parties may be individuals or other entities.

Completion of the proposed disposal was expected to take place on 30 September 2008 and subsequently agreed to be deferred to 28 November 2008.
While the Group was ready, willing and able to complete the disposal, the buyer was unable to finalise its financing arrangements and, consequently, the agreement for the disposal was terminated.
The non-refundable cash deposit paid by the buyer has resulted in the Group recording a 31.4 gain net of 2.0m expenses.
The difference between the gain of 31.4m and the 27.3m net cash proceeds received is due to the effect of foreign currency translation.
b I n 2007, following protracted negotiations, a 1.0m property tax accrual in the US set aside on the acquisition of Regal Hotels in 1999 was released.
c I n 2007, the Group sold a small number of stapled securities in CDLHT that gave rise to a 0.7m gain.
d I n 2007, the 2.0m dilution gain arising on the Investment in CDLHT followed the Groups subscription to a rights issue of shares at a discount together with the non-participation in an S$32.8m 10.6m private placement issue, the effect of which marginally diluted the Groups investment In CDLHT.
e T here was no revaluation surplus recorded for the Groups investment properties in 2008.
In 2007, the Tanglin Shopping Centre Singapore recorded an uplift in value of 8.7m.
f In 2006 the Group sold three of its Singapore hotels on a sale and leaseback arrangement to CDLHT.
The additional 1.4m profit which arose in 2007 was the result of releasing accruals that were no longer required on capital expenditure relating to those assets.
IMPAIRMENT 2008 2007 Notes m m Impairment Joint venture investments and loans a 19.6 Hotels b 8.1 7.0 Other property c 7.4 35.1 7.0 a Joint ventures investments and loans The Groups 30% and 50% investments in Beijing and Bangkok respectively have been fully written down by an aggregate of 19.6m and comprise 12.2m investments and a 7.4m provision for loans.
This follows a review of the difficult economic conditions and over supplied hotel situation in Beijing post the Olympics and the unstable political conditions affecting business in Thailand.
b Hotels The Directors undertook an annual review of the carrying value of the hotels and property assets for indications of impairment and where appropriate external valuations were also undertaken.
An impairment charge of 8.1m 2007: 7.0m has been recorded and relates to 6 hotels in US and UK as well as land in India.
c Other property The Group formerly operated the Four Points Sunnyvale Hotel California, USA and in 2006, a decision to redevelop into a new hotel and residential apartments led to the closure of the hotel operations.
Accordingly, in that year, the Group transferred the redevelopment of Sunnyvale from property, plant and equipment to development properties.
In 2007, with the uncertainties in the US property market, the Directors then made a write-down of 9.6m to the carrying value of the property, which was classified within the headline operating profit.
In December 2008, in view of the continued uncertainties of the US property market, the Group changed its intent from the aforesaid to holding the hotel component of the Sunnyvale site when completed for its own operations, and to holding the residential component when completed to be leased out to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
Accordingly, transfers have been made from development properties into property, plant and equipment.
An impairment charge of 7.4m has been made on reclassification based on an external professional valuation obtained.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE CREDIT 2008 2007 m m Current tax Corporation tax charge for the year 27.8 20.2 Adjustment in respect of prior years 5.0 4.0 32.8 16.2 Deferred tax note 23 Origination and reversal of timing differences 0.9 5.3 Reduction in tax rate 4.2 3.9 Benefits of tax losses recognised 2.3 2.7 Over provision in respect of prior years 8.4 9.5 Change in UK tax legislation in respect hotel tax allowance see note below 10.3 12.9 Total deferred tax credit 0.9 18.3 Total income tax expense credit in income statement 31.9 2.1 UK 14.5 13.5 Overseas 17.4 11.4 Total income tax expense credit in income statement 31.9 2.1 Excluding the tax relating to joint ventures and associates, the Group has recorded a tax expense of 31.9m 2007: 2.1m tax credit.
This increased tax expense is primarily attributable to the differing impact of non-recurring adjustments relating to prior years, in particular the deferred tax impact of a series of changes in legislation relating to UK hotel allowances.
The removal of claw back of such allowances gave rise to an estimated deferred tax credit of 12.9m in 2007, whereas the subsequent reduction in tax base arising from legislation passed in 2008 in respect of the phased abolition of such allowances has given rise to a tax charge in 2008 of 10.3m.
A tax charge of 2.8m 2007: 1.4m relating to joint ventures and associates is included in the reported profit before tax.
Major adjustment factors affecting the 2008 tax expense: Effect of lower tax rates on other operating income There is no tax expense on the 31.4m gain from the aborted sale of CDL Hotels Korea Limited.
Effect of changes in tax rates The credit of 4.2m relates to reductions in tax rate in the USA, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Adjustments in respect of prior years The Groups tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
The geographical complexity of the Groups structure makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and it is often dependent on the efficacy of the legal processes in the relevant tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

a Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
Exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis, credit checks being performed on all clients requiring credit over certain amounts.
Credit is not extended beyond authorised limits, established where appropriate through consultation with a professional credit vetting organisation.
Credit granted is subject to regular review, to ensure it remains consistent with the clients current credit worthiness and appropriate to the anticipated volume of business.

c Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The primary objectives of the treasury function are to provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the Group and to identify and manage financial risks, including exposure to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates arising from those activities.
If appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks, as set out below: i Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on revenue, purchases, borrowings and cash deposits denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective Group entities.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Singapore dollars, New Zealand dollars, Australian dollars, New Taiwan dollars and Korean won.
The Groups principal policy, wherever possible, is to maintain a natural hedge whereby liabilities are matched with assets denominated in the same currency.
Foreign currency investment exposure is also minimised by borrowing in the currency of the investment.
To mitigate foreign currency translation exposure, an appropriate proportion of net assets is designated as hedged against corresponding financial liabilities in the same currency.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans during each accounting period are recognised as a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge is effective.
The foreign exchange exposure arising on the Groups net investment in its subsidiaries is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the exposure arising on the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
Foreign currency translation exposure is primarily managed through funding of purchases from operating income streams arising in the same currency.
Hedging of transaction exposure is undertaken with approved counterparties and within designated limits, using spot or short-term forward contracts to buy or sell the currency concerned, once the timing and the underlying amount of exposure have been determined.
Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge specific transaction exposure where appropriate.
As at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 no such contracts were in place.

ii Interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of ongoing review of its exposure to changes in interest rates on its borrowings, taking into account market expectations with regard to the perceived level of risk associated with each currency, the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt, and the extent to which debt may potentially be either prepaid prior to its maturity or refinanced at reduced cost.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mixture of its financial liabilities on a fixed and floating-rate basis with a greater emphasis on floating rates presently as this flexibility is being considered to be appropriate in the context of the Groups overall geographical diversity, investment and business cycle and the stability of the income streams, cash balances and loan covenants.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost is considered to outweigh the benefit from the flexibility of variable rate borrowings.
The Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives.
Where used, interest rate derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value within the Groups balance sheet.
As at 31 December 2008 no interest rate derivatives were in place 2007: nil.

Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
For interest rate swaps bank valuations are used.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for similar lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair value Prevailing market interest rates are used to discount cash flows to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PENSION ARRANGEMENTS The Group operates various funded pension schemes which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
The most significant funds are described below: United Kingdom The Group operates a pension scheme the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan for its UK employees, which was set up in 1993.
The scheme is a funded defined benefit arrangement with different categories of membership.
During 2008, as appointed by the Trustees of the Plan, Russell Investments Ltd formerly known as The Frank Russell Company Limited and Legal and General Investment Management Limited were the investment managers of the Plan.
The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group.
The contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 6 April 2005 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2008.
The contributions of the Group during the year were 20.5% of pensionable salary, plus enhanced contributions of 1.1m per annum to remove the Plans deficit.
At the date of these accounts the valuation as at 6 April 2008 was not finalised.
As the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to mortality, the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
Korea The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Korea.
The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2008.
The contributions of the Group were 8.8% 2007: 10.9% of the employees earnings.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and rate of increase in salaries.
Taiwan The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan.
The contributions of the Group were 6% 2007: 6% of the employees earnings.
The assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions: 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 UK Korea Taiwan UK Korea Taiwan Inflation rate 3.1% 2.5% 3.20% 2.50% Discount rate 6.5% 7.75% 2.75% 5.90% 7.00% 2.75% Rate of salary increase 3.6% 5.0% 3.0% 3.70% 5.00% 3.00% Rate of pension increases 3.1% 3.20% Annual expected return on plan assets 7.5% 5.0% 2.75% 7.24% 5.00% 2.75% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not be necessarily borne out in practice.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain.
The expected annual return on UK plan assets for 2008 of 7.5% has been calculated using an 8.0% return on equity representing 66.7% of plan assets and a 6.5% return on bonds representing 33% of plan assets.
The discount rate used in respect of the UK pension scheme of 6.5% 2007: 5.90% was based on the yield of the Merrill Lynch over-15 year AA rated corporate bond index.

Details of these schemes are given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policy O iv, on share-based payment transactions, the fair value of share options and long-term incentive awards are recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the share options and long-term incentive awards.
The charge to the income statement in the year was 1.1m 2007: 0.8m.
The Group applied IFRS 2 to its active employee share-based payment arrangements at 1 January 2005 except for equity-settled employee sharebased payment arrangements granted before 7 November 2002.
The Group has granted employee equity-settled share-based payments in 2006, 2007 and 2008.
The adoption of IFRS 2 is equity neutral for equity-settled transactions.

In relation to 1.9m charged to reserves in 2008, there is a 0.3m charge relating to defined benefit pension schemes and a 1.6m charge relating to share-based payment arrangements.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when deferred taxes relate to the same taxation authority.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.

Note CDL Hospitality Trusts is a stapled group comprising CDL Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust H-REIT, a real estate investment trust, and CDL Hospitality Business Trust HBT, a business trust.
H-REIT has an investment strategy of investing directly or indirectly, in a diversified portfolio of income-producing real estate which is primarily used for hospitality and or hospitality-related purposes, whether wholly or partially, and real-estate related assets in relation to the foregoing.
HBT is a business trust which is dormant.
It exists primarily as a master lessee of last resort and will become active if H-REIT is unable to appoint a master lessee for any of the hotels in its portfolio at the expiry of the relevant master lease agreement or for a newly acquired hotel.
HBT may also become active if it undertakes certain hospitality and hospitality-related development projects, acquisitions and investments which may not be suitable for H-REIT.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS Management discussed, with the Audit Committee Board, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the year.
The Group evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.
Such estimates and judgements are based upon historical experience and other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Certain critical accounting policies, among others, affect the Groups more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Actual results could differ from the Groups estimates and assumptions.
Key estimates and judgements have been made in the following areas: Going concern For the last several years the Group has had a history of profitable operations and ready access to financial resources, and in general, management concluded that the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate without detailed analysis.
However, given the current uncertain economic conditions which include recessionary pressures that have an impact on the Groups revenues, operating costs and profitability, management have estimated a wide range of factors relating to current and expected profitability, have considered sensitivities around potential trading levels and covenant compliance, reviewed debt repayment schedules, and potential sources of replacement financing before they can satisfy themselves that the going concern basis is appropriate.
Asset carrying values Management perform an assessment at each balance sheet date of all material assets across the Group for signs of impairment.
Key judgement areas include the carrying values of land and buildings, investments in and loans to associates and joint ventures, development properties and trade receivables.
The recovery of these assets is dependent on future cash flows receivable and the provision of future services or goods by third parties.
A full impairment review has been performed of all property, plant and equipment, lease premium prepayments and investments in and loans to joint ventures and associates held across the Group on a cash generating basis.
Where appropriate, external evaluations are also undertaken.
The impairment review is performed on a value in use basis which requires estimation of future net operating cash flows, the time period over which they will occur, an appropriate discount rate and appropriate growth rates.
The discount rates used reflect appropriate sensitivities involved in the assessment.
Discount rates used for impaired properties are disclosed in note 9.
Defined benefit pension plans The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension plans.
As set out in note 20, the calculation of the present value of the Groups defined benefit obligations at each period end is subject to significant estimation.
An appropriately qualified, independent actuary is used to undertake this calculation.
The assumptions made by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The valuation of scheme assets is based on their fair value at the balance sheet date.
As these assets are not intended to be sold in the short-term, their values may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
In reviewing the work of the independent actuary, management were required to exercise judgement to satisfy themselves that appropriate weight had been afforded to macroeconomic factors.
Details of the assumptions used are set out in note 20.

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS CONTINUED Taxation The Group has, from time-to-time, contingent tax liabilities arising from trading and corporate transactions.
After taking appropriate external professional advice, the Group makes provision for these liabilities based on the probable level of economic loss that may be incurred and which is reliably measureable.
Investment in CDLHT In 2006 the Group acquired a 39.1% interest in CDLHT, a stapled security listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited, comprising a hotel real estate investment trust REIT and a business trust.
The business trust is dormant.
The Groups interest in CDLHT at 31 December 2008 was 39.0%.
CDLHT is not considered to be a special purpose entity under Standing Interpretations Committee 12: Consolidation Special Purpose Entities and the Group does not have, by virtue of its unit holdings, the power to control a majority of the voting rights of the units of CDLHT.
However, as further noted in note 30, the Group acts as REIT Manager through a wholly owned company, under the terms of the trust deed constituting the REIT.
The Directors have therefore given careful consideration to the Groups interest in and relationship with CDLHT for the purposes of assessing whether it should be consolidated in accordance with IAS 27: Consolidation and Separate Financial Statements.
A subsidiary of the Group, M&C REIT Management Limited, in its capacity as REIT Manager, has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the REIT.
However, there are certain substantive kick-out rights that prevent the Group from exercising the power to control the majority of the Board of the REIT Manager so as to be able to govern the financial and operating policies of the REIT.
Management have judged that the Group does not therefore control CDLHT and it is not a subsidiary of the Group.
Because of the significant influence that the Group has by way of its holding of 39.0% of CDLHT units and representation on the Board of the REIT Manager, the Group equity accounts for its interest in CDLHT as an associate.
Lease backs from CDLHT As part of the transactions with CDLHT in 2006, the Group entered into sale and lease back arrangements in respect of three hotels in Singapore.
As further explained in note 30 the Group entered into 20 year leases with CDLHT for each of the hotel buildings with variable rent based on the hotels performance but subject to a fixed minimum rental, and with an option granted to the Group to renew for a further 20 years on the same rental terms.
Although the Group has the option to lease the building assets for a total of 40 years, there remains a substantial proportion of the assets economic lives for which the Group will not benefit from the assets.
In addition, the present value of the minimum lease payments for the 40-year potential term of the three leases do not constitute substantially all of the fair value of the leased assets, and the variable rent structure is such that the Group does not retain significant risks and rewards of ownership of the assets.
Accordingly, the Group has classified the lease back arrangements as operating leases in accordance with IAS 17: Leases.
In addition, the Groups lease of the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel from CDLHT as part of the 2006 transactions entered with CDLHT has also been similarly accounted for by the Group as an operating lease for the same reasons noted above.
Investment property The Group holds a number of investment properties and accounts for such properties in accordance with the accounting policy set out on page 75.
CDLHT owns hotel assets which are leased to both the Group and external third parties with lease rentals and related charges varying according to the agreement involved.
The Group accounts for such hotel assets in its financial statements in accordance with the accounting policy set out on page 74.
Judgement is required in assessing whether the relevant hotel assets held by CDLHT are owner-occupied or not, for the purposes of assessing whether IAS 40, Investment Property is applicable and whether therefore, accounting for the relevant hotels as investment properties is appropriate for the purposes of the Groups financial statements.
The question of whether or not a property is owner-occupied is a matter of judgement, involving consideration of various factors such as, the length of the agreement involved, the powers of intervention and level of influence on financial and operating decisions held by the Group or CDLHT, and the extent of the Group or CDLHTs interest in the profits and cash flows generated by the relevant properties.
Where the indicators are such that on balance, CDLHT is, in the Groups opinion, shown to be a passive investor, the relevant hotel property is accounted for in accordance with IAS 40 and the Group accounts for its share of the fair value change through the income statement as a share of other operating income expense of the associate.
Where indicators are of an owner-occupied property, the hotel is classified as part of CDLHTs property, plant and equipment with the Groups share of CDLHTs results for the period incorporating an appropriate depreciation charge.

Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which assumes that the Company will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 Related Parties and has, therefore, not disclosed transactions with Group entities.
Accounting convention and basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The profit after tax dealt with in the accounts of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc, determined in accordance with the Act was 20.4m 2007: 6.8m.
Under Financial Reporting Standard No 1 revised, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement as its cash flows are included within the published consolidated cash flow statement of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc.
Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Companys profit and loss account.
Cash and liquid resources Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand less overdrafts payable on demand.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Except as otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences, which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences arise when items on income and expenditure are included in tax computations in periods different from their inclusion in the financial statements.
Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The Company uses a fair value hedging model to designate bank loans and bonds held in overseas currencies as hedging instruments against designated overseas investments held in the same currency.
Under such fair value hedges, both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are retranslated with the exchange differences in both cases being recorded in the profit and loss account as they arise at each period end.
Share-based payment FRS 20 requires that the fair value of share options granted to employees be recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
However, during the current and prior year, the Company had no employees and only issued share options to employees of its operating subsidiaries.
Consequently, no profit and loss change has been recorded in the current or prior year.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are appropriately authorised and approved for payment and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the financial statements.

The Company had no employees.
Details of share options issued by the Company are given in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and note G. The Company is the principal employer of the UK Group pension scheme, the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan, which provides benefits based on final pensionable pay.
As the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, the scheme has been accounted for, in these financial statements as if it were a defined contribution scheme as permitted by FRS 17 Retirement benefits.
Details of the plan are given in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
C DIVIDENDS Details of dividends paid and proposed in the current and prior year are given in note 25 to the Group financial statements.
