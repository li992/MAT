The inputs into the stochastic model are as follows: 2008 2007 Performance Performance Share Plan Share Plan Weighted average share price 696.0p 881.0p Weighted average exercise price 0.0p 0.0p Expected volatility 38.2% 28.10% Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk free rate 3.95% 5.24% Expected dividend yield 2.59% 1.77% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous six years, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
