Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2008 were authorised for issue by the Board on 17 November 2008.
Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited company incorporated and registered in England.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
Consolidated accounts are drawn up to 30 September each year and adjustments are made to the accounts of the subsidiaries where necessary to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of profit or loss on sale.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was written off against reserves and has not been reinstated.
Any such goodwill is not included in determining any profit or loss on disposal.
Property, plant and equipment Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords fixtures and fittings and other assets are held at cost.
The Groups licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued each year by professionally qualified external valuers and employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations.
Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken directly to the revaluation reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset which has previously been recognised as an expense in the Income Statement.
Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken directly to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset.
Any further decrease in value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlord fixtures and fittings are held at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The useful economic life of additions to landlord fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis to write off the total cost less residual value over their useful economic life.
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lower of the remaining lease term and their useful economic life of 50 years.
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line basis to residual value.
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment.
Where any indications are identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment.
Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement.

Accounting Policies continued Leases Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of future minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease payable.
Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are taken as an expense to the Income Statement.
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement over the lease term.
The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as operating leases are classified in the balance sheet as intangible assets: operating lease premiums within noncurrent assets and are amortised over the lease term.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying value and expected sale proceeds, net of selling costs.
Pubs and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified for disposal by the Group.
They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should be highly probable.
These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year.
Pubs held for sale are not depreciated and operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised.
Current assets held for sale Current assets held for sale comprises tenants fixtures and fittings and are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred on disposal.
Repairs and maintenance Repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Financial instruments i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand.
Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
ii Borrowings Borrowings which include bank borrowings, syndicated debt finance, debentures, secured bonds and securitised bonds are measured at amortised cost.
This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings across the life of the instrument.
iii Derivative financial instruments The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and these are classified as derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value on acquisition and are subsequently restated to fair value at each reporting date.
Any change in the fair value of the instruments is recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting has been adopted.
Hedge accounting is only adopted where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation documentation of the hedging relationship and it meets the Groups risk management strategy for undertaking the hedge, and it is expected to be highly effective.
The portion of any change in the fair value of the hedging instrument used in a cash flow hedge which meets the conditions for hedge accounting and is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity.
Changes in fair value relating to any ineffective portions are recognised in the Income Statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in equity are kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
In the case of interest rate swaps, the forecast transaction is the payment of interest.

Accounting Policies continued iv Equity instruments Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in Called up share capital and the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in Share Premium.
Net debt Net debt is the total of all financial assets and liabilities less cash.
Underlying net debt is amounts repayable to banks and other lenders, net of cash retained in the business.
Taxation The income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to off set current tax assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to be settled net or simultaneously.
Both current and deferred tax are recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the corresponding tax is also recognised in equity.
Tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amount of the provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Pension obligations The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees own pension plans is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
The defined benefit scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits.
The net amount recognised in the balance sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the schemes liabilities and the fair value of the schemes assets.
This is determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit.
The net of the expected return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance income or finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Treasury shares The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.

Accounting Policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and VAT.
Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Sales of beverages are recognised when these goods are delivered to our licensees.
Rents receivable are recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates.
Segmental reporting A business segment is a distinguishable component of an entity that provides a product or service that is subject to risks and returns that are different to those of other segments.
The Group has one business segment, being the operation of a leased and tenanted pub estate.
The Group operates solely within the UK and therefore also has just one geographical segment.
Share-based payments The Group has taken advantage of the exception in IFRS 1 in respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply IFRS 2 only to those awards granted after 7 November 2002 that were not vested at 1 January 2005.
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees.
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of award and this value is subsequently updated at each balance sheet date for managements best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period by calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income Statement.
A corresponding entry is made to equity.
The fair value of share options is measured using valuation models.
Dividends Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Operating profit Operating profit as referred to in the Income Statement is defined as being profit generated from normal trading activities before net profit on sale of property, plant and equipment, movements from revaluation of pub estate, interest, finance costs and taxation.
Exceptional items The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the Income Statement.
Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and include the following: a Exceptional administrative expenses The operating exceptional item shown within administrative expenses relates to legal, accountancy, professional and advisory fees in respect of the ongoing review of REIT restructuring.
b Net profit on sale of property, plant and equipment Net profit arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
c Movements from revaluation of pub estate Any revaluation that causes the book value of a pub to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge in the Income Statement.
If that same pub later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds historic cost, the increase in value is credited to the Income Statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognised.
Where pubs identified for disposal are written down to fair value less costs to sell, the associated write-down is also recognised in this line.
Most of the impact of the annual revaluation exercise is accounted for in equity and recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008 41 15809 04 12 2008 Proof 6  4 12 08 16:07 Page 42 Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2008 1.
Accounting Policies continued d Movement in fair value of financial instruments The interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value at each Balance Sheet date and the movement is recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting is adopted.
The movement in the fair value of swaps where hedge accounting is not applied is shown as an exceptional item.
Other movements include the unwind of the share buy back liability.
Tax A deferred tax liability has been recognised on the balance sheet relating to the pub estate.
On transition to IFRS, the Group elected to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions from 1 January 1999.
This led to an increase in goodwill in respect of this deferred tax.
As this pre-acquisition liability reduces due to capital gains indexation relief, a credit is recognised in the Income Statement.
This has been classified as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same period.
All other movements in respect of this deferred tax liability are accounted for in equity and recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The tax effect of all other exceptional items is also included within the exceptional items column in the Income Statement.
New standards and interpretations During the year the Group has adopted the capital disclosure requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
A number of new standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
The following standards which are relevant to the Company are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements, although the amendment to IAS 1 may result in some changes to the presentation of the financial statements.
The effective dates below represent the latest date that the Company will be required to implement the standard: Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs effective from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments effective from 1 January 2009.
IFRIC 14 The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction effective 1 October 2008.
Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements effective 1 October 2009.
Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements effective 1 October 2009.
Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations effective 1 July 2009.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations effective 1 September 2009.
Amendment to IAS 39 Eligible Hedged Items effective 1 July 2009.
Use of accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below: a Property, Plant and Equipment Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
The valuation is based on market observations and estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing.
Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value and their market value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub.
Further information about the valuation of the pub estate is provided in note 17 of these accounts.

Accounting Policies continued The Group estimates the useful economic life and residual value of property, plant and equipment PPE and these estimates influence the depreciation charged each year.
For details of these estimates, see the detailed accounting policy for PPE.
b Testing goodwill for impairment The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired.
Management makes judgements to allocate goodwill to the Group of cash generating units CGUs that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level at which goodwill is monitored.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the asset are shown in note 14. c Valuation of interest rate swaps The Group measures interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The swap valuation rates are derived from the mid point of the zero coupon prevailing at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract rate and the valuation rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry date.
The calculation therefore uses estimates of present values and future interest rates.
d Taxation Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained.
Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a liability will arise.
The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
e Other The Group also makes estimations and judgements in the valuation of share-based payments and the pension liability.
However, the value of these items is such that any variation in the estimates used is unlikely to have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Share buy-backs in close period In accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation a financial liability has been recognised when the Group enters into a contingent agreement with a third party which require the Group to purchase shares during the close period.
No contingent agreement had been entered into by the Group at 30 September 2008.
Presentation of interest rate swaps The 2007 balance sheet has been adjusted in respect of the presentation of interest rate swap fair values.
An amendment to IAS 1 requires financial liabilities not held for trading to be presented as current or non-current on the basis of settlement date.
Previously, all interest rate swaps that were not designated as part of an effective hedging relationship were presented as current liabilities.
This has resulted in a reduction in current liabilities of 18 million with a corresponding increase in non-current liabilities.
Revenue The Group operates in one segment, that of leased and tenanted pub operator in the UK.
Revenue is derived as follows: 2008 2007 m m Beer and cider sales 568 602 Wines, spirits and minerals sales 32 33 Rents receivable 258 261 Income from amusement and other machines 22 25 880 921 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008 43 15809 04 12 2008 Proof 6  4 12 08 16:07 Page 44 Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2008 3.

EBITDA impact of disposal of pubs The Group disposed of its Scottish estate of 137 pubs to Retail and Licensed Properties Limited on 5 December 2006.
The pubs disposed of generated a total of 2 million of EBITDA before exceptional items in the year ended 30 September 2007.
An analysis of the impact of these disposals on EBITDA in 2007 is set out below, to allow for a like-for-like comparison.

Taxation continued i The statutory corporation tax rate changed from 30% to 28% on 1 April 2008.
Therefore, the applicable tax rate in the note above is 29% for the year ended 30 September 2008, being six months of the year at 30% and six months of the year at 28%.
ii On transition to IFRS under IAS 12, a deferred tax liability was recognised on the balance sheet relating to the revaluation of the pub estate and gains previously rolled over, or due to be rolled over into other assets.
The deferred tax liability that would have been in place at the time of business combinations that have occured since 1 January 1999 resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill of 330 million as the fair value of the net assets acquired had been reduced.
This has been classed as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same period.
The exceptional indexation credit for the year ended 30 September 2008 is 33 million in total 1 million for property disposals and 32 million for retained properties compared with 28 million in 2007 4 million for property disposals and 24 million for retained properties.
Indexation is calculated with reference to the movement in the Retail Price Index during the year and the calculation is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Base cost of restated acquisitions 2,470 2,447 Retail Price Index movement in the year 4.8% 4.1% Capital gains indexation relief 119 100 Tax effect at 28% 33 28 c Deferred tax recognised in the Group Income Statement 2008 2007 PrePreexceptional Exceptional exceptional Exceptional items items Total items items Total m m m m m m Accelerated capital allowances i 8 8 9 9 Deferred tax on movement in fair value of interest rate swaps 6 6 Temporary differences 3 3 Deferred tax on share schemes 1 1 1 1 Deferred tax on profit on sale of property 7 7 Deferred tax on movement from revaluation of pub estate ii 14 14 1 1 Reduction in deferred tax liability due to indexation bii 33 33 28 28 Restatement of deferred tax balances for change in UK tax rate 23 23 7 47 40 11 39 28 i The 8 million deferred tax charge 2007 9 million relates to capital allowances claimed in the Groups tax computations in advance of depreciation.
See note 26 for further details.
ii The 14 million deferred tax credit on movements from the revaluation of the pub estate is the tax effect at 28% of the 53 million exceptional revaluation movement in the Income Statement as detailed in note 8.
In 2007 the revaluation movement was 2 million, giving rise to a 1 million tax credit.

This was a one-off adjustment and therefore no charge has arisen in 2008.

Earnings per Ordinary share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on earnings of 189 million 2007 291 million and on 497.4 million 2007 545.0 million shares being the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury.
Adjusted earnings per share, which the directors believe reflects the underlying performance of the Group, is based on earnings adjusted for the effects of exceptional items, net of tax, of 195 million 2007 216 million and on 497.4 million 2007 545.0 million shares being the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury.

Goodwill 2008 2007 m m At 1 October and 30 September 417 417 Impairment testing Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment.
For this purpose, the goodwill is allocated to the pub estate.
This represents the lowest level within the Group that goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The impairment test compares the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit with its carrying amount.
At the year ended 30 September 2008 the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
Value in use is calculated using budgeted EBITDA using forecasts of cash flow over a five year period.
The cash flows have been risk adjusted from prior year to include the impacts of the smoking ban together with the reduction in consumer spending as a result of the difficult economic conditions.
The key assumptions in these estimates have been reviewed by the Board of directors and are believed to be reasonable.
Cash flows beyond five years are extrapolated using a 3% growth rate 2007 3%.
The key driver to maintaining the growth rate is managements focus on an ongoing commitment to improve the quality of the estate through churn and capital expenditure whilst remaining focused on meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand.
The discount rate is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital WACC which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within the cash flow.
In making this adjustment to the Group WACC, management have risk adjusted by using the highest level of Market Risk premium and Company beta obtained from indepedent sources at the year end date to reflect the risk of the Group relative to the market as a whole.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the testing at 30 September 2008 was 8% 2007 8%.
As of 30 September 2008, the estimated value in use of the Groups pub estate exceeded carrying amount by 163 million and based on the risk adjusted cash flows as described above the pre-tax adjusted discount rate could increase to 8.2% before any impairment would be required.
Management have considered the volatility within the current economic climate within the risk adjusted cash flow and a reduction of 0.5% in the growth rate of cash flows would result in no impairment.
There is no impairment to goodwill in the period.

The land and buildings were valued at market value as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards Red Book, reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated by each property capitalised at an appropriate yield.
The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases or tenancies under which the properties are let.
Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location, pub quality and tenure.
The valuations are made with consideration given to market transactions within the UK pub sector.

Property, plant and equipment continued The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in Enterprise Inns plc have been valued by Humberts Leisure Limited.
The balance of the estate held in Enterprise Inns plc has been valued by the Head of Estates.
The results of this internal valuation have been compared to those of the external valuers.
This review ensured that the results are consistent.
A representative sample of the pubs held by Unique Pub Properties Limited Unique has been valued by Christie & Co.
The method of this valuation have been applied across the rest of the Unique estate on a pub by pub basis in line with the requirements of the securitisation.
The results of both the Unique and Enterprise valuations are also compared, ensuring consistency.
During the year Christie & Co. included a Red Book Guidance Note 5 disclosure in their valuation, which requires the valuer to draw attention to uncertainty in the market which may have a material effect on the valuation.
Christie & Co. state they have used valuer judgement to interpret the most recent available evidence and current market sentiments to arrive at their valuation, but caution that in the present economic circumstances the shelf life of any valuation report is reduced.
Pubs identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as non-current assets held for sale are held at fair value less costs to sell.
This value is based on the net estimated realisable disposal proceeds ERV which are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the properties.
If licensed land and buildings had been measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts would be as follows: Licensed land and buildings m At 30 September 2008 Cost 4,204 Accumulated depreciation 39 Net book value 4,165 At 30 September 2007 Cost 4,118 Accumulated depreciation 38 Net book value 4,080 The carrying value of property held under finance leases at 30 September 2008 was 257 million 2007 248 million.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Fair values The debenture, bonds and interest rate swaps were valued at fair value as at 30 September by J C Rathbone, independent valuers.
Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rates.
The finance lease payables are valued by calculating the present value of the future minimum lease payments.
Interest rate swaps are held at fair value and finance lease payables represents the present value of future minimum lease payments.
The liability for close period share buy-back contracts represents an estimate of the amount that may be incurred on share buy-backs during the period from 1 October to the date of the preliminary announcement of results.
There is no difference between the book value and the fair value of this provision.
Other categories of financial instruments include trade receivables and trade payables.
However, there is no difference between the book value and fair value of these items.
Cash balances include 65 million held within a securitised Reserve Account.
Withdrawals can only be made from this account with the consent of the securitised Trustee.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Interest rate swaps On 29 September 2006 the Group designated the 350 million swap that expires in September 2011 as an effective cash flow hedge under IAS 39.
This cash flow hedge is hedging future movements in interest rates until September 2011.
As a result, changes in the fair value of the effective portion of this swap are recognised directly in equity with changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised in the Income Statement.
All of the Groups swaps are in place to hedge cash payments made on the floating rate debt.
The movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps has been accounted for as follows: 2008 2007 m m At 1 October 13 39 Cash payment made 1 Fair value movements: ineffective portion and swaps not designated as effective hedges recognised in Income Statement 1 19 effective portion recognised in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve 5 6 At 30 September 19 13 Financial instruments and risk The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, a debenture, secured bonds, securitised bonds and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, specifically interest rate swaps and contracts to purchase shares in a close period.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Groups sources of finance and meet the objective of the Group share buy-back strategy.
In the year to 30 September 2008 the Group repaid and cancelled 35 million of a 100 million uncommitted, unsecured bank facility with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc and utilised 31 million of a 100 million committed, secured bank facility with HBOS plc.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
There is no currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised as follows.
Liquidity risk The Group has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, bank loans, debentures and securitised debt.
This objective is achieved through the following processes: Regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function Regular review of the Groups debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile Maintenance of undrawn overdraft and bank facilities Management of share buy-back programme At 30 September 2008, the nominal value of the Companys borrowings excluding interest rate swaps, liability for share buy-back contracts and finance lease payables comprised: 2008 2007 Syndicated and other bank borrowings 27% 27% Corporate bonds 31% 31% Securitised bonds 42% 42% 58 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008 15809 04 12 2008 Proof 6 158  4 12 08 16:07 Page 59 Notes to the Group Accounts at 30 September 2008 22.

The total amount of debt payable shown above differs from the total book value of Group debt of 3,861 million as the book value of Group debt includes the fair value of interest rate swaps which is based on discounted cash flows.
The contractural maturity of trade and other payables is within one year.
An analysis of minimum lease payments due under finance leases is set out in note 24.

Financial assets and liabilities continued The undrawn facilities relate to: 2008 2007 m m Undrawn liquidity facility 190 190 Undrawn element of committed bank facility 69 Undrawn element of uncommitted bank facility 65 The Liquidity Facility is in respect of the Unique securitisation and is a renewable committed facility of 190 million for a term of 364 days.
The Liquidity Facility is available to meet certain payment obligations falling due in the Unique securitisation to the extent that insufficient funds are received to meet such payments.
The Liquidity Facility is due for renewal on 30 September 2009.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows its debenture and bonds except for the A2N bonds at a fixed rate.
Bank debt and the A2N bonds are borrowed at, and cash balances attract interest at, a floating rate.
The Groups objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
This exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates and using interest rate swaps acquired by Group companies.
At 30 September 2008, the Groups borrowings were 89% fixed after including the impact of interest rate swaps with an average interest rate of 6.5% for 10 years 2007 89% fixed at an average rate of 6.5% for 11 years.
Cash flows associated with cash deposits, debt and interest rate swaps and the fair value of these instruments fluctuates with changes in interest rates.
The effect on the profit for the year would have been as follows if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower during the period.
Movement in Interest Interest fair value of receivable payable interest rate swap m m m As reported in Income Statement 7 248 1 Effect if interest rates increased by 50 basis points 0.5% 8 250 7 Difference 1 2 8 As reported in Income Statement 7 248 1 Effect if interest rates decreased by 50 basis points 0.5% 6 245 10 Difference 1 3 9 Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances.
The Groups objective is to minimise this risk by dealing with third parties with high credit ratings and carrying out credit checks where appropriate.
The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet is net of a bad debt provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
At 30 September 2008 the value of collateral is 31 million 2007 30 million.
This balance is held on the balance sheet in other payables.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.
This provision relates to trade receivables which are primarily owed by licensees.

Financial assets and liabilities continued There are no trade receivables that are past due at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against.
There are no indications as at 30 September 2008 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are neither past due nor impaired.
The maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables and the fair value of interest rate swaps classified as financial assets.
The Groups credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the Group only invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.
Security Senior debt finance is secured by a security deed entered into by substantially all of the companies which comprise the Group, excluding Enterprise Inns Holding Company Limited and its subsidiaries and Unique Pubs Limited and its subsidiaries.
The lenders have a floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of such Group companies.
The floating charge ranks subsequent to the fixed charges created by the debenture and secured bonds.
The value of assets secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2008 is: Property, Plant and Equipment 5,832 million 2007 5,683 million, operating lease premiums 18 million 2007 19 million and pubs held for sale 11 million 2007 11 million.
Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt The Group defines capital as total equity.
The capital structure is managed to support the Groups objective of maximising long-term shareholder value through ready access to debt and capital markets, cost-effective borrowing and flexibility to fund buisness and acquisition opportunities whilst maintaining appropriate leverage to optimise the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group is based upon managements judgement of the appropriate balancing of all key elements of its financial strategy in order to meet the Groups operational and strategic requirements.
The overall financing strategy of the Group is presented to the Board annually for approval.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of a net debt ratio, being net debt divided by net debt plus equity.
Net debt is defined as the book value of the Groups debt less cash note 22.
Equity is defined as total shareholders funds.
Leases The Group as lessee The Group leases a proportion of its licensed estate from landlords under finance leases and operating leases.
These leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.

Leases continued The Group as lessor The Group leases its licensed estate and other non-licensed properties to tenants.
The majority of lease agreements have terms of between six months and 30 years and are classified for accounting purposes as operating leases.
Most of the leases with terms of over three years include provision for rent reviews on either a 3 or five year basis.
The present value of future minimum lease rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Future minimum lease rentals receivable under operating leases: within one year 223 249 after one year but not more than five years 768 884 in more than five years 1,585 1,865 2,576 2,998 Leases with future minimum lease rentals receivable under operating leases in more than five years have an average term of 14.5 years remaining on their agreements.

STIP and LTIP Executive directors are eligible to participate in an STIP and LTIP plan.
A summary of the rules of these schemes along with details of shares that have been granted and are outstanding in relation to individual directors is included in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 24 to 33.
Other members of the executive management team are also eligble to participate in an STIP scheme.
Share awards vest based on achievement of personal objectives and of Group EBITDA targets.
Shares awarded vest equally on the first and second anniversary of fulfilment of performance targets.

All of the shares outstanding at 30 September 2008 are not yet exercisable.
The share price at which the number of shares granted under the STIP scheme is calculated is not confirmed until after the date of the approval of the accounts.
The maximum number of STIP shares granted during the year is therefore estimated using the closing share price on 30 September 2008.
The number of shares granted in 2007 has been amended to show the actual number granted in 2007.

Share-based payments continued The weighted average fair value of shares granted during the year under the STIP was 5.30 2007 5.25 restated for actual number of shares granted in 2007 and under the LTIP was 2.86 2007 5.08.
The weighted average share price on exercise of shares and share options under all schemes during the year was 4.53 2007 6.53.
Fair value of share schemes The fair value of equity-settled share options and share awards granted is estimated at the date of grant using share option valuation models.
The ESOS, SAYE and STIP schemes are valued using the BlackScholes model.
The element of the LTIP scheme that relates to non-market conditions is valued using the BlackScholes model.
The element of the LTIP that includes market conditions is valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model.
The following tables list the inputs to the models for options and shares granted during the year: ESOS SAYE Weighted average: 2008 2007 2008 2007 Share price 5.07 6.18 4.84 5.84 Exercise price 5.07 6.18 4.25 4.67 Dividend yield 2.4% 2.9% 2.4% 2.9% Expected volatility 23% 20% 24% 21% Risk-free interest rate 4.46% 4.76% 4.29% 5.17% Expected life of option years 3.3 3.3 5 or 7 5 or 7 STIP LTIP Weighted average: 2008 2007 2008 2007 Share price 5.76 5.76 4.90 6.77 Exercise price Dividend yield 2.4% 2.9% 2.4% 2.9% Expected volatility 22% 20% 23% 20% Risk-free interest rate 4.69% 4.82% 4.4% 4.9% Expected life of option years 24 years 24 years 35 35 Expected share-price volatility is based on historic volatility over the same period of time as the vesting period of the option.
The expected life of an option is based on historical data.
The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met.
This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria have therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP.
These conditions have been incorporated into the Monte Carlo Simulation model which is used to fair value the TSR element of the scheme.
The 2007 weighted averages have been amended to reflect the actual number of shares granted in 2007.
Two STIP schemes are in place.
One vests equally after two and three years and the other vests after four years.
The LTIP vests in three equal tranches after three, four and five years.
