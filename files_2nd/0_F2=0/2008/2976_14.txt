38 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2008 Notes to the accounts 1 Principal accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Group are made up to the Saturday nearest to 30 April.
The financial year for 2008 represents the 53 weeks ended 3 May 2008.
The comparative financial year for 2007 was 52 weeks ended 28 April 2007.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union, together with those parts of the Companies Acts 1985 and 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, pension assets and liabilities and share-based payments which are measured at fair value.
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise stated.
Where applicable comparative amounts have been restated to conform with current presentation.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal respectively.
Change of accounting policy In view of the significant capital project relating to the new cutting and distribution centre and in anticipation of the changes being made to International Accounting Standard 23 the Group has changed its accounting policy and now capitalises interest on qualifying tangible fixed assets.
Interest of 0.9 million has been capitalised during the period of which 0.1 million related to the prior year.
As the adjustment for the prior year is immaterial the comparatives have not been restated.
Exchange differences The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies, which are those other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at the opening rate for the month in which the transaction occurs which is used as a reasonable approximation to the rate at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Resulting exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement for the period except where they are part of a net foreign investment hedge when they are recognised in equity.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at the average rate during the period.
Differences on translation are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative exchange differences for that operation are recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of that operation and are translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Segment reporting A geographical segment has operations within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
The Group recognises only geographical segments as the business operation is the same throughout the Group.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods and services to customers outside the Group net of returns, sales allowances and value added and other sales based taxes.
Revenue from goods and services is recognised at the point the Group fulfils its commercial obligations to the customer, the revenue and costs in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenue arising from the provision of services is not material.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense and is calculated using Black-Scholes and Monte-Carlo models.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimates of the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the vesting period.
Impairment The carrying values of assets are reviewed for indications of impairment at each balance sheet date.
If there is an indication of impairment the recoverable amount of either the asset or the cash-generating unit to which it belongs is estimated.
Cash-generating units are used where an individual asset does not generate cash flows which are independent of other assets.
The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2008 39 1 Principal accounting policies continued Other operating income Other operating income comprises profits or losses on the disposal of property, rental income earned on investment property and income from other property transactions, other than amounts which are, or should be, accounted for as rent.
Profits or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment represent the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying value at the date of disposal.
Disposals are accounted for when there has been an unconditional exchange of contracts except where payment or completion is expected to occur significantly after exchange when the disposal is accounted for on completion.
Non-recurring items Transactions which are material by virtue of their size or incidence such as major reorganisation costs are disclosed as non-recurring items.
Tax Current tax liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of tax that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and is not discounted.
Tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity, otherwise it is recognised in the income statement.
Dividends Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, paid.
Goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of cash-generating units at the level management monitor goodwill.
Where businesses are retained in existing form this is at business unit level.
Where the business is integrated into an existing business this is at store level.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired entity.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets Purchased brand names and other intangible assets are capitalised at cost.
Acquired software licences and software development costs are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Amortisation of intangible assets is calculated to write off the cost of the asset, on a straight-line basis, over its expected useful life.
The expected useful lives generally applicable are: Brands 20 years Computer software 7 years Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided to write down the cost of property, plant and equipment, on a straight-line basis, to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives by asset category that are generally applicable are: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold buildings The shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful life Fixtures and fittings 7 to 10 years Computers 5 to 7 years Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 7 to 10 years Borrowing costs Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects are capitalised until the time that they are available for use.
Unless a specific borrowing is taken out to finance the asset interest is capitalised using the weighted average interest rate of all non-specific borrowings.
Where a specific borrowing is taken out to finance the asset interest is capitalised at the rate applicable to that borrowing.
40 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2008 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Investment property Property that is held to earn rental income and for capital appreciation is separately disclosed as investment property.
Investment property is carried at depreciated historical cost.
Depreciation rates and useful lives of investment property are the same as those for property, plant and equipment.
Leasing commitments Leases are classified as finance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets used by the Group which have been funded through finance leases are capitalised in fixed assets and the resulting lease obligations are included in creditors.
The assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives and the period of the lease.
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Premiums payable, rent free periods and contributions receivable on entering an operating lease are released to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Investment in subsidiaries The Companys investment in subsidiary undertakings is recognised at cost and is accounted for net of impairment losses.
Income from investments is recognised in the income statement to the extent that post acquisition profits are received.
Distributions of pre-acquisition profits reduce the cost of the investment.
Investments in joint ventures Joint ventures are established through an interest in a jointly controlled entity.
Investments in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given, and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling prices less further costs to be incurred to disposal.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark down and shrinkage based on actual losses, ageing of inventories and sales trends.
Rebates receivable from suppliers Volume related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the inventory to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier covers more than one year, the rebates are recognised in the period in which they are earned.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently adjusted to the amount receivable or payable.
Receivables are stated net of a provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, cash at bank, deposits repayable on demand and highly liquid investments.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement cash and cash equivalents also includes bank overdrafts.
Bank loans and overdrafts Bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate model.
Provisions A provision is recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes and also participates in a multi-employer pension scheme in respect of its employees in The Netherlands.
The assets and liabilities of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities of the multi-employer scheme and, therefore, accounts for this scheme as a defined contribution scheme.
The pension cost of all defined contribution schemes is charged in the income statement as incurred.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The net retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full, directly in equity in the period in which they occur and are presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Other income and expenses associated with the defined benefit scheme are recognised in the income statement.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2008 41 1 Principal accounting policies continued Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments derivatives are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
In accordance with its Treasury policy, the Group does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are stated at their fair value.
The fair value of interest rate contracts is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate them at the balance sheet date, taking into account prevailing interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the asset or liability for the hedged transaction is recognised in the balance sheet, the associated gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is included in the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability.
Gains or losses realised on cash flow hedges are then recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item.
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings the gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are recognised in equity.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is retained in equity until the hedged transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is then transferred to the income statement.
Critical estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: Impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash-generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Actual outcomes could vary significantly from these estimates.
Impairment of assets Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is determined based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates.
Retirement benefits The present value of the defined benefit liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is dependent on the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds.
The net financing charge is dependent on both the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds and the assumed investment returns on scheme assets.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations, including mortality rates, are based in part on current market conditions.
Deferred tax Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised.
The assessment of probability that such profits will be available is based on managements assumptions and estimates in projecting future profitability.

50 Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2008 Notes to the accounts continued 10 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding those held by Equity Trust Guernsey Limited see Note 5 which are treated as cancelled.
In order to compute diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive Ordinary shares.
Those share options granted to employees and Executive Directors where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the period, represent potentially dilutive Ordinary shares.
