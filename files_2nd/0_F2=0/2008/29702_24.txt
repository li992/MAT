Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, and to the extent that they have been adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2005 is consistent with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis compliant with the SORP.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Financial statements of all Group companies are prepared for the same reporting period.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and are presented separately in the income statement and within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
However, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Presentation of income statement In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the income statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the income statement.
In accordance with the Companys status as a UK investment company under Section 266 of the Companies Act 1985, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Companys contractual right to the cash flow from the asset expires or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, with gains and losses recognised in the income account.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value.
As the Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income or capital gains, such financial assets are designated as fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
Incidental costs on acquisition of such assets are expensed.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which for investment funds is at their net asset value based on the fair value of the underlying investments.
Quoted instruments are valued at either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
In respect of unquoted instruments, or where the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is established by using recognised valuation methodologies, in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEVC Valuation Guidelines.
New investments are initially carried at cost, for a limited period, being the price of the most recent investment in the investee.
This is maintained to the extent that it represents fair value and is in accordance with IPEVC Guidelines as the cost of recent investments will generally provide a good indication of fair value until such time as it is appropriate to measure fair value on a different basis.
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
Gains and losses arising from investments, designated as investments held at fair value through profit or loss, are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on fair value through profit or loss investments are included within the changes in its fair value.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations and foreign exchange movements.
It is not the Groups policy to trade in derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Fair value is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Cash flow hedges For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred SVG Capital plc 52 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Corporate information Financial information Company information 1 Accounting policies continued to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss.
A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if all of the following conditions are met.
at the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entitys risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the h edged risk, consistently with the originally documented risk management strategy for that particular hedging relationship.
for cash flow hedges, a forecast transaction that is the subject of the hedge must be highly probable and must present an expo sure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss.
the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured, i. e. the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attribu table to the hedged risk and the fair value of the hedging instrument can be reliably measured.
the hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and determined actually to have been highly effective throughout the financial repor ting periods for which the hedge was designated.
Current financial assets Financial assets purchased with a view to subsequent resale to an associated entity warehoused investments are carried at fair value, being the proposed transfer price of the asset, and included in current assets.
Investments in subsidiaries In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investment in subsidiaries at cost, unless they are investment vehicles, in which case they are included at fair value.
Investments in associates In accordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates, the standard does not apply to investments held in associates by private equity organisations that are designated as fair value through profit and loss.
Such investments are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they occur.
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Bank borrowings and loan notes Interest-bearing bank loans and loan notes issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Convertible loan notes Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
Issue costs are allocated proportionately to the liability and equity components.
The carrying amount to maturity of the liability component is measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The cost of equity-settled share-based payments with employees of the Group are measured at fair value at the date of grant and recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
No expense is recognised in the Companys income statement as there are no equity instruments issued in consideration for the provision of employee services to the Company.
The cost of equity awards to employees of subsidiaries is added to the Companys investment in subsidiaries.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Interest income is classified within operating activities in the cash flow statement.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment has been established and is classified within operating activities in the cash flow statement.
SVG Capital plc 53 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Investment management and advisory fees are accrued over the period for which the service is provided.
Performance fees are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant contractual agreement.
The Companys revenue and capital gains are derived primarily from distributions in respect of its holdings in fund investments.
The Company accounts for such distributions by reference to the underlying source of the distribution.
Realised profits on capital distributions which arise from the realisation of investments within the funds will be credited to the income statement and taken to the Companys capital reserve.
Income distributions will be credited to the income statement and taken to the Companys revenue reserve.
Management and advisory fee income are accrued over the period for which the service is provided.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as lessee Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
All borrowing costs are charged directly to revenue and are classified within operating activities in the cash flow statement.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The costs relating to defined benefit schemes are accounted for in the same way as for defined contribution schemes where the Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying performance and financial position of the plan with sufficient reliability for accounting purposes.
Such situations arise where the contributions payable by the Group are set in terms of the scheme as a whole and, as such, there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the Groups obligations, plan assets, or costs.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is pounds sterling.
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement and are allocated either to revenue or capital, as appropriate.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups capital reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Investment trusts which have approval under Section 842 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Property, plant and equipment Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost, including direct acquisition costs, less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Telecommunications and office equipment 10% 20% Leasehold improvements 10% Computer equipment 20% 33% The Group does not ordinarily provide for depreciation against art.
SVG Capital plc 54 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Corporate information Financial information Company information 1 Accounting policies continued The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short term cash commitments rather than for investment purposes.
Assets are classified as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to cash and are not subject to significant changes in value.
The Company has classified short term bank deposits, investments in money market funds and short-dated treasury bills as cash equivalents.

SVGA and the Schemes trustees, taking advice from the independent actuaries, agree the contributions.
In accordance with IAS 19, the Groups contributions to the Scheme are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme on the basis that the Group is unable to readily identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Scheme at the balance sheet date as there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the obligations, plan assets and costs to the Group.
Further details of the Scheme can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts of Schroders plc.
In particular, the Scheme had 299 active members in the defined benefit section at 31 December 2008 and the accounts of Schroders plc disclosed a net pension asset in respect of the Scheme of 22.4 million, calculated under IAS 19 based on valuations as at 1 January 2006 prepared by independent qualified actuaries.

During the year ended 31 December 2008, losses on investments amounted to 814.0 million 2007: gain of 113.4 million for the Group and 813.8 million 2007: gain of 112.2 million for the Company.
As detailed in notes 32 and 33, the Company has agreed that it should focus its investments mainly on Permira Funds.
As such, and given that our largest exposures currently are to Permira Funds see notes 19 and 34, we expect that the performance of the Company will be largely dependent on the performance of the Permira Funds in which we invest.

Excess management expenses relating to the venture fund investments are available to set against any taxable income of the Company.
These excess management expenses are included within the investments in venture funds in the balance sheet of the Company and are not reflected in the Companys revenue account.
If in a future year in relation to the venture fund investments income exceeds expenses, the taxation charge to the Companys revenue account will include tax on this excess with a suitable note by way of explanation.
A legislative change in the UK has reduced the main corporation tax rate from 30% to 28%, with effect from 1 April 2008.
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 28% 2007: 28%.
A deferred tax asset of 683,000 2007: 355,000 has been recognised by SVG Advisers Inc. in respect of US taxation.
A deferred tax asset of 1,900,000 2007: 2,864,000 has been recognised in respect of SVG Advisers Ltd. A deferred tax asset of 9.6 million 2007: 16.2 million, of which nil 2007: 3.4 million would have been recognised in equity, relating to losses and other temporary differences, has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which these losses and temporary differences can be utilised.
The excess management expenses and other temporary differences to which this unrecognised asset relates are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits.

The Group diluted net asset values per share assume that share options and performance shares note 20 with a strike price lower than the undiluted net asset value per share are exercised at the balance sheet date.
This would result in the issue of 2,084,824 ordinary shares 31 December 2007: 9,227,167 for consideration of 720,000 31 December 2007: 38,732,000.
The Company diluted net asset values per share assume that share options and performance shares note 20 with a strike price lower than the undiluted net asset value per share are exercised at the balance sheet date.
The convertible bonds 2016 are exercisable at a strike price of 1000p and are therefore not dilutive at 31 December 2008.
Therefore, the calculation of the diluted net asset value per share of the Group is based on Group net assets attributable to equity shareholders of 434,893,000 31 December 2007: 1,338,333,000, and on 141,154,725 31 December 2007: 148,291,601 ordinary shares in issue at the year end.

Related party transactions during the year were made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arms length transactions.
SVG Capital plc 76 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Corporate information Financial information Company information 33 Risk Financial instruments and risk profile The Companys primary investment objective is to achieve capital appreciation by investing principally in private equity funds which are managed or advised by Permira, a leading international private equity specialist.
These investments are typically illiquid.
In addition, the Company holds money market instruments, cash and short term deposits and various items such as debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
These financial instruments held by the Company are generally liquid.
The holding of securities, investing activities and associated financing undertaken pursuant to this objective involves certain inherent risks.
Events may occur that would result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of revenue profits available for dividend.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long term.
The Company has not taken out any derivatives contracts to date, other than the interest rate swap agreements referred to in note 18, which are used to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates with respect to the floating rate Senior Notes in issue.
Further details regarding the risks faced by the Company are explained in the Business Review on pages 8 to 23.
Non-interest bearing assets represent non-monetary items such as the Groups investment portfolio, warehoused assets and other short term debtors.
Floating rate financial assets consist of cash at bank, short term deposits and AAA-rated money market funds.
Fixed rate financial assets comprise euro-denominated Treasury Bills, which have a known yield to redemption if held to maturity.
All financial assets are included at fair value.
SVG Capital plc 77 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 33 Risk continued b Financial liabilities The Company issued a further 40 million of Senior Notes in January 2008 and has 332 million of Senior Notes outstanding at the year end.
The Company issued 120 million of subordinated convertible bonds in June 2008.
The Company does not have any other borrowings at the balance sheet date, although it does have in place a loan facility of 550 million with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, The Bank of Scotland plc and Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG.
At 31 December 2008 the loan facility was undrawn.
In addition to financial liabilities, the Company also has uncalled fund commitments of 492.8 million note 19 as at 31 December 2008, which are discussed below as part of commitment risk.
The level of borrowing will impact on the Groups performance by amplifying the effect of movements in the valuation of the investment portfolio.
It should also be noted that fund investments and underlying investee companies may also utilise borrowings to varying degrees.
This is particularly the case with respect to CLO funds and structured private equity funds of funds, which are highly leveraged vehicles.
Currency denomination of financial liabilities of the Company and the Group: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 000 000 Sterling 159,021 16,879 Euro 38,280 29,172 US dollar 237,533 172,086 434,834 218,137 Gross contractual cash-flows cumulative interest and principal amounts payable on the long-term liabilities of the Company and Group are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 000 000 Senior Notes due 18 July 2013 186,886 147,501 Senior Notes due 18 July 2014 188,753 145,184 Senior Notes due 18 July 2015 71,678 15,325 Convertible Bonds due 5 June 2016 194,250 641,567 308,010 Based on exchange rates at each year-end and allowing for interest rate swaps.
Risks The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are considered to be commitment risk and valuation risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policy for managing these and other risks as summarised below.
The Directors consider that the risks faced by the Group are primarily those faced by the Company.
Commitment liquidity risk The nature of investing in buy-out and development capital funds entails making significant financial commitments, as shown in note 19.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had significant uncalled commitments of 492.8 million 2007: 1,635.5 million, compared to Shareholders funds of 434.2 million 2007: 1,299.6 million.
It is anticipated that over the longer term, and in normal circumstances, commitments would be financed by available cash resource distributions received on the realisation of existing investments, although in the current market environment it is not anticipated that there will be significant realisations from the investment portfolio in the short term.
In addition, the Group had a 550 million loan facility at the year end that could be drawn on, subject to financial covenants, to meet commitments as they fall due.
However, a residual risk remains that the Group could be unable to meet its future commitments in full.
If as a consequence of a failure to pay a call, the Company is treated as a defaulting investor to the relevant Fund, it will suffer a resultant dilution in interest and possibly the compulsory sale of its interest.
In December 2008 the Company agreed to reduce its commitment to Permira IV.
The total direct commitment by the Company to Permira IV was 2.4 billion, of which 51.6% had been called.
The Company elected to cap its commitment at 60% of the total, resulting in an uncalled commitment of 202 million which will only be called to finance follow-on investments and fees.
The terms of these arrangements require that future distributions from the realisation of portfolio companies receivable by those investors in Permira IV that elected to cap their commitments will be reduced by 25%, such benefit to accrue to the Limited Partners that did not elect to cap their uncalled commitments.
The Companys loan facility expires in March 2011.
The Senior Notes in issue mature between July 2013 to July 2015 see note 18.
The Convertible Bonds are repayable in 2016.
The Board manages liquidity risk by regularly and rigorously reviewing cash flow forecasts and available funding options.
Commitments to fund investments are reviewed by the Investment Committee and approved by the Board.
SVG Capital plc 78 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Corporate information Financial information Company information 33 Risk continued Valuation market price risk The Companys exposure to valuation risk comprises mainly movements in the value of its underlying investments.
A breakdown of the Fund portfolio is given on pages 24 and 25 and a detailed analysis of the 20 largest underlying companies is given on pages 16 to 19.
In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, set out on pages 52 to 55, all underlying investments are valued at fair value by the Directors in accordance with the current International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEVC Valuation Guidelines.
The IPEVC Guidelines contain detailed methodology setting out best practice with respect to valuing unquoted investments.
It should be noted that a large proportion of the Companys underlying investee companies are expected to be unquoted and therefore the valuation of such companies involves exercising judgement.
The Company does not hedge against movements in the value of these investments.
Uncertainty arises as a result of future changes in the valuation of the Companys underlying investments, the majority of which are unquoted, and the effect changes in exchange rates may have in the sterling value of these investments.
Development-stage equity investments and early-stage equity investments, by their nature, involve uncertainty as to the ultimate value likely to be realised on the disposal of those investments, particularly as their unquoted nature means that a ready market may not exist for them.
As an indication of the valuation risk facing the Company, in 2008 the Group suffered losses on its investment portfolio totalling 818.6 million 2007: gain of 113.4 million.
The Companys sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in the Companys levels of borrowing see note 18 and liquidity, as approved by the Board.
It will also be affected by leverage in the funds in which we invest and the local currency denomination of such funds, which is considered separately under currency risk.
At 31 December 2008, a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups aggregate investments designated as fair value through profit and loss, would result in a 17.3% change in Shareholders funds.
Valuation risk will be affected by leverage in the underlying investee companies.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the valuations of the 20 largest underlying investee companies, which had an aggregate valuation before providing for carried interest of 568.9 million or 91.3% of the gross private equity portfolio valuation 2007: 1,157.0 million or 85.0%, the results of which are set out in the table below.
Hypothetical Hypothetical fair value fair value 10% writeFair value 10% uplift down million million million 31 December 2008 Gross valuation of 20 largest investee companies 568.9 754.0 388.8 Change in valuation effect on income 32.6% 31.6% 31 December 2007 Gross valuation of 20 largest investee companies 1,157.0 1,370.2 936.8 Change in valuation effect on income 18.4% 19.0% All investments are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
Quoted companies are valued based on market prices and recently acquired unquoted investments may be carried at cost.
For such investments, a 10% movement in the valuation basis will have a 10% impact on fair value.
For unquoted investments valued on a different basis, such as earnings-related, a 10% movement in the earnings of the investee company will not necessarily result in a 10% change in fair value, because of other factors such as the level of debt utilised by the investee companies.
The Board manages valuation risk by reviewing and approving the valuation of the private equity fund portfolio.
SVG Capital plc 79 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 33 Risk continued Holdings risk In certain circumstances, the Company may wish to transfer its holdings in particular funds.
In a majority of the funds in which the Company will invest, the general partner, trustee or manager has the ultimate right, similar to that exercisable by a board of a private company, to refuse to register the transfer of an interest.
While the Company has no reason to believe that any request for the transfer of an interest would be refused, it is of course conceivable that the general partners, trustees or managers overriding fiduciary duty could result in its refusing to register a particular transfer proposed by the Company.
Concentration risk The Directors believe that the diversified nature of the underlying investments in the Companys private equity fund portfolio reduces the risks normally associated with making investments in the buy-out and development capital markets.
However, it should be noted that, in accordance with its stated investment objective, the Company intends to focus its investments principally in private equity funds that are managed or advised by Permira.
As outlined in note 8, the future performance of the Company will therefore be largely dependent on the future performance of the Permira Funds in which we invest see notes 19 and 34 for an indication of the Companys exposures.
The Directors believe that this represents an opportunity, but investors should also be aware that greater concentration of the investment portfolio also presents a risk.
Interest rate risk The Companys revenue will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates since a large portion of its income ordinarily derives from money market instruments and bank deposit interest.
It also pays interest on its Senior Notes and drawings on the loan facility that may be taken out from time to time.
The Companys primary objective is to achieve capital returns from its investments and, as such, the main exposure to interest rate risk is indirect, through its impact on the valuation of the private equity funds, although it is not possible to quantify such effects.
Interest rates are one of the key determinants of economic growth.
At a more specific level, interest rates and credit spreads also have an important role in the ability of private equity funds to secure profitable deals, as many transactions are partly financed by debt.
The effect of interest rate changes on the valuation of investments and debt forms part of valuation risk, which is considered separately.
At 31 December 2008, the Company held investments in AAA-rated money market funds valued at 111.4 million 2007: 56.8 million, earning interest at market rates.
The money market funds are redeemable on less than 24 hours notice.
Other floating rate financial assets comprised cash at bank or short term deposits.
At 31 December 2008, the Company had 332.2 million of Senior Notes in issue and 102.6 million of Bonds see note 18.
Interest rate risk on the Senior Notes and the Bonds is mitigated as the Bonds and most of the Notes pay fixed rates of interest and swap agreements have been taken out with respect to the floating rate notes.
Taking account of changes to interest costs following the debt renegotiations in December 2008, the weighted average interest rate payable on the Notes and the swaps amounted to 8.70% at 31 December 2008.
The timing of the cash flows in respect of the interest rate swaps exactly matches those of the floating rate notes that are being hedged.
All interest payments on the Senior Notes are effectively fixed and the Company considers that the swaps are effective in providing a hedge against interest rate risk.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps included in the balance sheet amount to a liability of 846,000 at 31 December 2008 2007: asset of 33,000 and have been valued by The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, the swap counterparty.
Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Company unless otherwise disclosed.
The Company is subject to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to cash and cash equivalents is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Company's cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties with a credit rating of AA or better.
Cash equivalents at the year end comprised money market funds with a variety of counterparties, each fund having a credit rating of AAA.
SVG Capital plc 80 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Corporate information Financial information Company information 33 Risk continued Currency risk The Company is exposed to currency risk directly since the majority of its assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency and their sterling value can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Company does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
However, the Company has issued Senior Notes of US$345 million and 40 million, respectively, which act as a partial hedge against assets denominated in those currencies and could be swapped into other currencies if deemed appropriate.
The Company also has a 550 million loan facility which, if drawn, would act as a hedge against the currency risk on the value of its euro-denominated assets.
The Company and Group has also entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate against movements in exchange rates.
These contracts are primarily to provide a cash-flow hedge against euro-denominated investment management and advisory fees receivable by subsidiary companies in 2009 and 2010.
The total outstanding under such contracts at 31 December 2008 amounted to a sale of 44.0 million in exchange for 35.3 million.
A fair value loss of 5.7 million was taken to equity in respect of these contracts as a result of the appreciation of euro against sterling.
In addition, SVG Capital had an outstanding forward foreign exchange contract at 31 December to sell 64.3 million in exchange for $80.0 million, with an unrealised loss at 31 December 2008 of 6.6 million taken through the income statement as a result of the appreciation of euro against the dollar.
The contract settled in January 2009.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the valuations on the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of shareholders funds, the results of which are set out in the table below.
