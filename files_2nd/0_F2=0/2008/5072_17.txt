These are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
The carrying value of goodwill is as follows: 31 May 31 May 2008 2007 000 000 Restated note 30 Installation Services 55,594 36,767 Specialist Support Services 1,435 1,366 57,029 38,133 The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board and extrapolates cash flows based on an estimated growth rate of 2%.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 12.2% which is estimated from the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 8.8% post tax.
As at 31 May 2008 the Directors are satisfied that the values in use exceed their carrying value.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the following types of financial risk on the financial performance of the Group by monitoring levels of borrowings and the related finance costs.
In order to ensure stability of cash out flows, and hence manage interest rate risk, the Group has a policy of using a mixture of floating and fixed rate debt.
Further to this the Group seeks to minimise the risk of uncertain funding in its operations by borrowing within a spread of maturity periods.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate costs and as such no hedge accounting is applied.
Capital Risk Management The Groups primary objectives in managing its capital are to safeguard the business as a going concern: to maintain sufficient financial flexibility to undertake its investment plans: and to optimise capital structure in order to reduce the cost of capital.
The Groups financial profile and level of financial risk is assessed on a regular basis in the light of changes to the economic conditions, business environment, changes to the Groups business profile and the risk characteristics of its businesses.
In order to maintain or adjust capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
Credit Risk The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
The Group has Board approved maximum counterparty exposure limits for specified banks and financial institutions limited to financial institutions with an AA rating or higher.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk as follows: 31 May 31 May 2008 2007 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 15,322 6,776 Trade and other receivables 78,027 53,126 Derivative financial instruments 559 548 Current asset investments 4,938 4,632 Liquidity Risk The Group actively manages its exposure to liquidity risk and ensures maximum flexibility in meeting changing business needs.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities to provide liquidity back-up for the foreseeable future.
The undrawn committed facilities and maturity profiles available to the Group at the balance sheet date are as follows: 31 May 31 May 2008 2007 000 000 Within one year 1,400 320 In two to five years 35,000 35,000 36,400 35,320 The Group monitors compliance against all its financial obligations and it is Group policy to manage the consolidated balance sheet so as to operate well within these covenanted restrictions at all times.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Foreign Currency Risk The Group operates in Canada, India and the Republic of Ireland and is exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from commercial transactions, and from recognised assets, liabilities and investments in foreign operations.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the year end are as follows: 31 May 31 May 2008 2007 Monetary assets Canadian dollar C$000 3,609 3,911 Euro 000 1,370 Indian rupee INR000 17,952 17,312 Monetary liabilities Canadian dollar C$000 2,613 3,224 Euro 000 505 Indian rupee INR000 3,309 7,163 Foreign currency risk is not considered to represent a significant risk at this time as the level of foreign currency transactions is immaterial in the context of the Group and accordingly a sensitivity analysis is not presented.
Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
Interest bearing assets include only cash balances and current asset investments, which earn interest at a floating rate of interest linked to UK Bank Base Rate.
The Group maintains its debt at a floating rate of interest due to the low gearing of the Group other than the hire purchase obligations and redeemable preference shares that are held at a fixed rate of interest.
The following table summarises the Groups borrowings between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
31 May 31 May 2008 2007 000 000 Floating rate borrowings: Bank overdrafts 1,244 Property loan 264 248 264 1,492 Fixed rate borrowings: Hire purchase obligations 90 330 Cumulative redeemable preference share 118 109 208 439 Total borrowings 472 1,931 Interest rate risk is not considered significant at this time as the Group is net cash positive and accordingly a sensitivity analysis is not presented.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds managed by third parties.
The pension cost charged to the income statement represents contributions payable by the Group to the funds and amounted to 3,297,000 31 May 2007: 2,539,000. x71226 Rhouse back p2 cg:x71226 Rhouse back p2 cg 5 9 08 15:28 Page 36 69 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 eaga 33.
