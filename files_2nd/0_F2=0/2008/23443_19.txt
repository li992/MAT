16 Financial Instruments i Management of Risk As an investment trust, the Groups investment objective is to seek capital growth from a portfolio of securities drawn from markets both within the UK and worldwide.
The holding of these financial instruments to meet this objective results in certain risks.
The Groups financial instruments comprise: 1.
Securities in unquoted and quoted companies, partnership interests and floating rate notes.
A loan facility, the purpose of which is to finance tender offers, other share buy-backs and on-market purchases of shares, the financing of new investment and refinancing existing debt.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate, liquidity, capital and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review and the preceding year.
56 Electra Private Equity PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2008 16 Financial Instruments continued Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements, mitigated by stock selection.
The Group does not use derivatives.
Electra Partners has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
The Group is exposed to the risk of the change in value of its fund investments, listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares, fixed income securities and floating rate notes.
For funds, listed investments and floating rate notes the market risk variable is deemed to be the price itself.
For unlisted equity and non-equity shares the market risk is deemed to be the price earnings ratio.
The impact on profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity, in absolute and percentage terms of those figures, due to movements in these variables, is set out in part ii of this Note.
Credit Risk The Groups exposure to credit risk principally arises from its investment in floating rate notes and its cash deposits.
Only major clearance houses are used when making cash deposits and the level of cash versus floating rate notes is reviewed on a regular basis.
A well diversified portfolio of floating rate notes is maintained with no more than 10% of gross assets held with any one institution.
The total invested in floating rate notes was 274,252,000 with associated accrued interest of 2,215,000 2007: 297,004,000 with associated interest of 2,433,000.
The cost of this investment was 275,528,000 2007: 297,390,000, the variance to valuation is in respect of deal related costs and market pricing.
Cash held on deposit was principally with one UK bank and totalled 43,791,000 2007: 16,948,000.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through retained profits including both realised and unrealised capital profits.
In addition, financing is obtained through loan facilities.
During the year, a long-term multi-currency loan facility was in existence.
The loan has a floating rate of interest.
The cash balances held on deposit mitigate in part the interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk profiles for financial assets and liabilities and the impact of the profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity of a 1.0% increase or decrease in interest rates, in absolute terms and as a percentage of those figures, are shown in part iv of this Note.
These profiles exclude short term debtors and creditors.
Liquidity Risk The Groups assets comprise listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares, fixed income securities and floating rate notes whilst the unlisted equity is intentionally illiquid.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the revolving loan facility, floating rate notes which are relatively liquid and cash which is available on demand.
The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out in part v of this Note.
Capital Risk Management The Groups objective in the management of capital risk is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure.
In doing so the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders whilst remaining within the restrictions imposed by its investment trust status, return capital to shareholders, change level of borrowing in the 250,000,000 committed multi-currency revolving credit facility or issue new shares.
During the year the Group paid a special dividend of 9,149,000 2007: 6,375,000.
In order to be able to pay dividend out of profits available for distribution the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
The Group continued to pursue an active share buy-back policy and to return value to shareholders, manage the levels of cash deposits held whilst maintaining sufficient liquidity for investments.
The 250,000,000 committed multi-currency revolving credit facility was drawn down such that a balance of 158,870,000 was outstanding at the year end 2007: 160,699,000.
The level of outstanding borrowings is reviewed on an ongoing basis taking into account the need to buy back shares, future levels of investment and any foreign currency hedging concerns.

Revenue received in currencies other than sterling is converted into sterling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate.
The treatment of foreign currency transactions has been described in greater detail in the Basis of Accounting note commencing on page 44.
The foreign investments held are principally in the USA, Continental Europe, Latin America and the Far East.
During the year, the Group held loans denominated in US Dollars and Euros, which partially offset foreign currency risk on foreign currency investments.
The ratio of loans held in US Dollar and Euro is under regular review in order to partially hedge as efficiently as possible.
Foreign currency exposures and the impact on profit after tax on shareholders equity of 10% increases and decreases in the value of US Dollar and Euros, in absolute terms and as a percentage of those figures are analysed in part iii of this Note.
