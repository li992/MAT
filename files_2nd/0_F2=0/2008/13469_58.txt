MINING AND TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS Alumina Aluminium oxide.
It is extracted from bauxite in a chemical refining process and is subsequently the principal raw material in the electro-chemical process by which aluminium is produced.
Anode and cathode copper At the final stage of the smelting of copper concentrates, the copper is cast into specially shaped slabs called anodes for subsequent refining to produce refined cathode copper.
Bauxite Mainly hydrated aluminium oxides Al O.
Principal ore of alumina, the raw material 2 3 2 from which aluminium is made.
Bioleaching The deliberate use of bacteria to speed the chemical release of metals from ores.
Block caving An underground bulk mining method.
It involves undercutting the orebody to induce ore fracture and collapse by gravity.
The broken ore is recovered through draw points below.
Borates A generic term for mineral compounds which contain boron and oxygen.
Cathode copper Refined copper produced by electrolytic refining of impure copper or by electro-winning.
Classification Separating crushed and ground ore into portions of different size particles.
Coking coal By virtue of its carbonisation properties, it is used in the manufacture of coke, which is used in the steel making process.
Also known as metallurgical coal.
Concentrate The product of a physical concentration process, such as flotation or gravity concentration, which involves separating ore minerals from unwanted waste rock.
Concentrates require subsequent processing such as smelting or leaching to break down or dissolve the ore minerals and obtain the desired elements, usually metals.
Cutoff grade The lowest grade of mineralised material considered economic to process.
It is used in the calculation of the quantity of ore present in a given deposit.
Flotation A method of separating finely ground minerals using a froth created in water by specific reagents.
In the flotation process certain mineral particles are induced to float by becoming attached to bubbles of froth whereas others, usually unwanted, sink.
Grade The proportion of metal or mineral present in ore, or any other host material, expressed in this document as per cent, grams per tonne or ounces per ton.
Head grade The average grade of ore delivered to the mill.
Ilmenite Mineral composed of iron, titanium and oxygen.
Metallurgical coal By virtue of its carbonisation properties, it is used in the manufacture of coke, which is used in the steel making process.
Also known as coking coal.
Mineral resource A concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic interest in or on the Earths crust in such form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.
Mineral resources are sub-divided in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.
Rio Tinto 2008 Annual report 177 Definitions and exchange rates continued Ore A rock from which a metal s or mineral s can be economically and legally extracted.
Ore milled The quantity of ore processed.
Ore reserve The economically mineable part of a Measured and or Indicated Mineral Resource.
It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the materials are mined.
Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified.
Ore Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable Ore Reserves and Proved Ore Reserves.
Rock mined The quantity of ore and waste rock excavated from the mine.
In this document, the term is only applied to surface mining operations.
Rutile A mineral composed of titanium and oxygen TiO.
2 Stripping ratio The tonnes of waste material which must be removed to allow the mining of one tonne of ore. Solvent extraction and Processes for extracting metal from an ore and producing pure metal.
First the metal is leached electrowinning SX-EW into solution: the resulting solution is then purified in the solvent extraction process: the solution is then treated in an electro-chemical process electro-winning to recover cathode copper.
Tailing The rock wastes which are rejected from a concentrating process after the recoverable valuable minerals have been extracted.
Titanium dioxide feedstock A feedstock rich in titanium dioxide, produced, in Rio Tintos case, by smelting ores containing titanium minerals.
