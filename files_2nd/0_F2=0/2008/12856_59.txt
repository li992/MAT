The average share price in the year was 186p 2007: 185p.
For the 2003 Share Option scheme, there was a pre-bonus issue-weighted average share price of 1 and a weighted average exercise price of 1 based on third-party transactions in the Companys shares in the period immediately prior to the issue of the share options.
Prior to IPO in February 2006 there was no active market for the Companys shares therefore expected volatility was determined using the average volatility for a comparable selection of businesses.
At this time the Group had no established pattern of dividend payments therefore no dividends were assumed in this model.
