a summary of the more important Company accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
there is no material difference between the profit on ordinary activities before taxation and the retained profit for the year and their historical cost equivalents.
the principal activity of the Company is to act as a holding company.
under financial Reporting standard 1, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that its consolidated financial statements, which include the Company, are publicly available.
Adoption of new Accounting Standards and pronouncements the Company has adopted the following amendments to financial Reporting standards: amendment to fRs17 Retirement Benefits amendment to fRs26 financial instruments: measurement the adoption of these amendments to fRss has had no impact on the financial statements of the Company at 30 april 2008. expenditure expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Investments the parent Companys investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value.
taxation the taxation expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Company financial statements.
however, the deferred income tax is not accounted for, if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Company and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
pension costs Pension contributions under defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
for the defined benefit pension scheme, a valuation is performed every three years.
the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the defined benefit scheme and accordingly accounts for the plan as if it was a defined contribution plan.
Share-based payments the fair value of awards under the Companys long-term incentive Plans are charged against profit on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the awards, based on the Companys estimate of awards that will eventually vest.
shares held in trust to satisfy these awards are treated as a deduction from shareholders funds.
