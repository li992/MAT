Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Reporting Entity Heritage Oil Limited the Company was incorporated under the Companies Jersey Law 1991 as amended on 6 February 2008.
Its primary business activity is the exploration, development and production of petroleum and natural gas in Africa, the Middle East, Russia and South Asia.
The Company was established in order to implement a corporate reorganisation of Heritage Oil Corporation HOC, the Corporation.
On 24 March 2008, HOC entered into a corporate reorganisation the Reorganisation which resulted in the Company becoming the parent company of HOC and its subsidiaries.
The Companys corporate head office is now located in the Channel Islands.
In connection with the Reorganisation, the Company listed its Ordinary Shares Ordinary Shares on the Official List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority the UKLA and trades on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange plc the LSE collectively, Admission.
HOC delisted its existing Common Shares Heritage Shares from the Toronto Stock Exchange the TSX and obtained a listing for a new class of Exchangeable Shares the Exchangeable Shares on the TSX.
As part of the Reorganisation, implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement the Arrangement under the Business Corporations Act Alberta, HOC split its stock such that each existing HOC Share was exchanged for either ten Ordinary Shares or 10 Exchangeable Shares in accordance with the terms of the Arrangement.
On 2 April 2008, HOC and the Company collectively, together with their subsidiaries and affiliates, announced that Articles of Arrangement implementing the previously announced Arrangement involving HOC and the Company had been filed with the Registrar of Corporations for the Province of Alberta with an effective date of 31 March 2008.
As a result, former holders of Common Shares of HOC were entitled to either 10 Ordinary Shares of the Company or ten Exchangeable Shares of HOC for each Common Share held depending on the elections previously made by such shareholders.
Effective at the opening of business on 3 April 2008, the Exchangeable Shares were listed and posted for trading in substitution for the previously listed Common Shares of HOC which were delisted at that time.
The Exchangeable Shares were also admitted to trading on the Main Market of the LSE on 2 April 2008.
Trading of Ordinary Shares commenced on the LSE on 31 March 2008.
The Exchangeable Shares are designed to have rights as near as possible equivalent to the Ordinary Shares of the Company.
Each Exchangeable Share is exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for an Ordinary Share.
The holders of Exchangeable Shares are entitled to Voting Rights equivalent to Ordinary Shares through the Special Voting Share see below.
Dividends to Ordinary Shareholders can only be declared or paid simultaneously with the declaration or payment of an identical dividend to Exchangeable Shareholders.
On liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of HOC, the Exchangeable Shareholders will be given one Ordinary Share per Exchangeable Share held.
The Company has issued one Special Voting Share.
The Special Voting Share has the number of votes, which may be cast at any meeting at which holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to vote, equal to the number of Exchangeable Shares of HOC outstanding at the relevant time.
The holders of Exchangeable Shares are entitled to Voting Rights through the Special Voting Share held by the trustee of the Voting and Exchange Trust by the Company, and have the right to receive notice of, speak and vote at the general meetings of the Company on the basis of one vote for every Exchangeable Share on the same basis as if they had exchanged their Exchangeable Shares for Ordinary Shares.
In connection with this Reorganisation the Company has agreed that the 2007 convertible bonds outstanding were convertible into Ordinary Shares of the Company rather than Common Shares of HOC.
These consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company and all subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control.
The Company together with its subsidiaries are referred to as the Group.
The subsidiaries consolidated within these financial statements include, inter alia, Heritage Oil Corporation, Heritage Oil & Gas Limited, Eagle Energy Oman Limited, Heritage Oil and Gas U Limited, Heritage Energy Middle East Limited, Heritage DRC Limited, Coatbridge Estates Limited, ChumpassNefteDobycha, Neftyanaya Geologicheskaya Kompaniya, Heritage Oil & Gas Austria GesmbH, Heritage Mali Block 7 Limited, Heritage Mali Block 11 Limited, Heritage Energy Holding GesmbH, Heritage Oil & Gas Gibraltar Limited, TISE Heritage Neftegaz, Begal Air Limited, Heritage International Holding GesmbH, Heritage Oil & Gas Holdings Limited, Eagle Drill Limited, Heritage Oil Barbados Limited, Heritage Oil & Gas Switzerland SA, Heritage Oil International Malta Limited, 1381890 Alberta ULC, Heritage Oil Cooperatief U.
A, Heritage Oil Holdings Limited, Heritage International VOF, Heritage International Holding Gibraltar Limited, Heritage Tanzania Kimbiji-Latham Limited and Heritage Tanzania Kisangire Limited.
The Companys consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
The financial statements were approved by the Board and authorised for issuance on 28 April 2009.
2 Significant Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 57 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 Significant Accounting Policies continued a Basis of Preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Reorganisation, which is not a business combination, was accounted for with reference to the principles of reverse acquisition accounting as in accounting terms, the substance of the Reorganisation is that the underlying economics of the business have remained unchanged.
Accordingly, the Reorganisation has been accounted for on a carry over basis of the historical cost of assets and liabilities of HOC and the consolidated financial history of HOC becomes that of the Company.
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
As for most oil and gas exploration companies, the Company raises financing for its activities from time to time using a variety of sources.
Based on its current plans and knowledge, its projected capital expenditure and operating cash requirements, the Group has sufficient cash to finance its current plans for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements, but further finance is likely to be required to meet expenditure planned for the second half of 2010.
Sources of funding for future exploration and development programmes will be derived from, inter alia, new credit facilities, reinvesting funds from operations, using existing treasury resources, disposal proceeds from the sale of non-core assets, farm-outs and, when considered appropriate, issuing debt and additional equity.
Accordingly, the Group has a number of different sources of finance available and the Directors are confident that additional finance will be raised as and when needed.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Operations Review of the Annual Report on pages 10 to 27.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Chief Financial Officers Financial Review on pages 28 to 31.
In addition, note 3 to the financial statements includes the Groups policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management, and its exposure to foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 4. b Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of the Company as at 31 December 2008 and 2007 and the results of all subsidiaries for the years then ended.
Subsidiaries are all entities including special purpose entities over which the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, so as to obtain benefits from its activities, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Company controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group entities the Company and its subsidiaries are eliminated.
For the purposes of consolidation, the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Company.
58 Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 2 Significant Accounting Policies continued c Segment Reporting The Companys primary segment reporting format is geographical.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment, that are subject to risks and returns, that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
d Joint Arrangements The majority of exploration, development and production activities are conducted jointly with others under contractual arrangement and, accordingly, the Group only reflects its proportionate interest in such assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
e Exploration and Evaluation Expenditures The Group applies a modified full cost method of accounting for exploration and evaluation E&E costs, having regard to the requirements of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.
Under the modified full cost method of accounting, costs of exploring for and evaluating oil and gas properties are capitalised on a licence or prospect basis and the resulting assets are tested for impairment by reference to appropriate cost pools.
Such cost pools are based on geographic areas and are not larger than a segment.
The Group had nine cost pools in 2007 and 2008: Uganda, Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Russia, Oman, DRC, Pakistan, Malta, Mali and Tanzania.
E&E costs related to each licence prospect are initially capitalised within Intangible exploration assets.
Such E&E costs may include costs of licence acquisition, technical services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploration drilling and testing, the projected costs of retiring the assets if any and directly attributable general and administrative expenses, but do not include costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area, which are expensed directly to the income statement as they are incurred.
Where the Company farms-in to licences and incurs costs in excess of its own share of licence costs as consideration, these costs are capitalised as its own share.
Tangible assets acquired for use in E&E activities are classified as property, plant and equipment: however, to the extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset.
Intangible E&E assets related to each exploration licence prospect are not depreciated and are carried forward until the existence or otherwise of commercial reserves has been determined.
The Groups definition of commercial reserves for such purpose is proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis.
Proved and probable reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of certainty see below to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible.
There should be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated as proved and probable and a 50% statistical probability that it will be less.
The equivalent statistical probabilities for the proved component of proved and probable reserves are 90% and 10%, respectively.
Such reserves may be considered commercially producible if management has the intention of developing and producing them and such intention is based upon: a reasonable assessment of the future economics of such production: a reasonable expectation that there is a market for all or substantially all the expected hydrocarbon production: and evidence that the necessary production, transmission and transportation facilities are available or can be made available.
Furthermore: i Reserves may only be considered proved and probable if producibility is supported by either actual production or a conclusive formation test.
The area of reservoir considered proved includes: a that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas-oil and or oil-water contacts, if any, or both: and b the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geophysical, geological and engineering data.
In the absence of information on fluid contacts, the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir: and ii Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are only included in the proved and probable classification when successful testing by a pilot project, the operation of an installed programme in the reservoir, or other reasonable evidence such as, experience of the same techniques on similar reservoirs or reservoir simulation studies provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or programme was based.
If commercial reserves have been discovered, the related E&E assets are assessed for impairment on a cost pool basis as set out below and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets is then reclassified as development and production assets within property, plant and equipment.
Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 59 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 Significant Accounting Policies continued E&E assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount.
Such indicators include the point at which a determination is made as to whether or not commercial reserves exist.
Where the E&E assets concerned fall within the scope of an established full cost pool, the E&E assets are tested for impairment together with all development and production assets associated with that cost pool, as a single cash generating unit.
The aggregate carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the pool, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves.
Where the E&E assets to be tested fall outside the scope of any established cost pool, there will generally be no commercial reserves and the E&E assets concerned will be written-off in full.
f Property, Plant and Equipment i Development and Production Assets The Group had two interests at the development and production stage during the years covered by these financial statements: Russia and Oman.
Development and production assets are accumulated on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets as outlined above, the projected cost of retiring the assets and directly attributable general and administrative expenses.
The net book values of producing assets are depleted on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production method by reference to the ratio of production in the year to the related proved plus probable reserves of the field, taking into account estimated future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The aggregate carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the cash generating unit, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from the production of commercial reserves.
The cash generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows generated by the fields are interdependent.
ii Other Assets Other property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
The assets useful lives and residual values are assessed on an annual basis.
Furniture and fittings are depreciated using the reducing balance method at 20% per year.
Land is not subject to depreciation.
Drilling rig equipment is depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on 2,740 drilling days with a 20% residual value.
The corporate jet is depreciated over its expected useful life of 69 months.
Depreciation is charged so as to write-off the cost, less estimated residual value of corporate jet on a straight-line basis.
Corporate capital assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The building is depreciated on a straightline basis over 40 years with nil residual value.
The land is not depreciated.
g Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Cash and cash equivalents are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
h Trade and Other Receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
i Inventories Inventories consist of petroleum, condensate, liquid petroleum gas and materials that are recorded at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials, direct labour, depletion and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
60 Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 2 Significant Accounting Policies continued j Intangible Development Costs Development costs are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will, after considering its commercial and technical feasibility, be completed and generate future economic benefits and its costs can be measured reliably.
All other research and development costs are charged to earnings in the year incurred.
k Investments The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the income statement and availablefor-sale financial assets.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition.
During the years covered by these financial statements the Group did not have any investments classified as loans and receivables or held to maturity investments.
i Financial Assets at Fair Value Through the Income Statement Financial assets held for trading are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Derivatives are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through the income statement category are presented in the income statement within Unrealised gain loss on other financial assets in the year in which they arise.
ii Available-For-Sale Financial Assets Available-for-sale financial assets, comprising principally marketable equity securities, are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale other than impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in the income statement are recognised in equity.
Upon sale of a security classified as available-for-sale, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Measurement is assessed by reference to the fair value of the financial asset or group of financial assets.
l Non-Current Assets Held for Sale Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as assets held for sale and stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Non-current assets including those that are part of a disposal group are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale.
Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as assets held for sale are presented separately, as current assets, from the other assets in the balance sheet.
The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately, as current liabilities, from other liabilities in the balance sheet.
m Trade and Other Payables These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year which are unpaid.
n Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption amount is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Convertible bonds are separated into liability and derivative liability components being the bondholders conversion option and each component is recognised separately.
On initial recognition, the fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
The fair value of the derivative liability component see note 2q is determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, and this amount is recorded as a liability.
Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in finance income or costs.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 61 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 Significant Accounting Policies continued o Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale.
Other borrowing costs are expensed.
The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs to be capitalised is the weighted average interest rate applicable to the Groups outstanding borrowings during the year.
p Provisions Asset Retirement Obligations Provision is made for the estimated cost of any asset retirement obligations when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Asset retirement obligation expense is capitalised in the relevant asset category unless it arises from the normal course of production activities.
Provisions are measured at the present value of managements best estimate of expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation, the obligation is adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as finance costs whereas increase due to changes in the estimated future cash flows are capitalised.
q Derivative Financial Liabilities Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date.
Changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
r Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of petroleum and natural gas is recognised at the fair value received or receivable and is recorded when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product are transferred to the buyer.
For sales of oil and gas this is usually when legal title passes to the external party which occurs on shipment of oil and gas to the buyer.
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method.
s Income Taxes Current income tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups current tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.
t Foreign Currency Translation Items included in the financial statements of each of the Companys consolidated subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates the functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
62 Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 2 Significant Accounting Policies continued The results and financial position of all the Companys consolidated subsidiaries none of which has a functional currency that is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: i assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: ii income and expenses for each year are translated at average exchange rates unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions : and iii all resulting exchange differences are recognised as either income or expense in a separate component of equity.
Foreign currency loans and overdrafts are designated as, and are considered to be, hedges of the exchange rate exposure inherent in foreign currency net investments and, to the extent that the hedge is effective, exchange differences giving rise to changes in the carrying value of foreign currency loans are also recognised as income or expense directly in equity.
All other exchange differences giving rise to changes in the carrying value of foreign currency loans and overdrafts are recognised in the income statement.
When a foreign operation is sold, a proportionate share of the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in equity are recognised in the income statement, as part of the gain or loss on sale where applicable.
u Share-Based Compensation Plans The Group applies the fair value method of accounting to all equity classified share-based compensation arrangements for both employees and non-employees.
Compensation cost of equity classified awards to employees are measured at fair value of the awards at the time when the services are rendered at the grant date and recognised over the periods during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The compensation cost is charged to the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.
The compensation cost of equity classified awards to non-employees is initially measured at fair value, and periodically remeasured to fair value until the non-employees performance is complete, and recognised over their vesting period with a corresponding increase to share-based payment reserve.
Upon the exercise of the award, consideration received is recognised in equity.
See note 21. v Share Capital Ordinary and Exchangeable Shares are classified as share capital.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
If the Company re-acquires its own equity instruments the cost is deducted from equity and the associated shares are cancelled.
w Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the financial period.
The rights of different classes of shares are the same and therefore economically equivalent.
As such, Ordinary and Exchangeable Shares are treated as one class of shares for the earnings per share calculation.
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential Ordinary Shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The if-converted method used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes the conversion of convertible securities at the later of the beginning of the reported period or issuance date, if dilutive.
In all cases, the weighted average number of shares used has been adjusted to reflect the effective one for ten share split that took place as part of the corporate reorganisation described in note 1. x New Accounting Standards and Interpretations Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Companys assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations which have not been adopted is set out below.
i IFRS 8, Operating segments effective from 1 January 2009, replaces International Accounting Standard IAS 14 and aligns segment reporting with the requirements of the US standard Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.
The new standard requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
The expected impact is still being assessed by management, but is expected to only impact the disclosures of the Group.
The following standard is assessed not to have any impact on the Companys financial statements: i IAS 23 Amendment, Borrowing costs effective from 1 January 2009, requires the Group to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of that asset.
The Group currently applies the capitalisation approach to borrowing costs.
Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 63 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 Significant Accounting Policies continued The following amendments have been published, but have not been applied in these financial statements: i IFRS 2 Amendment, Share-based payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009: i IFRS 3 Amendment Business Combinations: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009: iii IAS 1 Amendment, Presentation of Financial Statements: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009: and iv IAS 27 Amendment, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these amendments will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
3 Risk Management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks that arise as a result of its exploration, development, production, and financing activities.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
a Financial Risk Management i Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk arises when transactions and recognised assets and liabilities of the Group entity concerned are denominated in a currency that is not the Companys functional currency.
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency exposures to the US dollar.
There are no forward exchange rate contracts in place at, or subsequent to, 31 December 2008.
At 31 December 2008, if the Canadian dollar had strengthened weakened by 10% against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, the loss for the year would have been $122,403 31 December 2007 $2,978,702 higher lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of Canadian dollar denominated general and administrative expenses and cash in bank.
Profit is more sensitive to movement of Canadian US dollar exchange rates in 2007 than 2008 because of significantly higher general and administrative expenses in 2007 in comparison with 2008.
At 31 December 2008, if the Russian rouble had strengthened weakened by 10% against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, the loss for the year would have been $ 513,633 31 December 2007 $ 329,361 higher lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of Russian rouble denominated cash in bank and monetary assets and liabilities.
At 31 December 2008, if the Pounds Sterling had strengthened weakened by 10% against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, the loss for the year would have been $605,907 31 December 2007 $343,011 higher lower, mainly as a result of Pounds Sterling denominated general and administrative expenses and foreign exchange gains losses on translation of Pounds Sterling denominated long-term loan.
At 31 December 2008, if the Swiss franc had strengthened weakened by 10% against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, the loss for the year would have been $ 299,806 31 December 2007 $ 420,274 higher lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of Swiss franc denominated cash at bank.
ii Commodity Price Risk The Company is exposed to commodity price risk to the extent that it sells its entitlement to petroleum, condensate and liquid petroleum gas production on a floating price basis.
The Company may consider partly mitigating this risk in the future.
The table below summarises the impact of increases decreases of the relevant oil condensate LPG benchmark on the Companys loss for the year.
The analysis is based on the assumption that commodity prices had increased decreased by 5% with all other variables held constant: Year ended 31 December 2008 2007 $ $ Brent light crude 191,850 85,886 Condensate 48,190 77,831 LPG 14,751 21,759 254,791 185,476 The loss for the year would increase decrease as a result of commodity revenues received.
64 Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 3 Risk Management continued iii Interest Rate Risk The Group had fixed rate long-term debt and fixed rate convertible bonds in the years under review, therefore, it was not exposed to interest rate risk with respect to these fixed-rate borrowings.
In October 2007, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company received a long-term loan of $9,450,000 with a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.6% note 16.
An increase decrease of LIBOR by 1% would result in an increase decrease of the Companys loss for the year by $73,375 31 December 2007 $17,325.
iv Credit Risk All of the Companys production was derived from Russia and Oman.
In 2007 and 2008, the Company made all of its production sales, at any point in time, in each country to a single customer for each commodity.
Accordingly, substantially all the Companys accounts receivables from petroleum and natural gas sales were from a maximum of three customers during these years.
Trade debtors of the Company are subject to internal credit review to minimise the risk of non-payment.
The Company does not anticipate any defaults as it transacts with creditworthy counterparties.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting years and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The Company is also exposed to credit risk in relation to regular joint venture billings which are typically outstanding for one month and in relation to its cash balances held with the reputable banks.
v Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet liabilities.
Cash forecasts identifying liquidity requirements of the Group are produced quarterly.
These are reviewed regularly to ensure sufficient funds exist to finance the Companys current operational and investment cash flow requirements.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Companys cash position on the basis of expected cash flow.
The Group had available cash of $91 million at 31 December 2008.
Based on its current plans and knowledge, its projected capital expenditure and operating cash requirements, the Group has sufficient cash to finance its current plans for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements, but further financing is likely to be required to meet expenditures planned for the second half of 2010.
The Companys financial liabilities consist of trade and other payables and borrowings.
Trade and other payables are due within 12 months, and borrowings fall due as outlined in note 24. b Capital Risk Management The Companys objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Companys ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In accordance with the terms of the convertible bonds, the Company shall not, over the life of the convertible bonds note 16, make any dividend payment or share repurchase.
The Company monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including borrowings and trade and other payables as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
As at 31 December 2008 2007 $ $ Total borrowings 237,462,452 216,434,761 Less cash and cash equivalents note 14 90,620,385 230,089,323 Net debt cash 146,842,067 13,654,562 Total equity 163,835,069 193,193,432 Total capital 310,677,136 193,193,432 Gearing ratio 47% 0% This increase in the gearing ratio during 2008 resulted primarily from an increase in accounts payable at 31 December 2008 due to the significant exploration activities at the end of the year and a decrease in equity due to the net loss incurred during 2008.
Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 65 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 4 Critical Accounting Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements In the process of applying the Companys accounting policies, which are described in note 2, management makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: a Recoverability of Exploration and Evaluation Costs Under the modified full cost method of accounting for E&E costs, certain costs are capitalised as intangible assets by reference to appropriate cost pools, and are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable value.
Such circumstances include, but are not limited to: i the period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the period, or will expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed: ii substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted nor planned: iii exploration for, and evaluation of, mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area: and iv sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.
This assessment involves judgement as to: i the likely future commerciality of the asset and when such commerciality should be determined: ii future revenues and costs pertaining to any wider cost pool with which the asset in question is associated: and iii the discount rate to be applied to such revenues and costs for the purpose of deriving a recoverable value.
Note 10 discloses the carrying amounts of the Groups E&E assets.
Consequently, major uncertainties affect the recoverability of these costs which is dependent on the Group achieving commercial production or the sale of the assets.
Note 24 discloses contingencies relating to the title risks.
The Company assessed whether these risks are contingencies or indicators of impairment and concluded that they are contingencies.
b Reserve Estimates Estimates of recoverable quantities of proven and probable reserves include assumptions regarding commodity prices, exchange rates, discount rates, production and transportation costs for future cash flows.
It also requires interpretation of complex and difficult geological and geophysical models in order to make an assessment of the size, shape, depth, and quality of reservoirs and their anticipated recoveries.
The economic, geological and technical factors used to estimate reserves may change from period to period.
Changes in reported reserves can impact asset carrying values and the asset retirement obligation due to changes in expected future cash flows.
Reserves are integral to the amount of depletion charged to the income statement and the calculation of inventory.
The level of estimated commercial reserves is also a key determinant in assessing whether the carrying value of any of the Groups development and production assets has been impaired.
c Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Groups accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of the fair value of financial instruments.
Fair values have been determined for measurement and or disclosure purposes based on the following methods: i Non-Derivative Financial Instruments These comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through the income statement, any directly attributable transaction costs.
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the applicable market rate of interest at the reporting date.
ii Derivatives Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value: attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement when incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value.
Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through the income statement.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on their listed market prices, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate based on government bonds.
66 Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 4 Critical Accounting Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements continued iii Compound Financial Instruments Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible bonds that can be converted to share capital at the option of the holder, and the number of shares to be issued does not vary with changes in their fair value.
The convertible bonds are separated into liability and derivative liability components being the bondholders conversion option.
The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at fair value, determined by reference to market interest rates for equivalent bonds which do not contain conversion features.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The fair value of the derivative liability component is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and this amount is recorded as a liability.
The Black-Scholes model contains assumptions and determinations pertaining to volatility, risk-free interest rates, and the terms of the options see note 22.
5 Segment Information The Group has a single class of business which is international exploration, development and production of petroleum oil and natural gas.
In 2007 and 2008, the Group operated in a number of geographical areas based on the location of operations and assets: Russia, Oman, Uganda, DRC, Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Pakistan, Tanzania, Malta and Mali.
2 Kurdistan Region of Iraq information was not a separate geographic segment as defined in note 2c until October 2007.
However, information is presented to conform with the current year presentation.
Exploration expenditures in respect of E&E assets relate to pre-licence costs which are expensed in accordance with IFRS 6.

7 Income Tax Expense The Group is subject to income taxes in Canada, Uganda and Russia.
All of the Groups operating activities are outside of Jersey.
In Oman, the tax rate applicable to the Groups operations is considered to be nil as in this jurisdiction the Group is subject to a production sharing agreement.
In Canada, Uganda and Russia, the Group has available tax deductions of $31,438,808 31 December 2007 $37,624,932 and tax losses of $93,531,776 31 December 2007 $77,749,022, of which $50,915,869 expires from 2009 to 2028, and the remaining $42,615,907 does not have an expiry period.
No deferred tax assets have been recognised for the benefit of tax deductions and tax losses because realisation of the deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future is not sufficiently likely.

The carrying value of the drilling rig was written down to nil because management does not expect that there will be significant drilling services revenues generated from the use of the drilling rig.
This resulted in an impairment write-down of $749,955 2007 $1,799,762 recognised in the income statement during the year ended 31 December 2008.
Impairment tests were performed for development and producing assets for a variety of scenarios using after tax discount rates in the range from 10% to 15%.
The trigger for the impairment tests was a decline in oil and gas prices during 2008.
As a result of the impairment test, the carrying value of the petroleum and natural gas interest in Oman was written down to its fair value of $28 million.
This resulted in an impairment write-down of $3,247,078 2007 nil recognised in the income statement during the year ended 31 December 2008.
The impairment tests indicated that the fair value of the Companys development and producing assets in Russia significantly exceeds its book value.

The investment in unlisted securities represents common shares in a private company named SeaDragon, which is classified as available-for-sale.
There were no other disposals or impairment losses on held for trading or available-for-sale financial assets in the reporting years under these financial statements.
The Company owns 805,832 of the unlisted shares of SeaDragon, representing approximately 15% of the shares outstanding.
These are carried at a value of $4 per share, based on the most recent private placement of SeaDragon on 26 October 2006.
At year end, the value of the shares could not be measured reliably as SeaDragon is in the process of financial reorganisation and there is a wide range of possible values for the shares and the resulting outcome of the alternatives cannot be determined.
Management of the Company has no reason to believe that the value of the investment in the shares of SeaDragon is lower than the carrying value and, therefore, there is no need for an impairment write-down of the Companys investment in the shares of SeaDragon.
The Company does not plan to dispose of its investment in shares of SeaDragon in the forseeable future.

Issue costs amounted to $6,979,268 resulting in net proceeds of $158,020,732.
The Company issued 1,650 unsecured convertible bonds at par, which have a maturity of five years and one day and an annual coupon of 8% payable semi-annually on 17 August and 17 February of each year.
Bondholders have the right to convert the bonds into Ordinary Shares at a price of $4.70 per share after one for ten split note 1 at any time.
The number of Ordinary Shares receivable on conversion of the bonds is fixed.
The Company had the right to redeem, in whole or part, the bonds for cash at any time on or before 16 February 2008, at 150% of par value.
This right was not exercised.
Proceeds were used to finance the redemption of all outstanding 10% convertible bonds issued on 26 March 2006, at a premium of 150% and for general corporate funding purposes.
Bondholders have a put option requiring the Company to redeem the bonds at par, plus accrued interest, in the event of a change of control of the Company or revocation or surrender of the Zapadno Chumpasskoye Licence in Russia.
In the event of a change of control and redemption of the bonds or exercise of the conversion rights, a cash payment of up to $19,700 on each $100,000 bond will be made to the bondholder, the amount of which depends upon the date of redemption and market value of shares at the date of any change of control event.
The bonds included conversion features which in certain circumstances could be settled in cash and so these features represent a derivative financial instrument which is classified as a liability.
The fair value of the liability component of the bonds net of issue costs was estimated at $140,154,215.
The fair value of the derivative financial liability representing the bondholders conversion feature note 22 net of issue costs was estimated at $17,866,517 on 16 February 2007.
The difference between the $165,000,000 due on maturity and the initial liability component is accreted using the effective interest method and is recorded as finance costs.
The derivative financial instrument is recorded at fair value with resulting gains and losses recorded in finance income and costs.
In July 2007, a bondholder with $7 million of bonds gave notice of the exercise of 70 bonds and received 148,937 Common Shares in August 2007.
As a result of this conversion, $8,944,487 was transferred to Share Capital from convertible bonds, derivative liability component of convertible bonds and accrued liabilities.
In April 2009, bondholders with $5.9 million of bonds gave notices of the exercise of 59 bonds.
These bondholders received 1,255,317 Ordinary Shares see note 26.

Interest on the loan is fixed at 6.515% for the first five years and is then variable at a rate of London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus 1.35%.
The loan, which is secured on the property, is scheduled to be repaid by 240 instalments of capital and interest at monthly intervals, subject to a residual debt at the end of the term of the loan of $3.5 million 1,860,000.
The current principal balance outstanding as at 31 December 2008 was $6,155,882 4.2 million 31 December 2007 $8,519,037 4.3 million.

Each installment equals to $117,500 with the final installment being $7,217,500.
The Corporation provided a corporate guarantee to the lender.
Fair Values At 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008, the fair values of borrowings are approximately equal to their carrying amounts as the facilities bear interest at market rates of interest.

The Companys authorised share capital is an unlimited number of Ordinary Shares without par value.
At incorporation, there was one Ordinary Share issued at $42.
On 22 February 2008, a second Ordinary Share was issued at $41.
As part of the Reorganisation note 1, the Corporation split its stock such that each existing Common Share of the Corporation was exchanged for either ten Ordinary Shares or ten Exchangeable Shares.
The Corporation was a US dollar functional currency entity as is the Company and therefore the balance of Share Capital was carried forward at its historical amount into the financial statements of the Company.
As such, Ordinary and Exchangeable Shares were treated as one class of shares for loss per share calculation.
Information about movements in share capital issued before the Reorganisation is presented in the table below on the after split basis, i. e. taking into account, the one for ten split.

ii Foreign Currency Translation Reserve Exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign controlled entity are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve, as described in note 2t.
The reserve will be recognised in the income statement when the net investment is disposed.
iii Share-Based Payments Reserve The share-based payments reserve, as described in note 2u, is used to recognise the fair value of options and LTIP awards issued, but not exercised, to employees.
20 Loss per Share The following table summarises the weighted average Ordinary and Exchangeable Shares used in calculating net earnings per share: Year ended 31 December 2008 2007 Weighted average Ordinary and Exchangeable Shares Basic 254,969,021 227,504,282 Diluted 256,257,622 237,562,982 76 Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 20 Loss per Share continued The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the effective one for ten share split that took place as part of the corporate reorganisation described in note 18.
The reconciling item between basic and diluted weighted average number of Ordinary Shares is the dilutive effect of stock options.
A total of 22,232,010 options 31 December 2007 nil, 4,926,429 of shares relating to the LTIP 31 December 2007 nil and 33,617,020 of shares relating to the convertible bonds 31 December 2007 33,617,020 were excluded from the above calculation, as they were anti-dilutive.
21 Share-Based Payments Stock Options The Company had a stock option plan whereby certain Directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Group have been granted options to purchase Ordinary Shares.
Under the terms of the plan, options granted normally vest one-third immediately and one-third in each of the years following the date granted and have a life of 5 years.
As part of the Reorganisation note 1 the 2008 Replacement Share Option Scheme the 2008 Scheme was adopted.
The 2008 Scheme served as a replacement of the Stock Option Plan of HOC which was cancelled just after the Reorganisation of HOC and its subsidiaries companies which occurred on 31 March 2008.
Pursuant to the Reorganisation, the HOC optionholders exchanged each outstanding option to acquire a Common Share in the capital of HOC for ten options to acquire ten Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company.
The HOC optionholders were put in substantially the same economic position in the Company that they were in prior to the Reorganisation.
The exercise prices of the options to acquire Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company are expressed in Pounds Sterling and represent the exercise prices of the HOCs options, expressed in Canadian dollars, translated at the exchange rate at 31 March 2008.
Information about stock options granted before the Reorganisation is presented in the tables below on the same basis as it is stipulated by the 2008 Scheme, i. e. after taking into account the one for ten exchange and translation of exercise prices to Pounds Sterling.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP On 19 June 2008, the AGM of the Company approved the 2008 LTIP.
Under the terms of the plan, the LTIP awards will be in the form of full-value shares Performance Shares, subject to performance and time-vesting conditions.
Eligible employees will normally be considered by the Remuneration Committee for an award once each year.
Awards, made, to the Executive Directors of the Company under the LTIP are called First Awards.
Participants in the First Award, however, will not be entitled to any further awards until the 2011 financial year.
Awards will normally be made during the period of 42 days following the announcement of year end or half-year financial results.
Exceptionally, the First Awards under the plan, on 19 June 2008, were permitted to be made within 42 days following approval of the LTIP at the June 2008 AGM.
The plan is intended to apply to Executive Directors and other employees in senior management or leadership roles.
By exception, other higher performing and high potential employees may be considered for awards.
Participants in the LTIP will not be entitled to any further awards under the 2008 Scheme.
Heritage Oil Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2008 77 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 21 Share-Based Payments continued The vesting of shares under award are subject to performance conditions agreed by the Remuneration Committee when the award is made.
For the First Awards made in 2008 the performance conditions are relative TSR capital gain plus dividends performance of the Company versus that of a comparator group of international oil companies and a requirement for the share price of the Company to have increased by 20% over the vesting period of three years.
Furthermore there is an additional holding period of one year following the awards vesting.
The Remuneration Committee in consultation with executive reward consultants, approved grants of shares to Executive Directors, senior management and other employees in leadership roles under the LTIP.
The maximum annual, individual award for participants who are not executive directors is 250% of base package expressed as the face value of the shares.
The First Award to executive directors is 1,200% of base package for the CEO and 800% of base package for the CFO.
The First Awards vest after three years provided that the performance conditions are met.
The awards granted to senior management and other employees in leadership roles are in three tranches that vest after three, four and five years respectively, provided that the performance condition is met at that time.
The award would vest in line with the following schedule: Senior management and other First Awards employees in leadership role TSR Performance vs Comparator Group of 18 companies proportion vesting award proportion vesting 3rd place and above 100% of the award 100% of the award 4th place 80% 100% 5th place 50% 100% 6th place 30% 100% 7th place and below 0% 100% 9th place median 0% 100% 10th place and below 0% 0% TSR is measured in comparison to a peer group of 18 oil companies selected based on one of, or a combination of, size market capitalisation, revenue, turnover, cash expenditure or a combination thereof, area of operations and country of domicile.
The TSR measurement is conducted by independent consultants in discussion with the Remuneration Committee.
Since there are market-related conditions the awards of the shares under LTIP were fair valued using the Monte Carlo model which takes into account the market-based performance conditions which effectively estimate the number of shares expected to vest.
No subsequent adjustment is made to the fair value charge for shares that do not vest in the event that these performance conditions are not met.
Adjustments are, however, made for leavers.
The fair value of the awards is recognised as an employee expense with the corresponding increase in equity.
The total amount to be expensed is spread over the vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares and options.
The table below summarises the main assumptions used to fair value the awards made under the above LTIP and the fair values of the shares granted.

The fair value of the convertible bonds conversion option has been estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at each period end, with changes in the fair value of the conversion option recognised in income during the period.
The volatility used in the fair value calculation is 56.13% 31 December 2007 53.85%.
23 Related Party Transactions During the year ended 31 December 2008, the Company incurred transportation costs of $134,978 31 December 2007 nil with respect to the services provided by a company indirectly owned by Mr. Anthony Buckingham, CEO and a Director of the Company.

In many of the countries in which the Group operates, land title systems are not developed to the extent found in many industrial countries and there may be no concept of registered title.
Although the Group believes that it has title to its oil and gas properties, it cannot control or completely protect itself against the risk of title disputes or challenges.
There can be no assurance that claims or challenges by third parties against the Groups properties will not be asserted at a future date.
The Group received a letter from the Iraq Ministry of Oil dated 17 December 2007 stating that the PSC signed with the KRG without the prior approval of the Iraqi government is considered to be void by the Iraqi government as they have stated it violates the prevailing Iraqi law.
The Directors believe that the PSC is valid and effective pursuant to the applicable laws.
In addition, the DRC work programme pursuant to the PSC cannot be commenced prior to the grant of a Presidential Decree from the DRC government.
There can be no assurance that final approval or ratification will ever be received in respect of the PSC or that the pre-agreed fiscal terms will not be re-negotiated at a later date by the DRC government.
The Directors are confident that title will be confirmed.
Furthermore, the Group received a letter from the chairman of the Management Committee of the National Oil Company of Libya dated 28 February 2008 stating that the Block 7 licence area lies within the Libyan continental shelf and a portion of this area has already been licenced to Sirte Oil Company.
This letter also demands that the Group refrain from any activities over, or concerning, the Block 7 licence area and asserts the Libyan governments right to invoke Libyan and international law to protect its rights in the Block 7 licence area.
The Directors believe that the Libyan governments claims are unfounded.
