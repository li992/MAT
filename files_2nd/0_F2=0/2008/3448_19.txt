Section 4: Financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March 1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING Chloride Group PLC is a UK-listed electronics company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as the Company.
The Company is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union for its accounting period beginning on 1 April 2006.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses.
These estimates and associated assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time, and are used to make judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Changes to estimates and assumptions are reected in the financial statements in the period in which they are made.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND AREAS OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In applying the Companys accounting policies as set out in note 2, management has made accounting judgements in the determination of the carrying value of deferred tax assets, intangible assets, the quantication of provisions including retirement benefit obligations and the impairment of goodwill.
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes will differ from those assumptions and estimates.
An analysis of the key sources of estimation uncertainty is provided below.
DEFERREDTAX ASSETS The carrying value of certain deferred tax assets is dependent on sufficient taxable profits being generated in certain territories in future periods.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS To determine the net present value of certain customer relationships and trade names, management has estimated the additional future cash ows arising from these intangibles.
In the case of customer relationships, management has applied an estimated attrition factor to its forecast sales for the relevant unit and in the case of trade names has applied a notional royalty rate.
PROVISIONS The quantication of certain liabilities within provisions for environmental remediation obligations and for legal costs in relation to certain claims have been estimated.
Such liabilities depend on the actions of third parties and on the specic circumstances pertaining to each obligation, neither of which is controlled by the Company.
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS To determine whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value-in-use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS In assessing the Companys obligations relating to retirement benets, management made key assumptions relating to current and future mortality, expected returns on plan assets and discount rates.
PRESENTATION UNDER IFRS The statements are presented in pounds sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention.
The Company therefore complies with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulations, adjusted by the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities to fair value.
The nature of these adjustments are set out in the policies below.
During the period, the Company adopted the following accounting statements: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 54 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING CONTINUED At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards revisions to Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 2 Share-based Payments revised 2008 IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised 2008 IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations revised 2008 IFRS 8 Operating Segments IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements revised 2007 2008 IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment revised 2008 IAS 19 Employee Benets revised 2008 IAS 23 Borrowing Costs revised 2008 IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised 2008 IAS 28 Investments in Associates revised 2008 IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures revised 2008 IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation revised 2008 IAS 36 Impairment of Assets revised 2008 IAS 38 Intangible Assets revised 2008 IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement revised 2008 IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Dened benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards revisions to Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional segment disclosure when IFRS 8 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009 and the financial statement presentation changes under IAS 1 revised 2007 2008 which also comes into effect for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
These are the Companys third financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The Companys transition date for adoption of IFRS was 1 April 2005.
IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards allows companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS.
Accordingly, the Company took advantage of the following key exemptions on transition to IFRS: A BUSINESS COMBINATIONS: The Company chose not to restate to IFRS business combinations and the resultant acquisition goodwill for acquisitions made prior to the transition date.
B CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION DIFFERENCES: IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates requires that the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised directly in equity for foreign operations are transferred to the income statement as part of the profit or loss on any subsequent disposal.
As permitted by IFRS 1 the Company reset these cumulative foreign exchange translation differences to zero at the transition date.
C SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS: The Company applied IFRS 2 Share-based payments only to awards made after 7 November 2002 and which have not vested by 1 January 2005.
D FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The Company took the exemption not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 March each year.
Subsidiaries are those companies in which the Company has control, directly or indirectly, over the operations so as to obtain benets from those companies activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies have been eliminated.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 55 Section 4: Financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BUSINESS COMBINATIONS The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Company in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classied as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Companys interest in the net fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Companys interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
REVENUE RECOGNITION 1 REVENUE Revenue represents the amounts, excluding VAT and similar sales-related taxes, receivable by the Company for goods and services supplied to outside customers in the ordinary course of business.
Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists, products have been delivered or services have been rendered and collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenue on long-term contracts is recognised under the percentage to completion method of accounting and is calculated based on the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with the total expected costs for that contract.
Revenue from long-term service provision contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally determined by the proportion of the contract that has elapsed at the balance sheet date.
Revenue from services provided on a short-term or one-off basis is recognised when the service is complete.
2 INTEREST INCOME Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues by reference to the effective yield on the asset.
OPERATING PROFIT Operating profit is stated after restructuring costs but before investment income and finance cost.
INCOMETAX Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and is calculated using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that affects neither the taxable nor accounting profit is not recognised.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of the distribution of overseas retained earnings by subsidiaries to the extent that the subsidiary, at the balance sheet date, has entered into a binding agreement to do so.
56 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that there will be future taxable profits available to offset it and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES 1 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
2 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Income statements of foreign entities are translated to sterling at the average exchange rates for the year, approximating the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of shareholders equity to sterling at year-end exchange rates are taken to the translation reserve.
These differences are recognised as income or expense on disposal of the related subsidiary.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage operational exposures to foreign exchange and interest rate price risks.
These derivatives entered into by the Company consist mainly of currency forwards and interest rate swaps.
The Companys policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculation and therefore does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities and measured at their fair values at the date at which such contracts are entered into.
Subsequently derivative financial instruments are re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument in which case the timing of recognition in the profit and loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Hedge accounting is applied to derivative financial instruments that are effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or in cash ows of the hedged items.
Under hedge accounting of financial assets or liabilities changes in fair value of the financial derivative are recognised in the income statement where they are matched with changes in the fair value of the hedged item which are also recognised in the income statement.
Cash ow hedges are entered into where a derivative financial instrument is used to hedge the currency risks of anticipated future export sales, cash ow risks of anticipated future purchases and the cash ow risk from changes in interest rates.
The effective part of the changes in fair value of cash ow hedges are recognised in equity, while any ineffective part is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the rm commitment or forecasted transaction results in recognition of an asset or liability, the cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial measurement of that asset or liability.
Otherwise the cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction still is expected to occur, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments where their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
At the inception of a hedged relationship the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction together with its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Company also documents at inception and on an ongoing basis as to whether the derivatives used are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash ows of the hedged item.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 57 Section 4: Financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 1 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Most Company undertakings have pension or retirement benefit arrangements.
These vary but are appropriate to the legal requirements and local practices of the countries concerned.
Contributions to dened contribution plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For dened benefit plans, pension charges are determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the balance sheet date.
The amounts charged to the income statement consist of current service costs, interest costs, the expected returns on plan assets and past service costs.
Past service costs are recognised immediately where they have already vested and over the average period until they vest where they have not.
The Company has adopted the amendments to IAS 19 issued in December 2004.
Accordingly amounts recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense represent actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between actuarial assumptions used in previous valuations and the actual outcome and changes in actuarial assumptions.
Pension obligations recognised in the balance sheet represent the present value of dened benefit obligations adjusted for any past service costs not yet recognised and the fair value of any plan assets.
2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company operates share option programmes to allow employees to acquire shares in the Company at a price xed at the time of the award.
The Company also operates share award programmes which grant shares to certain employees.
These programmes are subject to both market related and non-market related vesting conditions.
For grants made after 7 November 2002 and remaining unvested at 1 January 2005 these awards are measured at their fair value at the date of grant.
This fair value is then charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reect expected and actual forfeiture during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
This fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
GOODWILL Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Companys share of the net identiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
This goodwill is carried in the balance sheet and is reviewed annually for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement and will not be subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is expressed in the currency of the subsidiary to which it relates and is translated to sterling using the year-end exchange rate.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the UK GAAP amounts.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit and loss on disposal.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 1 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the period in which it is incurred except where it relates to the development of a new or signicantly improved product or process that is technically and commercially feasible, where the Company has sufficient resources to complete the development and where the related costs can be reliably measured.
Expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
2 COMPUTER SOFTWARE Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment is recognised separately as an asset and is stated at cost less subsequent amortisation.
3 OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Other intangible assets, acquired by the Company, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
58 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED AMORTISATION Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
The rates generally used are: Computer software Three to seven years Other Two to ten years PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT With the exception of certain freehold properties, property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Assets under construction are not depreciated.
Certain of the Companys freehold properties were revalued in 1993.
These properties are held at this valuation deemed cost plus any subsequent capital expenditure and less cumulative depreciation.
Depreciation is charged on the straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets.
The rates generally in use are as follows: Freehold land Nil Freehold buildings 2% to 5% Leasehold buildings 2% to 5% or over remaining life of lease if shorter Plant, machinery and other equipment 5% to 33% Depreciation is calculated on the cost together with subsequent additions at cost.
Under UK GAAP, certain assets were revalued in 1993 and have been deemed at cost on transition to IFRS.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets.
Gains losses on disposal of an asset represent the difference between sales proceeds and the net carrying amount.
IMPAIRMENT Acquired goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
The carrying amounts of the Companys other assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment is recognised as a revaluation decrease.
1 CALCULATION OF THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNT The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and the value in use.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate independent cash inows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
2 REVERSAL OF IMPAIRMENT With the exception of acquisition goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is generally determined on a first-in first-out basis and in the case of products manufactured by the Group, consists of direct material and labour costs together with related factory overheads.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 59 Section 4: Financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED FINANCIAL ASSETS INVESTMENTS Investments other than those in associated companies and joint ventures are initially recognised at their fair value at the date of the transaction and are subsequently measured at each reporting date at their fair value.
The Companys investments comprise equity stakes in partnership enterprises.
These investments are classied as held for resale and the resultant gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of assets held for sale are directly recognised in equity until such assets are fide-recognised, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement if there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
TRADE RECEIVABLES Trade receivables are stated at their fair value by reference to invoiced amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts.
An allowance for doubtful accounts is recognised when it becomes likely that the originally invoiced amount is not fully realisable.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
TRADE PAYABLES Trade payables are stated at fair value.
BORROWING Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recognised initially at cost, less attributable transaction costs.
Borrowing costs including premiums payable on settlement are recognised in the income statement on the accruals basis.
EQUITY Equity is recorded in the balance sheet at the proceeds received less transaction costs.
LEASING Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classied as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, and are measured at the lower of fair value and the estimated present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Interest is charged to the income statement as a finance charge over the lease period.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and a reliable estimate of the amount of this obligation can be made.
1 WARRANTY Provision for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale to reect the likely costs of meeting such obligations.
2 RESTRUCTURING Provision for restructuring is recognised when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
3 ONEROUS CONTRACTS A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benets to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
60 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Assets are classied as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business.
Such assets must be available for immediate sale in their present condition, management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the asset which, when initiated, was expected to result in a completed sale within 12 months.
An extension of the period required to complete the sale does not preclude the asset from being classied as held for sale, provided the delay was for reasons beyond the Companys control and management remains committed to its plan to sell the asset.
Assets that are classied as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has either been disposed of, or satisfies the criteria to be classied as held for sale, and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to disposal.

Value in use calculations are used to calculate recoverable amount.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax free cash ows of the cash generating unit in which the goodwill is contained, applying a discount rate of the Company post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.68%.
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash ows.
These cash ow projections are made over a 20-year period and are consistent with approved budgets, and market growth rates projected by Frost & Sullivan over the first five years and a growth rate in line with an ination assumption of 2% per annum thereafter.

From 1 July DB Power has been accounted for as an associate and 20% of its net profit has been taken to profit for the period to 30 September, subsequently this percentage has increased to 32%.
JOINT VENTURE In October the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Phoenixtec Power Company to set up a manufacturing company in China.
Under the agreement the Company is obliged to make good its share of the start up losses, which at 31 March 2008 amounted to 126,000 and an appropriate accrual has therefore been made in the balance sheet for this amount.

The average consolidated term for trade debtors was 73 days 2007: 75 days.
Included in the Companys trade debtors are debtors with a carrying value of 14,094,000 2007: 11,061,000 which were past their due date at the reporting date, for which the Company has not provided.
As there has been no overall change in the underlying credit risk associated with these debts, the Company believes that these are recoverable.
The average term by which these debtors exceed their due date is 15 days 2007: 15 days.
Trade receivables are not normally interest bearing, although the Company may exercise the right to charge interest on overdue accounts.
Allowance for impairment is made where there is an identied loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ows.
Movement in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Balance at beginning of year 3,173 3,595 Exchange differences 505 64 Income statement charge 495 544 Acquisitions 58 Utilisation 441 902 Balance at end of year 3,790 3,173 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 71 Section 4: Financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March 17 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES CONTINUED CREDIT RISK The Companys principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments.
The Companys credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identied loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ows.
Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Company and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counter-parties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Company has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Company trades mainly with other companies with strong credit ratings and there is a good history of collection and cash generation with a limited history of impairment.

A 10% variation in the valuation of sterling at the balance sheet date would have an impact of 0.4 million 2007: 0.1 million.
All of this would be taken to the income statement.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that specified changes occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause uctuations in exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.

ANNUAL REPORT 2008 83 Section 4: Financial statements and notes NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Year ended 31 March 31 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS The Company has a number of pension or retirement benefit arrangements, which are established to meet local legal requirements and practices in the countries in which it operates.
These arrangements comprise both dened contribution and dened benefit schemes.
At 31 March 2008, the Company had a net deficit of 7.0 million 2007: 6.4 million in respect of its obligations under these arrangements.
The principal dened benefit schemes are operated in the UK and Germany, and in Italy the Company participates in the statutory Trattamento a Fine Rapporto TFR scheme.
The bases of these schemes are as follows: UK In the UK the Company operates a hybrid pension scheme with both dened benefit and dened contribution sections the Chloride 1996 Scheme.
At 31 March 2006 the dened contribution section of the scheme was separately identied within the scheme, with a separate investment pool.
The disclosures below for 2008 therefore represent only the dened benets element.
The dened benefit section of the Chloride 1996 Scheme has been closed to new members since 1 April 1998.
Funding is set after formal funding valuations carried out every three years by independent actuaries.
Following the last such valuation which was carried out as of 31 March 2005 the Company committed to make a special contribution of 3.5 million, of which 2.5 million was paid in 2007 2006: 1.0 million.
GERMANY In Germany the Company operates a dened benefit scheme which, in accordance with local practice, is unfunded.
Provision for future liabilities is made in the balance sheet in accordance with advice given by an independent actuary.
ITALY In Italy the Company participates in the statutory TFR scheme which, in accordance with local practice, was unfunded.
With effect from 1 January 2007 the administration of the scheme was changed so that entitlements for future service are funded and cease to be classied as dened benets.
Provision for past service, for which the employee has not elected to take payment, continue to be accounted for as a dened benefit obligation.
These changes have resulted in a curtailment credit in the year of 329,000 which has been taken to the income statement.
