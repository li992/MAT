24 Financial instruments Management of financial risks One of the principal responsibilities of Treasury is to manage the financial risks arising from the Groups underlying operations.
Specifically, Treasury manages, within an overall policy framework, the Groups exposure to funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty risks.
The Group defines capital as net debt see note 21 and equity see note 20.
The only externally imposed capital requirement for the Group is interest cover as described under interest rate risk below.
The Group assesses its financial capacity by reference to cash flow and interest cover.
Group policies include a set of financing principles, including the monitoring of credit ratings, interest cover and liquidity.
These provide a framework within which the Groups capital base is managed and, in particular, the policies on dividends as a percentage of long-term sustainable earnings and share buy-back are decided.
The Group manages its financial risks in line with the classification of its financial assets and liabilities in the Groups balance sheet and related notes.
The Groups management of specific risks is dealt with as follows: Liquidity risk It is the policy of the Group to maximise financial flexibility and minimise refinancing risk by issuing debt with a range of maturities, generally matching the projected cash flows of the Group and obtaining this financing from a wide range of providers.
The Group has a target average centrally managed debt maturity of 5 years with no more than 20 per cent of centrally managed debt maturing in a single year.
As at 31 December 2008, the average centrally managed debt maturity was 5.1 years 2007: 5.4 years and the highest proportion of centrally managed debt maturing in a single year was 18.3 per cent 2007: 16.7 per cent.
It is Group policy that short-term sources of funds including drawings under the US dollar commercial paper programme are backed by undrawn committed lines of credit and cash.

com annualreport2008 24 Financial instruments continued In the year ended 31 December 2008, the 1.8 billion revolving credit facility arranged in December 2007 was cancelled and replaced with the issue of 1.25 billion and 500 million bonds maturing in 2015 and 2024 respectively.
In addition to this, the Group increased its 1 billion 5.375 per cent, maturity 2017 bond by an additional 250 million, bringing the total size of the bond to 1.25 billion.
On 13 February 2008, the Group entered into an acquisition credit facility whereby lenders agreed to make available an amount of US$2 billion.
On 1 May 2008, this facility was syndicated in the market and was redenominated into 2 euro facilities, 1 of 420 million and 1 of 860 million.
These facilities expire on 31 October 2009.
There was a net draw down on these credit facilities of 1.15 billion during the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: nil.
During the year, the Group also issued US$300 million and US$700 million bonds, maturing in 2013 and 2018 respectively, pursuant to Rule 144A and RegS under the US Securities Act.
The Group also repaid US$330 million and 217 million bonds upon maturity in May and November respectively.
In addition, the Group repurchased its Mexican 2011 MXN1,055 million UDI bond and refinanced it with a floating rate borrowing of MXN1,444 million.
In 2007, 800 million of 1.7 billion bonds with a maturity of February 2009 were replaced by 1 billion bonds with a maturity of 2017.
In March 2007, the Groups central banking facility of 1.75 billion was extended on existing terms under a 1 year extension option with final maturity dates between March 2011 and March 2012, and was undrawn as at 31 December 2008.
The Group utilises cash pooling and zero balancing bank account structures in addition to inter-company loans and borrowings to ensure that there is the maximum mobilisation of cash within the Group.
The amount of debt issued by the Group is determined by forecasting the net debt requirement after the mobilisation of cash.
The Group continues to target investment-grade credit ratings: as at 31 December 2008, the ratings from Moodys and S&P were Baa1 BBB end 2007: Baa1 BBB.
The strength of the ratings has underpinned the debt issuance during 2007 and 2008 and, despite the impact of the turbulence in financial markets, the Group is confident of its ability to successfully access the debt capital markets, as demonstrated with the issue of US$1 billion bonds in the US bond market towards the end of 2008, following issues in the euro and sterling markets earlier in the year.
Subsidiary companies are funded by share capital and retained earnings, loans from the central finance companies on commercial terms, or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies.
All contractual borrowing covenants have been met and none are expected to inhibit the Groups operations or funding plans.
Currency risk The Group is subject to exposure on the translation of the net assets of foreign currency subsidiaries and associates into its reporting currency, sterling.
The Groups primary balance sheet translation exposures are to the US dollar, Canadian dollar, euro and South African rand.
These exposures are kept under continuous review.
The Groups policy on borrowings is to broadly match the currency of these borrowings with the currency of cash flows arising from the Groups underlying operations.
Within this overall policy, the Group aims to minimise all balance sheet translation exposure where it is practicable and cost effective to do so through matching currency assets with currency borrowings.
At 31 December 2008, the currency profile of the Groups gross debt, after taking into account derivative contracts, was 14 per cent 2007: 20 per cent US dollar, 55 per cent 2007: 53 per cent euro, 3 per cent 2007: 5 per cent Canadian dollar, 2 per cent 2007: nil per cent sterling, 7 per cent 2007: 12 per cent Australian dollar and 19 per cent 2007: 10 per cent other currencies.
Annual Report 2008 British American Tobacco 151 Directors report and accounts Notes on the accounts continued 24 Financial instruments continued The Group faces currency exposures arising from the translation of profits earned in foreign currency subsidiaries and associates: these exposures are not normally hedged.
Exposures also arise from: i foreign currency denominated trading transactions undertaken by subsidiaries.
These exposures comprise committed and highly probable forecast sales and purchases, which are offset wherever possible.
The remaining exposures are hedged within the Treasury policies and procedures with forward foreign exchange contracts and options, which are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk of the identified future transactions: and ii forecast dividend flows from subsidiaries to the centre.
To ensure cash flow certainty, the Group hedges such flows using forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges of the foreign exchange risk arising from the investments in these subsidiaries.
IFRS7 requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the income statement and on items recognised directly in equity of hypothetical changes of exchange rates in respect of non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities held across the Group.
All other variables are held constant although, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
All financial assets and liabilities held in the functional currency of the Groups subsidiaries, as well as non-financial assets and liabilities and translation risk, are not included in the analyses.
The Group considers a 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency against the non-functional currency of its subsidiaries as a reasonably possible change.
The impact is calculated with reference to the financial asset or liability held as at the year end, unless this is unrepresentative of the position during the year.
A 10 per cent strengthening of functional currencies against non-functional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being 187 million higher 2007: 21 million higher and items recognised directly in equity being 427 million higher 2007: 211 million higher.
A 10 per cent weakening of functional currencies against non-functional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being 216 million lower 2007: 21 million lower and items recognised directly in equity being 519 million lower 2007: 243 million lower.
The exchange sensitivities on items recognised directly in equity relates to hedging of certain net asset currency positions in the Group, but does not include sensitivities in respect of exchange on non-financial assets, as well as on cash flow hedges in respect of future transactions debt.
Interest rate risk The objectives of the Groups interest rate risk management policy are to lessen the impact of adverse interest rate movements on the earnings, cash flow and economic value of the Group, and to safeguard against any possible breach of its financial covenants.
Additional objectives are to minimise the cost of hedging and the associated counterparty risk.
The Group targets gross interest cover to be between 5 times and 9 times and for 2008 it is 8.5 times 2007: 9.4 times.
The only externally imposed capital requirement the Group has is in respect of its centrally managed banking facilities, which require a gross interest cover of 4.5 times.
In order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt.
The Group sets targets within overall guidelines for the desired ratio of floating to fixed rate debt on both a gross 50:50 10 and net at least 50 per cent fixed in the short to the medium term basis as a result of regular reviews of market conditions and strategy by Treasury and the board of the main central finance company.
At 31 December 2008, the relevant ratios of floating to fixed rate borrowings were 45:55 2007: 53:47 on a gross basis and 25:75 2007: 33:67 on a net basis.
Underlying borrowings are arranged on both a fixed rate and a floating rate basis and, where appropriate, the Group uses derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, to vary the fixed and floating mix.
The interest rate profile of liquid assets is taken into account in determining the net interest rate exposure.

For the purposes of these sensitivity analyses, financial assets and liabilities with fixed interest rates are not included.
The Group considers a 100 basis point change in interest rates a reasonably possible change.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in pre-tax profit being 52 million lower 2007: 28 million lower and items recognised directly in equity being 1 million higher 2007: 1 million higher.
A 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in pre-tax profit being 52 million higher 2007: 28 million higher and items recognised directly in equity being 1 million lower 2007: 1 million lower.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
Subsidiaries have policies in place requiring appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
The process for monitoring and managing credit risk once sales to customers have been made varies depending on local practice in the countries concerned.
Certain territories have bank guarantees, other guarantees and credit insurance provided in the Groups favour in respect of Group trade receivables, the issuance and terms of which are dependent on local practices in the countries concerned.
Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from the related counterparties.
Generally the Group targets a long-term counterparty credit rating of at least A A2, however, the Group recognises that due to the need to operate over a large geographic footprint, sovereign risk can be the determining factor on the suitability of a counterparty.
From time to time the Group may invest in short dated corporate commercial paper, for this the Group has identified specific counterparties with a minimum short-term rating of A1 P1.
Counterparty credit risk is managed on a global basis by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any 1 counterparty, taking into account its credit rating.
The credit ratings of all counterparties are reviewed regularly.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient counterparty credit capacity of requisite quality to undertake all anticipated transactions throughout its geographic footprint while at the same time ensuring that there is no geographic concentration in the location of counterparties.
The maximum exposure to the credit risk of financial assets at the balance sheet date is reflected by the carrying values included in the Groups balance sheet.
In addition, the Group has issued guarantees to third parties, part of which has been recognised on the balance sheet in accordance with IAS39.
The unrecognised portion of these guarantees amounts to 66 million 2007: 61 million.
Price risk The Group is exposed to equity price risk on equity investments held by the Group, which are included in available-for-sale investments on the consolidated balance sheet, but the quantum of such is not material.
