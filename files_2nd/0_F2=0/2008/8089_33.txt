Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates for the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and long-term growth in gross domestic product.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following 5 years based on an estimated zero growth rate for the Performance Improvement business and a growth rate of 3 per cent for all other businesses and a further 20 years based on estimated long-term growth in gross domestic product of 1.75 per cent for all businesses.
The rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rates used to discount the cash flows were 6.9 per cent 2007: 7 per cent for Scientific, Technical & Medical, 9.9 per cent 2007: 10 per cent for Performance Improvement and 7.9 per cent 2007: 8 per cent for all other CGUs.
