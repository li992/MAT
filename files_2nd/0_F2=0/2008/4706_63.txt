22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price movements that arise in the normal course of the groups business.
The groups treasury objectives, risk management strategies and policies are disclosed in the Business review see Risk management.
i Currency risk The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements, which will affect the groups transaction costs and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign operations by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps and forwards.
In February 2008, the board reviewed and approved the following revised foreign exchange risk management policy to effectively manage planning and rebalancing processes.
Where a liquid foreign exchange market exists, the groups policy is to seek to hedge currency exposure on its net investment in foreign operations within the following percentage bands: 80% to 100% for US dollars, 80% to 100% for euros and 50% to 100% for other significant currencies.
The groups previous policy was, where a liquid foreign exchange market exists, to seek to hedge currency exposure on its foreign equity investments before net borrowings at approximately the following percentages: 90% for US dollars, 90% for euros and 50% for other significant currencies.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings including foreign currency swaps and forwards, to the extent that they are in an effective hedge relationship, are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to match exchange differences on foreign equity investments.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not in a hedge relationship and any ineffectiveness are taken to the income statement.

For currencies in which there is an active market, the group seeks to hedge between 60% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with coverage levels increasing nearer to the forecast transaction date.
The groups previous policy for currencies in which there is an active market, was to seek to hedge between 80% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement.
Hedge of foreign currency debt The group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with certain foreign currency denominated bonds.
At 30 June 2008, as a result of the net investment, transaction exposure and foreign currency debt cover outlined above, the group had outstanding gross foreign exchange contracts as disclosed in note 22 vi.
Further quantitative analysis of the sensitivity to movements in currency rates is reported in the Market risk sensitivity analysis in the Business review ii Commodity price risk The group uses long term purchase and commodity futures contracts to hedge against price risk in certain commodities.
Long term purchase contracts are used to secure prices with suppliers to protect against volatility in commodity prices.
All commodity futures contracts hedge a projected future purchase of raw material.
Commodity futures are then either closed out at the time the raw material is purchased or they are exchanged with the company manufacturing the raw material to determine the contract price.
Commodity futures contracts are held in the balance sheet at fair value.
To the extent that they are considered an effective hedge, the fair value movements are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Realised net gains recognised in the income statement in the year ended 30 June 2008 were 4 million 2007 2 million.
There were no unrealised net gains on the balance sheet at 30 June 2008 2007 1 million as all commodity futures contracts had expired before that date.
iii Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally on changes in US dollar, euro and sterling interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to floating rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily through issuing fixed and floating rate term debt and commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate derivatives.
These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the groups reported financial performance.
In June 2007, the board reviewed the groups interest rate risk management policy and approved the following revised policy, which allows for flexibility in executing the policy to facilitate operational efficiency and effective hedge accounting.
The new policy was implemented during the year ended 30 June 2008.
Fixed rate borrowings are maintained within a band of 40% to 60% of projected net borrowings for a time period approved by the board, and the overall net borrowings portfolio is managed according to a duration measure.

Amounts are shown on an undiscounted basis.
Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of the years ended 30 June 2008 and 30 June 2007 until maturity of the investments.
The group had available undrawn committed bank facilities as follows: 2008 2007 million million Expiring within one year 503 498 Expiring between one and two years 452 Expiring after two years 668 1,109 1,623 1,607 Commitment fees are paid on the undrawn portion of these facilities and accounted for on an accruals basis.
Borrowings under these facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates dependent on the period of drawdown plus an agreed margin.
These facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together with cash and cash equivalents, support the groups commercial paper programmes.
There are no financial covenants on the above short and long term borrowings.
Certain of these borrowings contain cross default provisions and negative pledges and related sale and lease back provisions.
The committed bank facilities are subject to a single financial covenant, being minimum interest cover ratio of two times defined as the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items, aggregated with share of associates profits, to net interest.
They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageos financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain notes and the inability to access committed facilities.
Diageo was in full compliance with its financial covenants throughout each of the periods presented.

b Derivative financial instruments not designated in hedging relationships.
All derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as derivatives at fair value through the income statement.
The group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
The fair values of quoted borrowings are based on the asking price.
The fair values of other borrowings, derivatives, financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated using appropriate yield curves at 30 June each year by discounting the future contractual cash flows to the net present values.
133 212833 DIAGEO REPORT P128-145 5 9 08 10:14 Page 134 DIAGEO | ANNUAL REPORT 2008 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT continued Fair value hedging relationships Certain borrowings due within and after one year are part of qualifying fair value interest rate hedging relationships.
Accordingly there is a fair value adjustment for these liabilities with respect to the hedged interest rate risk, with changes being recognised in the income statement, as disclosed in note 22 vi.
Diageo has not designated any non-derivative financial assets or liabilities at fair value through the income statement upon initial recognition.
vi Hedging instruments Diageo designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either: a a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability fair value hedge : b a hedge of a forecast transaction or the cash flow risk from a change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates cash flow hedge : or c a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations.
The accounting treatment for hedges is disclosed in Accounting policies of the group.
Diageo tests effectiveness on a prospective and retrospective basis.
Methods for testing effectiveness include dollar offset, critical terms, regression analysis, hypothetical derivative method and volatility reduction.
All fair value hedges were effective during the year.
The gain on hedging instruments for the year was 47 million 2007 20 million gain and the loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks was 47 million 2007 17 million loss, resulting in a net loss of 54 million 2007 25 million net loss recognised in interest expense and finance charges and a net gain of 54 million 2007 28 million net gain recognised in interest income and finance income for the year.
For the year ended 30 June 2008, all cash flow hedges were effective and gains of 26 million 2007 28 million gains have been recognised in equity as the changes in fair value.
A gain of 63 million and a gain of 6 million have been transferred out of equity to other operating income and to other finance income, respectively, in the year 2007 43 million loss to other operating expenses and 8 million gain to other finance income, respectively.
With respect to hedges of forecast transactions and the cash flow risk from a change in interest rates, balances related to cash flow hedged items at 30 June 2008 will affect the income statement in 2009 and 2010 by 5 million and 10 million, respectively.
With respect to hedges of the cash flow risk from a change in forward foreign exchange rates using cross currency interest rate swaps, the retranslation of the related bond principal to closing foreign exchange rates and recognition of interest on the related bonds will affect the income statement at each period end date until the related bonds mature in 2016 and 2036.
Foreign exchange retranslation and the interest on the hedged bonds taken to the income statement is expected to offset against the foreign exchange retranslation and the interest on the cross currency swaps in each of the years.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less at acquisition including money market deposits, commercial paper and investments.
At 30 June 2008, approximately 38% and 22% of the groups cash and cash equivalents of 714 million were invested with counterparties based in the United Kingdom and United States, respectively.
At 30 June 2008, approximately 17% of the groups trade receivables of 1,700 million were due from counterparties based in the United Kingdom and approximately 18% were due from counterparties based in the United States.
