Notes to the Group Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2008 1.
Reporting entity Genus plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is Belvedere House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4HG.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Business Overview.
The Group financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2008 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the equity method is used to account for the Groups interests in joint ventures and associates.
Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The significant accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements and in restating the opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2005 for the purposes of the transition to IFRS which is available on the Group website at www.
Certain comparative amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current years presentation.
In addition, the comparative income statement has been re-presented as if an operation discontinued during the current period had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period see note 6.
Functional and presentation currency The Group financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
All financial information presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest million at one decimal point.
Basis of measurement The Group financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the following, in accordance with IFRS: biological assets are measured at fair value less point-of-sale costs, which represent the costs of distribution and selling expenses: derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value: and disposal groups and non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at fair value less costs to sell.
The methods used to measure fair values are described further in note 4.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in note 4.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The results of subsidiaries acquired are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The results of subsidiaries sold cease to be consolidated from the date on which control passed.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The Group financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The Group financial statements include the Groups share of profit or loss arising from joint ventures.
Treatment of discontinued operations is as described in the accounting policy for non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the Group financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Adjusted operating profit from continuing operations Adjusted operating profit from continuing operations is defined as operating profit from continuing operations before the fair value movement in biological assets, amortisation of intangible assets, share based payments expense and exceptional items.
This additional non-GAAP measure of operating performance is included as the Directors believe that it provides a useful alternative measure for shareholders of the trading performance of the Group since it presents operating profit from continuing operations before the non cash fair value movement in biological assets, non cash amortisation of intangibles, non cash share based payment expense and exceptional items.
The reconciliations between operating profit from continuing operations and adjusted operating profit from continuing operations are shown on the face of the income statement.
The Directors recognise this alternative measure has limitations.
46 I Annual Report 2008 Group Financials Business Review Introduction Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 02 - 05 Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency of the relevant Group entity at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and the related foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the translation into sterling of foreign operations, and the fair value movement of related effective hedges, are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal of the foreign operation.
The Group has elected to reset the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to zero at the date of transition to IFRS 1 April 2005.
Exchange movements on intercompany loans designated as long term funding are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve, 06 - 23 together with any related taxation.
The principal exchange rates were as follows: Average Closing 2008 2007 2008 2007 US Dollar 2.01 1.94 1.99 2.01 Euro 1.36 1.48 1.26 1.49 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations A non-current asset or a group of assets containing a non-current asset a disposal group is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale, the sale is highly probable within one year and management is committed to the sale.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to income statement.
The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent re-measurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of or that meets the criteria to 24 - 40 be classified as held for sale.
Discontinued operations are presented in the income statement including the comparative period analysing the post tax profit or loss of the discontinued operation and the post tax gain or loss, and are recognised on either the re-measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on disposal of the assets disposal groups constituting discontinued operations.
Significant accounting policies Business combinations Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS 1 in respect of acquisitions prior to 1 April 2005, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
The cost of acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair value at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities which meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill Goodwill arising since 1 April 2005 on the acquisition of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture represents the excess of the cost of 41 - 104 acquisition over the Groups interests in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Identifiable assets include any intangible assets which could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 April 2005, goodwill is recorded at deemed cost, which represents the net amount recorded under UK GAAP at 1 April 2005.
On transition, amortisation of goodwill has ceased.
As required by IAS 21, goodwill arising on acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments made to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the acquired operation on acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the acquired entity rather than assets or liabilities of the acquiring entity, and are therefore expressed in the functional currency of the foreign operation and retranslated at the balance sheet date.
Annual Report 2008 I 47 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued for the year ended 30 June 2008 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The Groups development activities comprise the development and maintenance of the porcine genetic nucleus herd and the development and maintenance of bovine pre-stud herds.
The Group does not capitalise development expenditure separately for these herds as their fair value is included within the fair value of the Groups biological assets in accordance with IAS 41.
The Group discloses the aggregate costs incurred in research and herd development activities as required by IAS 38.
Exceptional items The Group presents items which the Directors believe to be exceptional in nature by virtue of their size or incidence as exceptional.
Examples in 2008 are the costs incurred due to the earthquake in China and the cost of the main market listing.
Intangible assets Under the transition election, the Group has not restated business combinations prior to the transition date of 1 April 2005.
Intangible assets acquired by the Group in a business combination subsequent to 1 April 2005 are identified and recognised separately from goodwill where they satisfy the definition of an intangible asset and their fair values can be measured reliably.
The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Software 2 to 10 years Porcine genetics technology 20 years Multiplier contracts 5 years Customer relationships 17 years Intangible assets acquired separately Intangible assets acquired other than through a business combination are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups tangible and intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate of 9.2%, the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
As the Group comprises two large well diversified businesses the Directors believe that this approach reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
A cashgenerating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Reversals of impairment An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
48 I Annual Report 2008 Group Financials Business Review Introduction Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 02 - 05 Biological assets and inventories The principal activity of the Group during the period was the global application of quantitative genetics and biotechnology to animal breeding in the bovine and porcine sectors.
The Group utilises these techniques to identify and select animals that possess the genetics genes responsible for superior milk and meat quality, high health and performance traits.
Genus sells breeding animals and semen to customers who produce offspring which yield greater production efficiency, milk and meat quality for the global dairy and meat supply chain.
The bovine business model uses research and development to identify genetically superior bulls in a number of breeds, but primarily the Holstein dairy breed.
Progeny testing of the performance of daughters for each bull selected measures their performance against those of their peers.
Semen from the best bulls is collected and frozen to satisfy customer demand.
Semen from dairy breeds is used by farmers to breed replacement milking stock.
Semen sold from beef breeds is used in either specialist beef breeding herds for multiplication of breeding bulls for use in natural service or on dairy cows to produce a by-product to be reared for meat.
The porcine business maintains breeding stock which it develops and improves to be genetically superior.
The offspring or semen obtained from these animals is sold to customers for use in commercial farming.
The animal genetics offer the potential to improve profitability for farmer and food processing customers by enabling them to increase output of consistently high quality products yielding higher value.
To allow the Group to capitalise on its intellectual property it almost entirely out-sources production to its global multiplier network.
06 - 23 The breeding animal and semen biological assets are recognised and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement within operating profit for the period.
Since the sexing of semen is not a biological process but a production process, semen inventory transferred into production is transferred at fair value at point of harvest less cost to sell and becomes a component of the production process.
Sexed semen is carried in finished goods at production cost.
Bovine biological assets are held for long term internal use and are classified as non-current assets.
Bull semen is transferred to inventory at fair value at point of harvest, which becomes the deemed cost under IAS 2.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Porcine biological assets which are in use as breeding animals are classified as non-current assets.
Porcine biological assets held with an intention of resale, being the offspring of the breeding herd, are carried at fair value and classified as current assets.
Determination of fair values biological assets Bovine The fair value of proven bulls and bulls on test, proven bulls being those where the bulls semen is actively marketed, is based on expected net cash flows from the sale of semen discounted at a current market-determined pre-tax rate.
The significant assumptions determining the fair values are the expected future demand for semen, estimated production value, the expected marketable life of each bull and, in addition for bulls on test, the percentage whose production is expected to be actively marketed.
In assessing the sales price, management uses statistical data for the bulls produced by independent authorities, in all its major markets, three times a year.
In addition, estimates are also used to determine into which markets the semen will be sold, and domestic and 24 - 40 export prices.
Porcine The fair values of porcine biological assets are calculated using average live weights of the animals plus a premium if considered that they will be saleable for their favourable genetic characteristics.
The value attributed to the live weight of the pigs and the premium for genetics is based on recent transaction prices achieved by the Group.
The significant assumptions determining fair values are the expected life of the breeding animals, the percentage of production animals which are expected to be saleable as breeding animals and the expected sales prices.
Recognition of third parties interest in the Groups biological assets, and recognition of the Groups interest in biological assets managed by third parties The fair value of the bovine herd and semen inventory managed by the Group has been adjusted where a third party has a revenue share in the sale of semen from a particular bull.
The fair value of the porcine herd includes pigs owned and managed by third parties where a substantial interest in the form of genetic premium has been retained by the Group.
The fair values of these animals reflect only the interest of the Group.
Non recognition of porcine multiplier contracts where no contractual interest is retained by the Group In order to manage commercial risk the Groups porcine business model also involves the sale of pigs at market price to farmers multipliers who produce piglets on farms neither managed nor controlled by the Group.
The Group has the option to purchase the offspring at slaughter market value plus a small premium but no obligation to do so.
The Group then has the ability to sell the offspring to other farmers at a premium because the offspring has superior genetics.
41 - 104 Since the pigs are sold to the multipliers in the first instance at market price and there is no obligation on the Group to repurchase the offspring, the Group does not record any biological asset in respect of the offspring until purchased.
The option to purchase offspring is not valued on the balance sheet as the contracts are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt of non-financial items the offspring in accordance with the Groups expected purchase requirements.
As such they are outside the scope of IAS 39.
Annual Report 2008 I 49 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued for the year ended 30 June 2008 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Porcine royalty arrangements Pigs sold on a royalty basis are deemed not to be the sale of an entire pig.
The amount valued on the balance sheet is based on the percentage interest retained.
The fair value of the retained interest is reassessed every quarter and reduced on a straight-line basis over 24 months the estimated life of an animal.
The fair value of the retained interest is classified as a current asset for any value that will be taken within the following 12 months and as non-current for values covering the remaining 12 months.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, together with any directly attributable expenses of acquisition, or at their latest valuation, less depreciation and any impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Land and assets not available for use are not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold land Nil Freehold buildings 10 to 15 years Leasehold buildings over the term of the lease Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount discounted if material less impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are discounted to present value.
Revenue Revenue comprises the invoiced value of sales and royalties receivable from customers, net of trade discounts and value added tax.
The principal components of the Groups revenue and their respective accounting treatments are: Revenue from the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals and veterinary products is recognised upon transfer of risks and rewards, either upon shipment to customers or delivery depending on the terms of sale.
Royalties are recognised when receivable.
Royalty payments are received from certain porcine customers based on key performance variables such as the number of pigs born per litter, the number of litters born per sow and the average slaughter weight of animal born.
Long term contracts in the business are reviewed individually on a consistent basis to assess costs to completion and enable the assessment of the outcome of the contract.
Revenue and profit are recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the contracts outcome can be foreseen with reasonable certainty.
Provision is made for the full amount of any foreseeable losses on contracts.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised directly in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance costs Interest income and interest payable are recognised in the income statement as they accrue.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entitys right to receive payments is established.
50 I Annual Report 2008 Group Financials Business Review Introduction Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 02 - 05 Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity, or arises as a fair value adjustment in a business combination.
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or to be recovered using the tax rates and the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes where the underlying transactions or events result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is 06 - 23 probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Share based payments In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of share awards and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period of each option.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a Binomial valuation model.
The fair value of the awards granted is measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the estimated performance against non market related conditions and the number of share awards and options that actually vest at the end of the vesting period.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements as set out in IFRS 1, the recognition and measurement criteria for share based payments have been applied retrospectively for equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 and unvested at the applicable date.
No adjustments have been made for equity instruments granted prior to this date.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to construction of a qualifying asset, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Treasury shares Transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group-sponsored Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company remain deducted from shareholders funds 24 - 40 until they vest unconditionally with employees.
Retirement benefit obligations Defined contribution pension schemes A number of employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
Differences between contributions payable and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes for some of its employees.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit schemes is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price is deducted.
The liability discount rate is the market yield at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the Groups pension liabilities.
The calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the projected unit market method.
Actuarial gains and losses including the difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets and experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities are recognised in the period in which they occur directly into equity through the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
Pension costs are recognised on a systematic basis to match the costs of providing retirement benefits evenly over the service lives of 41 - 104 the employees concerned.
Any excess or deficiency of the actuarial value of assets over the actuarial value of liabilities is allocated over the average remaining service lives of current employees.
On transition to IFRS all actuarial gains and losses as at 1 April 2005 were recognised in reserves.
Actuarial gains and losses arising subsequent to 1 April 2005 are recognised in the period in which they occur directly into equity through the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
For one of the defined benefits schemes the Group operates, the Milk Pension Fund, the Group takes a multi-employer exemption and only accounts for its sectionalised assets and liabilities.
Although managed on a sectionalised basis the Group, together with the other participating employers, is joint and severally liable for the schemes obligations.
These obligations are disclosed as a contingent liability.
Annual Report 2008 I 51 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued for the year ended 30 June 2008 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts implemented through a medium term US Dollar cross currency borrowing and related interest rate swap to hedge exposure to translation risk associated with US Dollar net assets of subsidiary entities.
The Group also uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk.
The use of financial derivative instruments is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
The fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in equity in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Where a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are recycled in the Group Income Statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the Group Income Statement, i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Net investment hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability of the net assets of an overseas subsidiary entity arising from the spot exchange rate translation risk associated with the functional currency of overseas subsidiary entities, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until such point as the investment to which it relates is disposed.
Net investment hedge accounting is applied solely in the Group financial statements.
Foreign exchange borrowings are used to hedge net assets of an overseas subsidiary entity.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 30 June 2008, but the principles have been applied by the Group in interpreting existing standards: IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 30 June 2008, and have not been applied in preparing these Group financial statements: IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires the identification of operating segments based on internal reporting to the chief operating decision makers and extends the scope and disclosure requirements of IAS 14 Segmental Reporting.
IFRS 8 will become mandatory for the Groups 2010 financial statements and the Group is assessing the impact of the standard on its segmental analysis disclosure.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangement, and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes will become mandatory for the Groups 2009 financial statements.
The adoption of these IFRICs is not expected to have any material impact on the Group financial statements.
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate and IFRIC 16 Hedges of Net Investment in a Foreign Operation will become mandatory for the Groups 2010 financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 1, IAS 23, IAS 27, IAS 32, IAS 39, IFRS 2, IFRS 3, and the omnibus of other minor improvements, effective for the year ended 30 June 2010.
The Group is assessing the impact of these amendments.
Significant areas of judgement and determination of fair values Management consider the critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement to be following: Determination of the fair value of biological assets and agricultural produce The determination of the fair values of bovine and porcine biological assets and agricultural produce requires the use of significant judgement and assumptions including an estimation of the use of future cash flows, use of appropriate discount rate in order to calculate present value, forecast sales volumes, prices and the lives of animals.
52 I Annual Report 2008 Group Financials Business Review Introduction Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 02 - 05 Fair value of assets and liabilities on business combinations The Groups accounting policy on the acquisition of subsidiaries is to determine the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired with the fair value of any consideration in excess of this amount representing goodwill.
In determining the fair values of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the use of significant judgement and assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows and unprovided liabilities and commitments, particularly to tax, are often involved.
The determination of the useful life of intangible assets, particularly on those arising on acquisition, involves the exercise of management judgment.
Impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets Determining whether goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cashgenerating units to which goodwill, intangible and tangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the Directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and the appropriate discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Assets held for sale Assets held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to the income statement.
The proceeds of disposal of these assets may result in a profit or loss on disposal that will be included in the 06 - 23 following years accounts, that is different to the Directors estimated amounts.
Recognition of deferred tax assets In recognising income tax assets and liabilities, the Directors make estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain.
In recognising deferred tax assets and liabilities management also makes judgements about likely future taxable profits.
When the final outcome of such matters, including the recognition of deferred tax assets on tax losses is different, or expected to be different, from previous assessments by management, a change to the carrying value of income tax assets and liabilities will be recorded in the period in which such a determination is made.
Defined benefit pension scheme Amounts recorded in the financial statements in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are also based on significant estimates and judgement.

The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each unit are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Porcine 46.8 44.6 Bovine 16.2 16.1 Animal Health 5.8 Development Consulting 0.1 63.0 66.6 Less transferred to assets held for sale 5.9 63.0 60.7 66 I Annual Report 2008 Group Financials Business Review Introduction Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 02 - 05 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations of both cash-generating units are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices, and direct costs during the period.
Management have estimated the discount rate using the weighted average cost of capital of the business, changes in selling prices and direct costs, which are based on past experience and expectations of future change in the market.
The Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows using estimated growth rates beyond the budgeting period.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are: A growth rate of 3.0% has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.
This growth rate does not exceed the anticipated average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
A post-tax discount rate of 9.2% has been applied to cash flow projections, which equates to a pre-tax rate of approximately 13.1%.

The Group limits these risks by outsourcing porcine production, maintaining porcine genetic nucleus farms and bovine stud farms in different locations and ensuring high veterinary standards.
The key drivers in the movement in the bovine biological asset value are forecast sales volumes, sales prices, expected marketable lives of bulls, production volumes and the change in proportion of owned bulls to leased bulls.
The key drivers in the movement in the porcine biological asset value are the number of pigs on owned farms, number of pigs despatched on a royalty basis, number of pigs on owned farms that will achieve a genetic premium, prices achieved for premium genetics and changes between own and outsourced production.

The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 62 days 2007: 54 days.
No interest is charged on the receivables for the first 30 days from the date of the invoice.
The Group provides for all receivables based upon knowledge of the customer and historical experience and estimates irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference to past default experience.

Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 14.4m 2007: 11.8m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected liquidation proceeds.
Receivables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency comprise 14.2m of receivables denominated in US Dollar 2007: 12.0m and 8.5m of receivables denominated in Euros 2007: 5.4m.

Financial instruments Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 29, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 33.
Gearing ratio The Groups Board of Directors reviews the capital structure on an annual basis.
As part of this review, they consider the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Debt 96.8 138.4 Cash and cash equivalents 19.3 27.3 Net Debt 77.5 111.1 Equity 185.1 150.9 Net debt to equity ratio 42% 74% Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 29.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the parent.
Externally imposed capital requirement The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements.

These risks include market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board of Directors regularly.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Corporate Treasury function reports quarterly to the Board of Directors that monitors risks and policies implemented to mitigate risk exposures.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: 06 - 23 forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of goods in foreign currency and on the purchase of supplies in foreign currencies: interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates: and cross currency swap contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations, which has the US Dollar as its functional currency.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m US Dollar including leases 34.5 2.6 3.7 3.8 Australian Dollar 6.3 5.1 24 - 40 41 - 104 Annual Report 2008 I 77 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued for the year ended 30 June 2008 28.
Financial instruments continued Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to movement in the US Dollar and the Euro exchange rates.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 5% - 15% increase and decrease in the sterling against the relevant foreign currencies.
5% - 15% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 5% - 15% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower.
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the sterling strengthens against the relevant currency.
For a weakening of the sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.

78 I Annual Report 2008 Group Financials Business Review Introduction Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 02 - 05 Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap agreements.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, thereby ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 0.5% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 30 June 2008 would decrease increase by nil million 2007: decrease increase by 0.1m.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups high level of 06 - 23 fixed rate borrowing and cash all at variable rates.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Cash flow hedges Interest rate swaps Outstanding receive Average floating pay fixed contracts fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % m m m m GBP IRS 2 to 5 years 4.74 4.74 55.0 115.0 1.1 3.4 24 - 40 USD IRS 2 to 5 years 3.20 N A 30.1 N A 0.4 N A 85.1 115.0 1.5 3.4 The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 3 month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.

Financial instruments continued Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure on financial instruments is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board annually.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group has a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes covering many of its employees.
The principal funds are those in the United Kingdom, the Milk Pension Fund and the Dalgety Pension Fund, which are defined benefit schemes.
The assets of these funds are held separately from the assets of the Group and administered by trustees and managed professionally.
These schemes are closed to new members.
The financial position of the defined benefit schemes as recorded in accordance with IAS 19 are aggregated for disclosure purposes.
The liability split by principle scheme is set out below.
2008 2007 m m The Milk Pension Fund Genus section 14.2 7.2 The Dalgety Pension Fund 1.4 Other retirement benefit obligations 6.9 7.3 Gross liability 21.1 15.9 Deferred taxation 5.9 4.8 Net liability 15.2 11.1 Overall, the Group expects to pay 1.5m in contributions to defined benefit plans in the 2008 9 financial year.
The Milk Pension Fund MPF The Milk Pension Fund is that previously operated by the Milk Marketing Board, and was also open to membership of staff working for Milk Marque Ltd the principal employer now known as Community Foods Group Limited, National Milk Records plc, First Milk Ltd, Dairy Farmers of Britain Ltd, Milk Link Ltd, the Milk Development Council and hauliers associated to First Milk Ltd, Dairy Farmers of Britain Ltd and Milk Link Ltd.
It is managed on a sectionalised basis but ultimate liabilities are joint and several.
Genus only accounts for its section but discloses details regarding the full potential contingent liability below.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Milk Pension Fund was at 31 March 2006.
The valuation of the fund used the projected unit method for future service, a control period of 3 years was used and was carried out by professionally qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted for the funding valuation as at 31 March 2006, with each being expressed as the excess over the assumption for the annual rate of inflation, were as follows.
For the annual rate of return on the investments for discounting liabilities pre-retirement: 4%, and for discounting liabilities post-retirement: 2.05%.
For the annual increase in the present and future pensions in payment: nil%, for the annual rate of increase in pensionable earnings for past service liabilities: 1%, and for the annual rate of increase in pensionable earnings for future service liabilities: 1%.
At the date of the valuation, the market value of the funds assets amounted to 313 million, of which Genus plcs notional share is 110m.
The actuarial value of the assets of the whole fund was sufficient to cover 98 percent of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for assumed increases in earnings.
The deficit in the fund as a whole, disclosed by the 31 March 2006 valuation, is 6.8 million of which Genus plcs notional share is 1.9m and this shortfall is being addressed by additional contributions from the participating employers.
82 I Annual Report 2008 Group Financials Business Review Introduction Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 02 - 05 With effect from 1 May 2007, the Group amended the benefit and member contribution structure for future service, which has had the effect of reducing Group contributions in respect of future service accrual.
This is reflected in the current valuation of the IAS 19 liabilities.
As a result, the contribution rate of the Group in respect of pension payments from 1 May 2007 has been agreed with the Milk Pension Fund at 10.1% of members pensionable earnings.
In addition a contribution of 0.3m per annum will be paid in respect of the past service deficit and a further contribution of 0.3m per annum will be paid towards expenses.
Based on the actuarial assumptions, and allowing for the amortisation of the deficit over the average remaining service of current employees, the actuary has calculated that the Groups pension cost for the scheme is 0.7m.
Dalgety Pension Fund A Deed of Agreement was signed on 23 January 2008 by the Company and the trustees of the fund which formed the basis of the funding arrangement agreed for the actuarial valuation of the fund as of 31 March 2006.
Under the agreement the Company agreed to make deficit repair contributions of 2.4m to the fund of which 1.8m were made by 31 December 2007 with a further 0.6m in January 2008.
The trustees of the fund agreed to transfer an amount of 4.8m into the fund from their trustee share of surplus.
2.1m of this amount was in respect of known liabilities with an additional 2.7m transferred as a reserve against future unknown liabilities materialising.
As the economic benefit to the Company of this latter amount is not certain, it is treated as a contingent asset.
06 - 23 The most recent actuarial valuation of the Dalgety Pension Fund was at 31 March 2006.
The valuation of the scheme used the projected unit method and was carried out by professionally qualified actuaries.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary based on accurate calculations carried out as at 31 March 2006 updated to 30 June 2008.
For the purposes of their calculations, the Dalgety Pension Fund actuary have offset the value of the annuity policies and the element of the surplus under the control of the trustees.
New employees are no longer able to join the scheme.
Under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members approach retirement.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2006 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets would be 6.0% per annum before retirement and 3.6% per annum after retirement, that pay increases would average 4.0% per annum and that the annual increase in pensions in payment would be 2.8% per annum.
The market value of the assets of the fund at 31 March 2006, excluding additional voluntary contributions, is 55.0m.
Following the disposal of several businesses, the Directors and the trustees made an agreement in 2000 on the future operation of the fund.
This agreement apportioned part of the fund surplus for use of the trustees for augmenting members benefits.
After offsetting the element of surplus under the control of the trustees, the market value of the remaining available assets at 31 March 2006 was 18.7m.
The value of those assets represents approximately 94% of the value of the residual uninsured liabilities which were 19.9m at 31 March 2006, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Based on the actuarial assumptions, and allowing for the amortisation of the deficit over the average remaining service of current employees, the actuary has calculated that the Groups pension cost for the scheme is 0.2m.
24 - 40 Other defined benefit scheme in deficit The Group also operates a closed defined benefit scheme for a small number of former employees of the National Pig Development Company Limited.
The total market value of scheme assets and liabilities at 30 June 2008 under the provisions of IAS 19 were 3.0m 2007: 3.3m and 4.1m 2007: 4.1m, respectively.
Employer contributions of 90,000 2007: 30,000 were made into the scheme during the year.
Other unfunded schemes From the acquisition of Sygen International plc, the Group acquired three unfunded defined benefit schemes and an unfunded retirement health benefit plan, which it now operates for the benefit of the previous groups senior employees and executives.
For the three unfunded defined benefit schemes, based on the methods and assumptions of IAS 19 the scheme liabilities amount to 4.5m 2007: 5.1m and this amount is included within pension liabilities in the Groups balance sheet.
The current cost charged to operating profit amounted to nil 2007: nil and the interest on pension scheme liabilities amounted to 0.3m 2007: 0.3m.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities were that the discount rate would be 6.5% 2007: 5.7%, that pay increases would average nil% per annum 2007: nil% and that inflation and pension payments would be 4.0% per annum 2007: 4.0%.
For the unfunded retirement health benefit plan, based on the methods and assumptions of IAS 19, scheme liabilities amount to 1.3m 2007: 1.4m and this amount is included within retirement benefit obligations in the Groups balance sheet.
The current cost charged 41 - 104 to operating profit amounted to nil 2007: nil and the interest on plan liabilities amounted to 0.1m 2007: 0.1m.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the plan liabilities were that the discount rate would be 6.5% 2007: 5.7% and that the long term rate of medical expense inflation would be 8.0% 2007: 7.2%.
