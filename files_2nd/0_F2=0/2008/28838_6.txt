e Uncertainties The uncertainty arising under insurance contracts may be characterised under a number of specific headings, such as: uncertainty as to whether an event has occurred which would give rise to a policyholder suffering an insured loss: uncertainty as to the extent of policy coverage and limits applicable: uncertainty as to the amount of insured loss suffered by a policyholder as a result of the event occurring: and uncertainty over the timing of a settlement to a policyholder for a loss suffered.
125 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2008 The degree of uncertainty will vary by policy class according to the characteristics of the insured risks and the cost of a claim will be determined by the actual loss suffered by the policyholder.
There may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is actually reported to the Group.
Following the identification and notification of an insured loss, there may still be uncertainty as to the magnitude and timing of the settlement of the claim.
There are many factors that will determine the level of uncertainty such as inflation, inconsistent judicial interpretations and court judgements that broaden policy coverage beyond the intent of the original insurance, legislative changes and claims handling procedures.
The establishment of insurance liabilities is an inherently uncertain process and, as a consequence of this uncertainty, the eventual cost of settlement of outstanding claims and unexpired risks can vary substantially from the initial estimates, particularly for the Groups long tail lines of business.
The Group seeks to provide appropriate levels of claims provision and provision for unexpired risks taking the known facts and experience into account.
The Group has exposures to risks in each class of business within each operating segment that may develop and that could have a material impact upon the Groups financial position.
The insurance risk diversity within the Groups portfolio of issued insurance policies make it not possible to predict whether material development will occur and, if it does occur, the location and the timing of such an occurrence.
The estimation of insurance liabilities involves the use of judgments and assumptions that are specific to the insurance risks within each territory and the particular type of insurance risk covered.
The diversity of the insurance risks results in it not being possible to identify individual judgments and assumptions that are more likely than others to have a material impact on the future development of the insurance liabilities.
The sections below identify a number of specific risks relating to asbestos and environmental claims.
There may be other classes of risk which could develop in the future and that could have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
The Group evaluates the concentration of exposures to individual and cumulative insurance risk and establishes its reinsurance policy to reduce such exposure to levels acceptable to the Group.
Asbestos and environmental claims The estimation of the provisions for the ultimate cost of claims for asbestos and environmental pollution is subject to a range of uncertainties that is generally greater than those encountered for other classes of insurance business.
As a result it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as with other types of claims, particularly in periods when theories of law are in flux.
Consequently, traditional techniques for estimating claims provisions cannot wholly be relied upon and the Group employs specialised techniques to determine provisions using the extensive knowledge of both internal asbestos and environmental pollution experts and external legal and professional advisors.
Factors contributing to this higher degree of uncertainty include: the long delay in reporting claims from the date of exposure for example, cases of mesothelioma can have a latent period of up to 40 years.
This makes estimating the ultimate number of claims we will receive particularly difficult: issues of allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and insurers: emerging court decisions and the possibility of retrospective legislative changes increasing or decreasing insurer liability: the tendency for social trends and factors to influence court awards : developments pertaining to the Groups ability to recover reinsurance for claims of this nature: and 126 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2008 for US liabilities from our London market business, developments in the tactics of US plaintiff lawyers and court decisions and awards.
Acquisitions and disposals The Group makes acquisitions and disposals of businesses as part of its normal operations.
All acquisitions are made after due diligence, which will include, amongst other matters, assessment of the adequacy of claims reserves, assessment of the recoverability of reinsurance balances, inquiries with regard to outstanding litigation and inquiries of local regulators and taxation authorities.
Consideration is also given to potential costs, risks and issues in relation to the integration of any proposed acquisitions with existing RSA operations.
The Group will seek to receive the benefit of appropriate contractual representations and warranties in connection with any acquisition and, where necessary, additional indemnifications in relation to specific risks although there can be no guarantee that such protection will be adequate in all circumstances.
The Group may also provide relevant representations, warranties and indemnities to counterparties on any disposal.
While such representations, warranties and indemnities are essential components of many contractual relationships, they do not represent the underlying purpose for the transaction.
These clauses are customary in such contracts and may from time to time lead to us receiving claims from counterparties.
Contracts with third parties The Group enters into joint ventures, outsourcing contracts and distribution arrangements with third parties in the normal course of its business and is reliant upon those third parties being willing and able to perform their obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contracts.
Litigation, disputes and investigations The Group, in common with the insurance industry in general, is subject to litigation, mediation and arbitration, and regulatory, governmental and other sectoral inquiries and investigations in the normal course of its business.
The directors do not believe that any current mediation, arbitration, regulatory, governmental or sectoral inquiries and investigations and pending or threatened litigation or dispute will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position, although there can be no assurance that losses resulting from any pending mediation, arbitration, regulatory, governmental or sectoral inquiries and investigations and threatened litigation or dispute will not materially affect the Groups financial position or cash flows for any period.
Reinsurance The Group is exposed to disputes on, and defects in, contracts with its reinsurers and the possibility of default by its reinsurers.
The Group is also exposed to the credit risk assumed in fronting arrangements and to potential reinsurance capacity constraints.
In selecting the reinsurers with whom we do business our strategy is to seek reinsurers with the best combination of financial strength, price and capacity.
We publish internally a list of authorised reinsurers who pass our selection process and which our operations may use for new transactions.
The RSA Insurance Group monitors the financial strength of its reinsurers, including those to whom risks are no longer ceded.
Allowance is made in the Group financial position for non recoverability due to reinsurer default by providing, in line with RSA Insurance Group standards, having regard to companies on the RSAIGs Watch List.
The Watch List is the list of companies whom the RSAIGs directors believe will not be able to pay amounts due in full.
Investment risk The Group is exposed to market risk and credit risk on its invested assets.
Market risk includes the risk of potential losses from adverse movements in market rates and prices including interest rates, equity prices, property prices and foreign currency exchange rates.
The Groups exposure to market 127 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2008 risks is controlled by the setting of investment limits in line with the RSA Insurance Groups risk appetite.
From time to time the Group also makes use of derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity markets.
The Group has strict controls over the use of derivative instruments.
Credit risk includes the non performance of contractual payment obligations on invested assets and adverse changes in the credit worthiness of invested assets including exposures to issuers or counterparties for bonds, equities, deposits and derivatives.
Limits are set at both a portfolio and counterparty level based on likelihood of default to manage the RSA Insurance Groups and the Groups overall credit profile and specific concentrations within risk appetite.
Our insurance investment portfolios are concentrated in listed securities with very low levels of exposure to assets without quoted market prices.
We use model based analysis to verify asset values when market values are not readily available.
Changes in foreign exchange rates may impact our results We publish our financial statements in pounds sterling.
Therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates used to translate other currencies, particularly other European currencies and the US dollar, into pounds sterling will impact our reported financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from period to period.
These fluctuations in exchange rates will also impact the pound sterling value of our investments and the return on our investments.
Income and expenses for each Profit & Loss Account item are translated at average exchange rates.
Balance sheet assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Rating environment The ability of the Group to write certain types of insurance business is dependent on the maintenance of the appropriate credit ratings from the rating agencies.
The RSA Insurance Group has the objective of maintaining single A ratings.
At the present time the ratings are A stable from S&P upgraded from A-in December 2007, A excellent from AM Best upgraded from Ain February 2009 and A2 stable from Moodys upgraded from A3 in December 2008.
Any worsening in the ratings could have an adverse impact on the ability of the RSA Insurance Group and the Group to write certain types of general insurance business.
In assessing credit risk in relation to reinsurance and investments, the RSA Insurance Group takes into account a variety of factors, including credit rating.
If any such rating changes, or is otherwise reassessed, this has potential implications for the related exposures.
Regulatory environment The legal, regulatory and accounting environment is subject to significant change in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including developments in response to changes in the economic and political environment.
We continue to monitor the developments and react accordingly.
In particular the Group is continuing to monitor and respond to developments relating to the Solvency II Framework Directive, which is intended, in the medium term, to achieve greater harmonisation of approach across European member states to assessing capital resources and requirements.
The directors are confident that the Group will continue to meet all future regulatory capital requirements.

2007 Material connected-party transactions A number of reinsurance contracts are in place between the companies listed on page 141.
No individual contract is material and all are entered into on arms length basis.
RSAI has contracts with other RSA Insurance Group Companies for which movements during the year represent the claims run off experience.
In 2003 RSAI wrote an Adverse Development Cover ADC contract with its former US subsidiary Royal Indemnity Company.
As part of the disposal of the US operation, and as publicly disclosed in 2006, the original contract was amended and restated.
The liabilities arising under the ADC contract comprise an insurance component and a deposit component.
The liability arising under the insurance component of 0.1bn represents the timing risk on the settlement of those liabilities.
The financial liability arising under the deposit component is offset by the value of funds held in a trust fund whose trust deed only permits the trust fund assets to be used to settle amounts due under the ADC.
The value of the funds held in trust at 31 December 2008 is 0.6bn and the value of the liability of the deposit component is 0.6bn.
