Vodafone Financials Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 6.
Taxation continued At 31 March 2008, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward are as follows: Expiring Expiring within within 5 years 6-10 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 275 24 901 1,200 Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised 226 332 86,780 87,338 501 356 87,681 88,538 Included above are losses amounting to 1,969 million 2007: 1,938 million in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
The losses above also include 82,204 million 2007: 41,298 million that have arisen in overseas holding companies as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes.
Since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
In addition to the losses described above, the Group has potential tax losses of 40,181 million 2007: 34,292 million in respect of a write down in the value of investments in Germany.
These losses have to date been denied by the German tax authorities.
Vodafone is in continuing discussions with them regarding the availability of the losses.
However, the outcome of these discussions and the timing of the resolution are not yet known.
The Group has not recognised the availability of the losses, nor the income statement benefit arising from them, due to this uncertainty.
If upon resolution a benefit is recognised, it may impact both the amount of current income taxes provided since the date of initial deduction and the amount of the benefit from tax losses the Group will recognise.
The recognition of these benefits could affect the overall profitability of the Group in future periods.
The 5,889 million increase compared to the position at 31 March 2007 is due to foreign exchange, as a result of sterling weakening against the euro.
The Group holds provisions in respect of deferred taxation that would arise if temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures were to be realised after the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 49,000 million 2007: 34,946 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings.
