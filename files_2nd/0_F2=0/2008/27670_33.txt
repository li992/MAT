NOTES TO THE OLD MUTUAL MARKET CONSISTENT EMBEDDED VALUE BASIS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION For the year ended 31 December 2008 continued 1 Basis of preparation The Old Mutual Market Consistent Embedded Value methodology referred to herein and in the supplementary statements on pages 281 to 327 as MCEV adopts Market Consistent Embedded Value Principles issued in June 2008 by the CFO Forum the Principles as the basis for the methodology used in preparing the supplementary information.
The Principles have been fully complied with for all businesses as at 31 December 2008, with the exception of the use of an adjusted risk free rate due to current market conditions for US Life Onshore business.
The Group has replaced the European Embedded Value EEV basis with the MCEV basis for the covered business and gures for 31 December 2007 have been restated accordingly, and complies fully with all of the Principles.
The Principles were designed during a period of relatively stable market conditions and their application could, in turbulent markets, lead to misleading results.
In December 2008 the CFO Forum announced that they are reviewing the Principles and guidance of the application of these Principles to address the notion of market consistency in the current dislocated market conditions.
The particular areas under review include implied volatilities, the cost of residual non-hedgeable risks, the use of swap rates as a proxy for risk free reference rates and the effect of liquidity premia.
In respect of the 31 December 2008 disclosure, Old Mutual has made an adjustment to the risk free rate used in determining the value of the US Life Onshore business, to take account of the liquidity component of corporate bond spreads that is evident in the market as at 31 December 2008.
The Directors consider this adjustment to be necessary so as to ensure a meaningful basis of reporting the value of the Groups life and related businesses.
The 31 December 2008 MCEV disclosure in respect of all other business units complies fully with the Principles.
The detailed methodology and assumptions made in presenting this supplementary information, including the US adjusted risk free rate for 31 December 2008, information are set out in notes 2 and 3.
This supplementary information provides details on the methodology, assumptions and results of the MCEV for the Old Mutual Group and includes conversion of comparative supplementary information for 2007, previously prepared on the EEV basis, to a MCEV basis.
Throughout the supplementary information the following terminology is used to distinguish between the terms MCEV, Group MCEV and adjusted Group MCEV: MCEV is a measure of the consolidated value of shareholders interests in the covered business and consists of the sum of the shareholders adjusted net worth in respect of the covered business and the value of the in-force covered business.
Group MCEV is a measure of the consolidated value of shareholders interests in covered and non-covered business and therefore includes the value of all non-covered business at the unadjusted IFRS net asset value detailed in the primary financial statements.
The adjusted Group MCEV, a measure used by the directors to assess the shareholders interest in the value of the Group, includes the impact of marking all debt to market value, the market value of the Groups listed banking and general insurance subsidiaries as well as marking the value of deferred consideration due in respect of Black Economic Empowerment arrangements in South Africa the BEE schemes to market.
The major change in Old Mutuals overall approach for deriving its MCEV compared to the approach adopted for EEV is the allowance for risk.
Under MCEV a bottom-up allowance is made for financial risks in particular, asset and liability cash ows are valued using risk discount rates consistent with those applied to similar cash ows in the capital markets and financial options and guarantees are valued using market consistent models calibrated to observable market prices and an explicit allowance is made for the cost of residual non-hedgeable risks in the covered business.
In contrast, under EEV a top-down allowance was made for all risks by means of the risk margin included in the single risk discount rate applicable for each geography and the value placed on the time value of financial options and guarantees.
The MCEV methodology therefore makes a more granular allowance for the differences in the risk pro le of different blocks of business than the EEV methodology.
Further detailed commentary of the key changes from an EEV to MCEV methodology and the impact of the transition from EEV to MCEV reporting on results for the financial year ended 31 December 2007 are provided in notes 12 to 18.
2 Methodology Introduction MCEV represents the present value of shareholders interests in the earnings distributable from assets allocated to the in-force covered business after suf cient allowance for the aggregate risks in the covered business and is measured in a way that is consistent with the value that would normally be placed on the cash ows generated by these assets and liabilities in a deep and liquid market.
MCEV is therefore a risk-adjusted measure to the extent that financial risk is re ected through the use of market consistent techniques in the valuation of both assets and distributable earnings and a transparent explicit allowance is made for nonfinancial risks.
The MCEV consists of the sum of the following components: Adjusted net worth, which excludes acquired intangibles and goodwill, consisting of: Free surplus allocated to the covered business Required capital to support the covered business Value of in-force covered business VIF Page 284 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 2 Methodology continued The adjusted net worth of the covered business is the market value of shareholders assets held in respect of the covered business after allowance for the liabilities of the in-force covered business which are dictated by local regulatory reserving requirements.
MCEV is calculated net of minority shareholder interests and excludes the value of future new business.
Coverage Covered business includes, where material, any contracts that are regarded by local insurance supervisors as long-term life insurance business.
This generally means that covered business includes all product lines where the pro ts are included in the IFRS long-term business pro ts in the primary Financial Statements.
For the South African business, healthcare administration business is no longer recognised as part of the VIF or value of new business of covered business as previously reported under EEV.
Some types of business are legally written by a life Company, but under IFRS this business is classi ed as asset management because long-term business only serves as a wrapper.
This business continues to be excluded from covered business, for example: New institutional investment platform pensions business written in the United Kingdom as it is more appropriately classi ed as mutual fund business: and Individual unit trusts and some group market-linked business written by the asset management Companies in South Africa through the life Company as pro ts from this business arise in the asset management Companies.
The treatment within this supplementary information of all business other than the covered business is the same as in the primary financial statements, except for the adjusted Group MCEV which includes the impact of marking all debt to market value, the market value of the Groups listed banking and general insurance subsidiaries as well as marking the value of deferred consideration due in respect of Black Economic Empowerment arrangements in South Africa the BEE schemes to market.
Free surplus Free surplus is the market value of any assets allocated to, but not required to support, the covered in-force business.
It is determined as the market value of any excess assets attributed to the covered business but not backing the regulatory liabilities, less the required capital to support the covered business.
Required capital Required capital is the market value of assets that are attributed to support the covered business, over and above that required to back statutory liabilities for covered business, whose distribution to shareholders is restricted.
The following capital measures are considered in determining the required capital held for covered business so that it re ects the level of capital considered by the directors to be appropriate to manage the business: Economic capital: Regulatory capital i. e. the level of solvency capital at which the local regulators are empowered to take action with appropriate deductions being made for any implicit items that are not allowed by local regulators: Capital required by rating agencies in respect of our North American business in order to maintain our desired credit rating: and Any other required capital fide nition to meet internal management objectives.
Economic capital for the covered business is based upon our own internal assessment of risks inherent in the underlying business.
It measures capital requirements on an economic balance sheet, with MCEV as the available capital, consistent with a 99.93 percent con dence level over a one-year time horizon.
For Europe and South Africa capital determined with reference to internal management objectives is the most onerous and is the capital measure used, whereas in the United States the required capital is based on the amount that management deems necessary to maintain the desired credit rating for the Company.
The required capital in respect of the South Africa covered business is partially covered by the market value of the Groups investments in banking and general insurance in South Africa.
On consolidation these investments are shown separately.
The table below shows the level of required capital expressed as a percentage of the minimum local regulatory capital requirements.

PVFP The PVFP is calculated as the discounted value of future distributable earnings taking account of local statutory reserving requirements that are expected to emerge from the in-force covered business, including the value of renewals of in-force business, on a best estimate basis where assumed earned rates of return and discount rates are equal to the risk free reference rates.
It therefore represents a deterministic certainty equivalent valuation of future distributable earnings.
The certainty equivalent valuation approach is described in more detail in note 3.
Any limitations on distribution of such earnings due to statutory or internal capital requirements are taken into account separately in the calculation of frictional costs of required capital.
PVFP captures the intrinsic and time value of financial options and guarantees on in-force covered business which are included in the local statutory reserves according to local requirements, but excludes any additional allowance for the time value of financial options and guarantees.
Financial options and guarantees Allowance is made in the MCEV for the potential impact of variability of investment returns i. e. asymmetric impact on future shareholder cash ows of policyholder financial options and guarantees within the in-force covered business.
The time value of financial options and guarantees describes that part of the value of financial options and guarantees that arises from the variability of future investment returns on assets to the extent that it is not already included in the statutory reserves.
The calculations are based on market consistent stochastic modelling techniques where the actual assets held at the valuation date are used as the starting point for the valuation of such financial options and guarantees.
Projected cash ows are valued using economic assumptions such that they are valued in line with the price of similar cash ows that are traded in the capital markets.
The time value represents the difference between the average value of shareholder cash ows under many generated economic scenarios and the deterministic shareholder value under the best estimate assumptions for the equivalent business.
Closed form solutions are also applied in Europe provided the nature of any guarantees is not complex.
The time value of financial options and guarantees also includes allowance for potential burn-through costs on participating business, i. e. the extent to which shareholders are unable to recover a loan made to participating funds to meet either regulatory or internal capital management requirements or the extent to which reserves are inadequate to cover severely adverse experience.
In the generated economic scenarios allowance is made, where appropriate, for the effect of dynamic management and or policyholder actions in different circumstances: Management has some discretion in managing exposure to financial options and guarantees, particularly within participating business.
Such dynamic management actions are re ected in the valuation of financial options and guarantees provided that such discretion is consistent with established and justi able practice taking into account policyholders reasonable expectations e. g. with due consideration of the PPFM for South African business, subject to any contractual guarantees and regulatory or legal constraints and has been passed through an appropriate approval process by the local Executive team and, where applicable, the Board.
Assumptions that depend on the market performance such as crediting rates or bonus rates are set relative to the risk free reference rates subject to contractual guarantees and assuming that all market participants are subjected to the same market conditions.
Where credible evidence exists that persistency rates are linked to economic scenarios, allowance is made for dynamic policyholder behaviour in response to changes in economic conditions.
Modelled dynamic management and policyholders actions include the following: Changes in future bonus and crediting rates subject to contractual guarantees, including removing all or part of previously declared non-vested bonuses where circumstances warrant such action: Dynamic persistency rates for the United States business and dynamic guaranteed annuity option take-up rates for the South African business driven by changes in economic conditions and management actions: Changes in surrender values: and Option take-up rates vary stochastically for the South African business to the extent that the value of those options change in different economic conditions.
In determining the time value of financial options and guarantees at least 1,000 simulations are run to gain comfort that a reasonable degree of convergence of results has has been obtained.
Where deemed appropriate, the number of simulations is increased to reduce sampling error.
Page 286 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 2 Methodology continued Financial options and guarantees continued Europe Whilst certain products within the European businesses provide financial options and guarantees, these are immaterial due to the predominantly unit-linked nature of the business.
South Africa The time value of the financial options and guarantees mainly relates to maturity guarantees and guaranteed annuity options.
As required by the applicable Actuarial Society of South Africa guidance note, the time value of the financial options and guarantees included in the statutory reserves in the South African businesses as at 31 December 2008 has been valued using a risk-neutral market consistent asset model, and is referred to as an investment guarantee reserve.
This reserve includes a discretionary margin as fide ned by local guidelines to allow for the sensitivity of the reserve to interest rate movements.
This discretionary margin is valued in the VIF.
United States The time value of the financial options and guarantees mainly relates to minimum crediting bonus and growth rates.
Frictional costs of required capital From the shareholders viewpoint there is a cost due to restrictions on the distribution of required capital that is locked in the Company.
Where material, an allowance has been made for the frictional costs in respect of the taxation on investment return income and capital gains and investment costs on the assets backing the required capital for covered business.
The allowance for taxation is based on the taxation rates applicable to investment earnings on assets backing the required capital, although such tax rates are reduced, where applicable, to allow for interest paid on debt which is used to partly finance the required capital.
The run-off pattern of the required capital is projected on an approximate basis over the lifetime of the underlying risks in line with drivers of the capital requirement.
The same drivers are used to split the total required capital between existing business and new business.
Cost of residual non-hedgeable risks Suf cient allowance for most financial risks has been made in the PVFP and the time value of financial options and guarantees by using techniques that are similar to the approach used by capital markets.
In addition the modelling of some non-hedgeable nonfinancial risks is incorporated as part of the calculation of the PVFP e. g. to the extent that expected operational losses are incorporated in the maintenance expense assumptions or the time value of financial options and guarantees e. g. dynamic policyholder behaviour such as the interaction of the investment scenario and the persistency rates.
All residual nonfinancial risks e. g. liability risks such as mortality, longevity and morbidity risks: business risks such as persistency, expense and reinsurance credit risks: and operational risk for which no or insuf cient allowance is made in the PVFP or time value of financial options and guarantees, together with hedge risk and credit spread risk in the United States, are considered within the allowance for the cost of residual non-hedgeable risks.
An allowance is made in the cost of residual non-hedgeable risks to re ect uncertainty in the best estimate of shareholder cash ows as a result of both symmetric and asymmetric non-hedgeable risks since these risks can not be hedged in deep and liquid capital markets and are managed, inter alia, by holding risk capital.
Considering the Group as a whole, most residual non-hedgeable risks have a symmetric impact on shareholder value with the exception of operational risk.
The cost of residual non-hedgeable risks is calculated using a cost of capital approach, i. e. it is determined as the present value of capital charges for all future non-hedgeable risk capital requirements until run-off of the liabilities.
The capital charge in each year is the product of the projected expected non-hedgeable risk capital held after allowance for some diversi cation bene ts and the cost of capital rate.
The cost of capital rate therefore represents the return above the risk free reference rates that the market is deemed to demand for providing this capital.
The residual non-hedgeable risk capital measure is determined using an internal economic capital model based on appropriate shock scenarios consistent with a 99.5 percent con dence level over a one-year time horizon.
The internal economic capital model makes allowance for certain management actions, such as reductions in bonus and crediting rates, where deemed appropriate.
Page 287 MCEV nancials MCEV nancials NOTES TO THE OLD MUTUAL MARKET CONSISTENT EMBEDDED VALUE BASIS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION For the year ended 31 December 2008 continued 2 Methodology continued Cost of residual non-hedgeable risks continued The following allowance is made for diversi cation bene ts in determining the residual non-hedgeable risk capital at a business unit level: Diversi cation bene ts within the non-hedgeable risks of the covered business are allowed for.
No allowance is made for diversi cation bene ts between hedgeable and non-hedgeable risks of the covered business.
No allowance is made for diversi cation bene ts between covered and non-covered business.
The table below shows the amounts of diversi ed economic capital held in respect of residual non-hedgeable risks.
Total Europe South Africa United States m m m m 31 December 2008 Non-hedgeable risk capital 2,003 720 457 826 31 December 2007 Non-hedgeable risk capital 1,535 714 461 360 A weighted average cost of capital rate of 2.0 percent has been applied to residual symmetric and asymmetric non-hedgeable risks at a business unit level over the life of the contracts.
This translates into an equivalent cost of capital rate of approximately 3.25 percent being applied to the Group diversi ed capital required in respect of such non-hedgeable risks.
Participating business For participating business in South Africa and the United States, the method of valuation makes assumptions about future bonus or crediting rates and the determination of pro t allocation between policyholders and shareholders.
These assumptions are made on a basis consistent with other projection assumptions, especially the projected future investment returns, established Company practice with due consideration of the PPFM for South African business, past external communication, any payout smoothing strategy, local market practice, regulatory contractual restrictions and bonus participation rules.
Where current bene t levels are higher than can be supported by the existing fund assets together with projected investment returns, a downward glide path is projected in bene t levels so that the fund would be exhausted on payment of the last bene t. Spread-based products A market consistent valuation of spread-based products such as xed indexed annuities in the United States where investment returns are earned at one rate and policyholders accounts are credited at a different rate with the difference referred to as spread is dependent on the extent that management discretion can target a shareholder pro t margin and the decision rules that management would follow in respect of crediting or bonus rates in any particular stochastic scenario.
Where guaranteed terms are offered at outset of a contract that dictate the payments to policyholders throughout the term of the contract, these payments are valued using the certainty equivalent valuation technique.
These products, for example immediate annuities in payment, may therefore show a loss at point of sale under MCEV as investment margins are not anticipated while currently pricing practice does anticipate these margins.
If returns in excess of the risk free reference rates actually emerge in the future, these will be recognised in the MCEV earnings as they arise.
For business where the crediting bonus rate is set in advance, crediting rates are set by considering managements target shareholder margins throughout the contract lifetime subject to any guarantees.
Projected crediting rates are set equal to the risk free reference rate less the anticipated margin to cover pro t and expenses subject to any policyholder guarantees eroding the shareholder margins.
However, during the period following the valuation date the existing crediting rate is applied until the next point at which it can be varied.
Given the guarantees included within such products including consideration of a zero percent oor for crediting rates, stochastic modelling is used to value such contracts.
Valuation of assets and treatment of unrealised losses The market values of assets, where quoted, are based on the bid price on the reporting date.
Unquoted assets are valued according to IFRS and marked to model.
No smoothing of market values or unrealised gains losses is applied.
Asset mix PVFP and the time value of financial options and guarantees are calculated using assets projected on the actual asset allocation of the policyholder funds at the reporting date.
However, if the current asset mix is materially different to the long-term strategic asset allocation as a result of market movements, projected assets are assumed to revert to the long-term strategic asset allocation in the short to medium term as appropriate.
Page 288 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 2 Methodology continued fide ned bene t pension scheme Where a fide ned bene t pension scheme within the covered business is in surplus or fide cit, the employer pension fund expense assumptions incorporated within the VIF allow appropriately for the expected release of surplus or funding of the fide cit.
Look through principle PVFP and value of new business cash ow projections look through and include the pro ts losses of owned service companies, e. g. distribution and administration, related to the management of the covered business.
Any pro t margins that are included in investment management fees payable by the life assurance companies to the asset management subsidiaries have not been included in the value of in-force business or the value of new business on the grounds of materiality and because a signi cant proportion of these pro ts arise from performance-based fees.
Taxation In valuing shareholders cash ows, allowance is made in the cash ow projections for taxes in the relevant jurisdiction affecting the covered business.
Tax assumptions are based on best estimate assumptions, applying current local corporate tax legislation and practice together with known future changes and taking credit for any deferred tax assets.
No allowance is made for any further additional tax that would be incurred on the remittance of dividends from the life subsidiaries to Old Mutual plc, apart from the South African business where full allowance has been made for Secondary Tax on Companies STC at a rate of 10 percent that may be payable in South Africa and the impact of capital gains tax.
Furthermore, for the South African business it has been assumed that a reasonable proportion of the shareholder fund equity portfolio excluding Group subsidiaries will be traded each year.
In Europe tax has been allowed for on dividends to be remitted to Skandia UK from the Isle of Man.
The value of any deferred tax assets is only recognised in the MCEV in so far as those tax assets are expected to be utilised in future by offsetting it against expected tax liabilities that are generated on expected pro ts emerging from in-force business.
Since projected investment returns are based on the risk free reference rates, MCEV may therefore understate the true economic value of such deferred tax assets.
New business and renewals The market consistent value of new business VNB measures the value of the future pro ts expected to emerge from all new business sold, and in some cases increases to existing contracts, during the reporting period after allowance for the time value of financial options and guarantees, frictional costs and the cost of residual non-hedgeable risks associated with writing the new business.
VNB includes contractual renewal of premiums and recurring single premiums, where the level of premium is pre-fide ned and is reasonably predictable, and changes to existing contracts where these are not variations allowed for in the PVFP.
Non-contractual increments are treated similarly where the volume of such increments is reasonably predictable or likely e. g. where premiums are expected to increase in line with salary or price in ation.
Any variations in premiums on renewal of in-force business from that previously anticipated including deviations in non-contractual increases, deviations in recurrent single premiums and re-pricing of premiums for in-force business are treated as experience variances on in-force business and not as new business.
VNB is calculated as follows: Using economic assumptions at the start of the reporting period.
Using demographic and operating assumptions at the end of the reporting period.
At point of sale and rolled forward to the end of the reporting period.
Generally using a standalone approach unless a marginal approach would better re ect the additional value to shareholders created through the activity of writing new business.
Expense allowances include all acquisition expenses, including any acquisition expense overruns.
Net of tax, reinsurance and minority interests.
No attribution of any investment and operating variances to VNB.
New business margins are disclosed as: The ratio of VNB to the present value of new business premiums PVNBP : and The ratio of VNB to annual premium equivalent APE, where APE is calculated as recurring premiums plus 10 percent of single premiums.
PVNBP is calculated at point of sale using premiums before reinsurance and applying a valuation approach that is consistent with the calculation of VNB.
Page 289 MCEV nancials MCEV nancials NOTES TO THE OLD MUTUAL MARKET CONSISTENT EMBEDDED VALUE BASIS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION For the year ended 31 December 2008 continued 2 Methodology continued Analysis of MCEV earnings An analysis of MCEV earnings provides a reconciliation of the MCEV for covered business at the beginning of the reporting period and the MCEV for covered business at the end of the reporting period on a net of taxation basis.
Operating MCEV earnings are generated by the value of new business sold during the reporting period, the expected existing business contribution, operating experience variances, operating assumption changes and other operating variances: The value of new business includes the impact of new business strain on free surplus that arises, amongst other things, from the impact of initial expenses and additional required capital that should be held in respect of such new business.
The expected existing business contribution is determined by projecting both actual assets and actual liabilities including assets backing the free surplus and required capital from the start of the reporting period to the end of the reporting period using expected real-world earned rates of return.
The expected existing business contribution is presented in two components: Expected earnings on free surplus and required capital and the expected change in VIF assuming that the assets earn the beginning of period risk free reference rates: and Additional expected earnings on free surplus and required capital and the additional expected change in VIF as a result of real-world expected earned rates of return on assets in excess of beginning of period risk free reference rates.
Transfers from VIF and required capital to free surplus includes the release of required capital and modelled pro ts from VIF into free surplus in respect of business that was in-force at the beginning of the reporting period, although the movement does not contribute to a change in the MCEV.
Operating experience variances re ect the impact of deviations of the actual operational experience during the reporting period from the expected operational experience.
It is analysed before operating assumption changes, i. e. such variances are assessed against opening operating assumptions, and re ects the total impact of in-force and new business variances.
Operating assumption changes incorporate the impact of changes to operating assumptions from those assumed at the beginning of the reporting period to those assumed at the end of the reporting period.
As VNB is calculated using operating assumptions at the end of the reporting period, this impact only relates to the value of in-force business at the end of the reporting period.
Other operating variances include model improvements, changes in methodology and the impact of certain management actions, such as a change in the asset allocation backing required capital.
Total MCEV earnings also include economic variances and other non-operating variances: Economic variances incorporate the impact of changes in economic assumptions from the beginning of the reporting period to the end of the reporting period as well as the impact on earnings resulting from actual returns on assets being different to the expected returns on those assets as re ected in the expected existing business contribution.
It therefore also includes the impact of economic variances in the reporting period on projected future earnings.
Other non-operating variances include the impact of changes in mandatory local regulations and changes in taxation.
An analysis of MCEV earnings requires closing adjustments in respect of exchange rate movements and capital transfers such as those in respect of payment of dividends and acquiring divesting businesses.
Return on MCEV for covered business is calculated as the operating MCEV earnings after tax divided by opening MCEV in local currency, except for total covered business where the calculations are performed in Sterling.
Analysis of Group MCEV earnings Presentation of Group MCEV consists of the covered business under the MCEV methodology and the non-covered business valued as the unadjusted IFRS net asset value.
A mark to market adjustment is therefore not performed for external borrowings and other items not on a mark to market basis under IFRS relating to non-covered business.
Page 290 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 3 Assumptions Non-economic assumptions The appropriate non-economic projection assumptions for future experience e. g. mortality, persistency and expenses are determined using best estimate assumptions of each component of future cash ows, are speci c to the entity concerned and has regard to past, current and expected future experience e. g. longevity improvements and AIDS-related claims as derived from both entity speci c and industry data where deemed appropriate.
Material assumptions are actively reviewed by means of detailed experience investigations and updated, as deemed appropriate, at least annually.
These assumptions are based on the covered business being part of a going concern, although favourable changes in maintenance expenses such as productivity improvements are generally not included beyond what has been achieved by the end of the reporting period.
The only exception is in respect of the United States business which is currently undergoing a major restructuring and cost-cutting exercise.
The expense assumption used in the calculation of MCEV takes into account cost reductions already achieved in the first quarter of 2009, but not any of the additional planned cost reductions.
The management expenses attributable to life assurance business have been analysed between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business, maintenance of in-force business including investment management expenses and development projects.
All expected maintenance expense overruns affecting the covered business are allowed for in the calculations.
Unallocated Group holding Company expenses have been included to the extent that they relate to the covered business.
The future expenses attributable to life assurance business include 35 percent of the Group holding Company expenses, with 14 percent allocated to South Africa, 4 percent allocated to United States and 17 percent allocated to Europe 31 December 2007: 37 percent of the Group holding Company expenses, with 15 percent allocated to South Africa, 5 percent allocated to United States and 17 percent allocated to Europe.
The allocation of these expenses aligns to the proportion that the management expenses incurred by the business bears to the total management expenses incurred in the Group.
The MCEV normally only makes provision for future development costs and one-off exceptional expenses such as those incurred on the integration of businesses following an acquisition and restructuring costs to the extent that such project costs are known with suf cient certainty.
However no such costs are allowed for as at 31 December 2008 or 31 December 2007.
Legislative changes were introduced in Germany in 2008 specifying the proportion of miscellaneous pro ts to be shared with policyholders.
According to the regulations, the revenue on in-force business can be reduced by various expense items, including those costs arising in respect of new business acquisition expenses in any year.
To model this, Skandia Leben has adopted an approach consistent with German market practice.
This approach is to set best estimate assumptions for the amount to be shared with policyholders in future years after allowing for the acquisition expenses in relation to the new business expected to be written over the next three years as per their business plan projections.
Economic assumptions An active basis is applied to set pre-tax investment and economic assumptions to re ect the economic conditions prevailing on the reporting date.
Economic assumptions are set consistently, for example future bonus or crediting rates are set at levels consistent with the investment return assumptions.
Under a market consistent valuation, economic assumptions are determined such that projected cash ows are valued in line with the prices of similar cash ows that are traded on the capital markets.
Thus, risk free cash ows are discounted at a risk free reference rate and equity cash ows at an equity rate.
In practice for the PVFP, where cash ows do not depend on or vary linearly with market movements, a certainty equivalent method is used which assumes that actual assets held earn, before tax and investment management expenses, risk free reference rates and all the cash ows are discounted using risk free reference rates which are gross of tax and investment management expenses.
The deterministic certainty equivalent method is purely a valuation technique and over time the expectation is still that risk premiums will be earned on assets such as equities and corporate bonds.
Risk free reference rates and in ation The risk free reference rates, reinvestment rates and discount rates are determined with reference to the swap yield curve appropriate to the currency of the cash ows.
For Europe the swap yield curve is obtained from a number of sources including Bloomberg, Nordea Bank and Reuters.
For the South African and United States businesses, the swap yield curve is sourced from the third party market consistent asset model that is used to generate the economic scenarios that are required to value the time value of financial options and guarantees.
No adjustments are made to swap yields to allow for liquidity premiums or credit risk premiums, apart from a liquidity adjustment to the United States Life onshore business at 31 December 2008.
Any other risk premiums are recognised within the MCEV as and when they are earned.
Following a review of a wide range of market data and literature, such as Barrie Hibbert calibration of US corporate bond spreads at 31 December 2008, it is the directors view that the signi cant widening of corporate bond spreads during the recent financial market turmoil is partly a function of an increased liquidity premium rather than only heightened default risk and that returns in excess of swap rates can be achieved, rather than entire corporate bond spreads being lost to worsening default experience.
For the United States onshore business we considered the currency, credit quality and duration of our actual corporate bond portfolio and derived adjusted risk free reference rates at 31 December 2008 by adding 300bps of liquidity premium to swap rates used for setting investment return and discounting assumptions 31 December 2007: no liquidity adjustment was applied as we did not anticipate at that time the extent to which the bond markets would become even further dislocated.
This adjustment re ects the liquidity premium component in corporate bond spreads over swap rates that we expect to earn on our portfolio.
We believe that the difference between market yields on our United States onshore bond portfolio and the adjusted risk free reference rate still provides an adequate implied margin for defaults.

At those durations where swap yields are not available, e. g. due to a lack of a suf ciently liquid or deep swap market, the swap curve is extended using appropriate interpolation and extrapolation techniques.
Consumer price in ation assumptions are determined as those implied by index-linked government stocks or real swap yields if a liquid market of suf cient size exists.
In other markets, the consumer price in ation assumptions are modelled considering a reasonable spread compared to swap rates.
However, where modelling system capabilities are restricted, consumer price in ation is set as a at assumption.
Other types of in ation such as expense in ation are derived on a consistent basis and, where deemed appropriate, include a percentage addition to the consumer price in ation rate as life Company expenses for example include a large element of salary related expenses.
The risk free reference spot yields inclusive of any applicable liquidity adjustments and expense in ation rates at various terms for each of the signi cant geographies are provided in the table below.
The risk free reference spot yield curve has been derived from mid swap rates at the reporting date.
Page 292 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 3 Assumptions continued Economic assumptions continued Volatilities and correlations Where cash ows contain financial options and guarantees such that they do not move linearly with market movements, asset cash ows are projected and all cash ows discounted using risk-neutral stochastic models.
These models project the assets and liabilities using a distribution of asset returns where all asset types, on average, earn the same risk free reference rate.
Apart from the risk free reference yields speci ed above, other key economic assumptions for the calibration of economic scenarios include the implied volatilities for each asset class and correlations between different asset classes.
The volatility assumptions for the calibration of economic scenarios that are used in the stochastic models are, where possible, based on those implied from appropriate derivative prices such as equity options in respect of guarantees that are dependent on changes in equity markets or swaptions in respect of guarantees that are dependent on changes in interest rates as observed on the valuation date.
However, historic implied and historic observed volatilities of the underlying instruments and expert opinion are considered where there are concerns over the depth or liquidity of the market, e. g. volatilities for property returns.
Where strict adherence to the above is not possible, for example where markets only exist at short durations such as the equity option market in South Africa, interpolation or extrapolation techniques are used to derive volatility assumptions for the full term structure of the liabilities.
Correlation assumptions between asset classes that are used in stochastic models are based on an assessment of historic relationships.
Where historic data is used in setting volatility or correlation assumptions, a suitable time period is considered for analysing historic data including consideration of the appropriateness of historical data where economic conditions were materially different to current conditions.
For the South African stochastic models, due to the immateriality of corporate bond and property holdings, corporate bonds are assumed to yield the same returns as equivalent long-term government bonds and property is assumed to be invested 50 percent in local equities and 50 percent in long-term government bonds.
The at-the-money annualised asset volatility assumptions of the asset classes incorporated in the stochastic models are detailed below.

Note that due to improvements in fund mapping during 2008, some different indices are referenced at 31 December 2008 than those referenced at 31 December 2007.
Exchange rates All MCEV gures are calculated in local currency and translated to GBP using the appropriate exchange rates as detailed in note 2 of the IFRS statements.
Expected asset returns in excess of the risk free reference rates The expected asset returns in excess of the risk free reference rates have no bearing on the calculated MCEV other than the calculation of the expected existing business contribution in the analysis of MCEV earnings.
Such real-world economic assumptions are determined with reference to one-year forward risk free reference rates applicable to the currency of the liabilities at the start of the reporting period.
All other economic assumptions, for example future bonus or crediting rates, are set at levels consistent with the real-world investment return assumptions.
Equity and property risk premiums incorporate both historical relationships and the directors view of future projected returns in each geography.
Pre-tax real-world economic assumptions are determined as follows: The equity risk premium is 3.5 percent for Africa and 3 percent for Europe and the United States.
The cash return equals the risk free reference rate less a deduction of 2 percent for Africa and 1 percent for Europe and the United States.
The corporate bond return is based on actual corporate bond spreads on the reporting date less an allowance for defaults.
The property risk premium is 2.5 percent in Africa and 2 percent in Europe.
Tax The effective tax rates for Nordic, United Kingdom and the balance of Europe were a range of 2 to 28 percent 2007: 2 to 28 percent, 29 percent 2007: 28 percent and a range of 8 to 31 percent 2007: 14 to 30 percent respectively.
The effective tax rate was 33 percent for South Africa 2007: 34 percent and zero percent for Namibia 2007: zero percent, except for the investment return on capital for which the attributed tax was derived from the primary accounts.
For the United States the effective rate was under 1 percent.

For the South African business ther e has been a material change in the asset allocation of assets backing required capital from 31 December 2007 to 31 December 2008.
As at 31 December 2008, signi cantly fewer assets are held in equities and more in cash compared to 31 December 2007.
The fide ned bene t plan funds allocated to the Nordic covered business are currently showing an aggregate surplus of 45m on an IAS 19 basis.
This amount has not been incorporated within the VIF by allowing for the expected release of surplus, nor has it been allowed within the ANW of the business.
Page 297 MCEV nancials MCEV nancials NOTES TO THE OLD MUTUAL MARKET CONSISTENT EMBEDDED VALUE BASIS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION For the year ended 31 December 2008 continued 4 iii Components of Market Consistent Embedded Value of the covered business continued For the United States, the material decrease in frictional costs from 38 million as at 31 December 2007 to 3 million as at 31 December 2008 re ects the changed tax position of the business between these two reporting dates on a market consistent basis.
The fact that there are greater losses projected on an MCEV basis at 31 December 2008 compared to 31 December 2007 mainly due to lower risk free reference rates means that future income on the capital required to back the business is to a large extent not subject to tax as such future income can be offset against current projected losses.
For the United States, the material increase in the cost of residual non-hedgeable risks from 53 million as at 31 December 2007 to 153 million as at 31 December 2008 results mainly from the introduction as at 31 December 2008 of an allowance for hedge risks on the Variable Annuity portfolio.
This allowance was not backdated to 31 December 2007 as issues with the effectiveness of the hedging programme, which has improved in the second half of 2008, only emerged during 2008.
The position at 31 December 2007 was restated based on the knowledge at the time, which included an expectation that the guarantee hedges would be more effective than actually experienced during 2008.
The opening MCEV for the year ended 31 December 2007 is gr oss of minority interest of 29 million in Skandia.
During 2007 all the minority shares were purchased.
Return on MCEV for total covered business is calculated as the operating MCEV earnings after tax divided by opening MCEV in Sterling.

This is reasonable for business comprised mostly of unit-linked products where most of the pro ts emanate from premium charges, acquisition charges and fund based fees.
Such fees and charges are largely captured in the expected existing business contribution reference rate.
The experience variances were driven by a higher level of fund rebate than that assumed, offset by a write-down of capitalised software costs.
The main operating assumption changes related to an increased recognition of fee income which was partly offset by a strengthening of expense assumptions.
The other operating variances mainly re ect the impact of modelling and methodology improvements.
The capital and dividend ows consist mainly of dividends.
The other non-operating variance is due to the implementation of a new actuarial system.

These were partially offset by one-off persistency effects due to a Swedish legislative change relating to the level of tax deductible savings contributions.
The main operating assumption changes related to a release of reserves set up for costs in the corporate business partially offset by strengthened persistency assumptions.
The other non-operating variance is mainly driven by legacy issues, such as the settlement of the Skandia Liv arbitration and strengthening of various legacy provisions.
The capital and dividend ows mainly represent dividends received, repayment of loans and settlement of the Liv arbitration.

The experience variances were driven by negative persistency experience and one-off and special project costs which were partially offset by favourable mortality and disability experience and positive maintenance expense experience.
The main operating assumption changes related to maintenance expense savings being re ected in the updated assumptions and the positive impact of changes in annuitant mortality assumptions which were offset by the negative impact of changes to persistency assumptions that have been reviewed in light of the recent adverse experience.
The other operating variances mainly include improvements in valuation models and methodology.
The other non-operating variances relate to reduction in the corporate tax rate from 29 percent to 28 percent and the impact of changing the asset allocation backing required capital.
The capital and dividend ows mainly include dividend payments net of dividends received from Nedbank and Mutual & Federal and increased investment in Old Mutual plc loan notes and the purchase of additional shares in Nedbank and Mutual & Federal.
These capital ows arose from excess capital and did not adversely affect the solvency position of the South African life company.

The negative experience variances were largely driven by higher than expected lapses on the xed deferred and indexed annuity products and by reinsurance deals which were priced to be broadly cost-neutral on a real-world basis.
Other negative experience variances included lighter than expected mortality on the immediate annuity book and an expense overrun.
There was an offsetting positive tax variance.
The main operating assumption changes related to a strengthening of mortality assumptions on part of the immediate annuity book, changes to variable annuity reserving and increased expense assumptions.
The capital and dividend ows were mainly due to capital injections from Old Mutual plc during the year.

The adjustment to include long-term business on a statutory solvency basis includes the following: The excess of the IFRS amount of the deferred acquisition cost DAC and value of business acquired VOBA assets over the statutory levels included in the VIF.
When projecting future pro ts on a statutory basis, the VIF includes the shareholders value of unrealised capital gains.
To the extent that assets in IFRS are valued at market and the market value is higher than the statutory book value, these pro ts have already been taken into account in the IFRS equity.

New business pro tability is measured by both the ratio of the VNB to the present value of new business premiums PVNBP as well as to the annual premium equivalent APE, and shown under PVNBP margin and APE margin below.
APE is calculated as recurring premiums plus 10 percent of single premiums.
As mentioned earlier for the South African business, healthcare administration business is no longer recognised as part of the VNB of covered business as previously reported under EEV.
A similar consideration applies to other new business measures such as PVNBP and APE.

The value of new business also excludes premium increases arising from indexation arrangements in respect of existing business, as these are already included in the value of in-force business.
The value of new institutional investment platform pensions business written in the United Kingdom, the gross premium of which amounted to 239 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 year ended 31 December 2007: 165 million, is excluded as this is more appropriately classi ed as mutual fund business.

Page 310 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 11 Sensitivity tests The tables below show the sensitivity of the MCEV, value of in-force business at 31 December 2008 and the value of new business for the year ended 31 December 2008 to changes in key assumptions.
Note that no sensitivity results are shown for the Rest of Africa from a materiality perspective.
For each sensitivity illustrated all other assumptions have been left unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised conditions.
Sensitivity scenarios therefore include consistent changes in cash ows directly affected by the changed assumption s, for example future bonus participation in changed economic scenarios.
In some jurisdictions the reserving basis that underlies shareholder distributable cash ows is dynamic, and in theory some sensitivities could change not only future experience but also reserving levels.
Modelling of dynamic reserves is extremely complex and the effect on value is second-order.
Therefore, in performing the sensitivities, reserving bases have been kept constant whilst only varying future experience assumptions with similar considerations applying to required capital.
However the sensitivities for South Africa in respect of an increase decrease of all pre-tax investment and economic assumptions and an increase decrease in equity and property market values allow for the change in the time value of financial options and guarantees that form part of the investment guarantee reserves.
The sensitivities for an increase decrease in all pre-tax investment and economic assumptions with credited rates and discount rates changing commensurately are calculated in line with a parallel shift in risk free reference spot rates rather than risk free reference forward rates.
However, the 1 percent reduction is limited so that it does not lead to negative risk free reference rates.
The equity and property sensitivities make allowance for rebalancing of asset portfolios.
VNB sensitivities assume that the scenario arises immediately after point of sale of the contract.
Therefore no allowance is made for the ability to re-price any contracts in the sensitivity scenarios, apart from the mortality sensitivities for the South African business where allowance is made for changes in the pricing basis for products with reviewable premiums.

Under MCEV a bottom-up allowance is made for financial risks in particular asset and liability cash ows are valued using risk discount rates consistent with those applied to similar cash ows in the capital markets and financial options and guarantees are valued using market consistent models calibrated to observable market prices and an explicit allowance is made for the cost of residual non-hedgeable risks in the covered business.
A summary of the key changes arising in the move from the EEV to MCEV reporting framework previously adopted is set out in the table below.

15 Restatement of Embedded Value of covered business The tables below reconcile the Embedded Value of the covered business as at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 from the previously published EEV basis to the MCEV basis.
The transition from the top-down real-world EEV approach to the bottom-up MCEV approach can be broken down into the following key steps: a.
Release of cost of required capital in published EEV The cost of required capital under the previous EEV approach is released and this component of EEV is replaced by frictional costs see step c under the MCEV approach.
This step increases the Embedded Value.
Economic assumption changes incorporate a combination of the following: Any risk margins in the single weighted average EEV discount rate for each of the geographies are removed and the EEV discount rates are replaced by term dependent risk free reference rates.
This step increases the Embedded Value for pro table business as expected future pro ts are discounted at lower rates, and gives rise to a greater Embedded Value loss for loss making business, as a result of discounting losses at lower rates.
Any risk margins in real-world EEV investment return assumptions are removed and the real-world EEV investment return assumptions are replaced by term dependent risk free reference rates and thereby removing any capitalisation of investment risk margins.
This step decreases the Embedded Value as expected future investment returns are projected at lower rates.
Other related model re nements including updating all stochastic models to be market consistent.
For the United States business such model re nements also include a revision of assumptions for dynamic policyholder behaviour within the stochastic models to allow for lower average returns from risk-neutral market consistent scenarios compared to the scenarios in the real-world stochastic model that was used under EEV.
c. Allowance for frictional costs As mentioned in step a above, the cost of required capital under the previous EEV approach is released and replaced by an allowance for frictional costs under the MCEV approach.
This step decreases the Embedded Value.
d. Explicit allowance for cost of residual non-hedgeable risks Previously under the EEV approach an implicit allowance was permitted for such risks in the determination of the risk discount rate for each geography.

The impact as at 31 December 2007 of moving from an EEV to an MCEV methodology is a reduction in Embedded Value of the covered business of 7.5 percent 31 December 2006: 4.2 percent from 6,861 million to 6,349 million 31 December 2006: from 6,413 million to 6,145 million.
Most of the reduction in Embedded Value is attributable to the United States business which decreased by -56.8 percent at 31 December 2007 31 December 2006: -27.9 percent from 1,069 million to 462 million 31 December 2006: from 1,144 million to 825 million.
The frictional costs calculated under MCEV are signi cantly less than the cost of required capital under EEV which re ects the difference between the risk discount rate in each geography, inclusive of an explicit risk margin, and the expected post-tax investment return on the assets backing the required capital.
Under MCEV risks are modelled explicitly and the risk margin in each geography is not required.
The impact of the transition from EEV to MCEV also varies by product type.
Under EEV a weighted average risk discount rate was applied to all products within a speci c geography whereas under MCEV separate explicit allowances are made for financial and nonfinancial risks for each product.
Risk products, for example term assurance, generally increase in value under MCEV compared to EEV.
Product pro tability is mainly driven by nonfinancial pricing margins which are discounted at lower risk free reference rates under MCEV.
The impact on savings products, for example unit-linked policies, is broadly neutral as the reduced assumed future investment returns which are set in relation to risk free reference rates are largely offset by the increase in value due to the lower discount rates which are also set in relation to risk free reference rates that are applied to future cash ows.
Products with a high proportion of financial risk, for example spread-based contracts such as immediate annuities where pro tability relies on achieving a return in excess of the risk free reference rates to support the pricing bases, tend to reduce in value under MCEV.
No risk premiums in excess of the risk free reference rates are recognised under MCEV until realised in a particular year, when it emerges as a combination of expected existing business contribution and economic variance in that year.
In contrast EEV recognises the capitalised expected pro ts from taking on financial risk, i. e. capitalises returns on more risky assets, without necessarily making appropriate adjustments at a per product level for the fact that the returns under these assets have a greater degree of inherent risk.
Further commentary on the impact of moving from an EEV to an MCEV methodology for each geography, in particular for United States business, is provided below.
Europe and Africa Within the European and African businesses, the aggregate allowance for risk within the EEV and MCEV approaches is broadly aligned and hence relatively minor impacts are experienced on these businesses when moving from an EEV to an MCEV approach for valuing the covered business.
United States The aggregate allowance for risk under EEV was not aligned with the requirements under the new MCEV Principles and the major contributors are discussed below.
Treatment of unrealised corporate bond losses Under EEV any incr ease in credit spreads has a limited impact on Embedded Value as only the assets backing the adjusted net worth, which in the past were largely cash assets, are marked to market.
This methodology is largely driven by the book-value accounting basis used for statutory reporting in the United States.
Therefore on existing assets the only losses capitalised following an increase in credit spreads would be on realised losses on projected sale of assets.
The EEV is only reduced to the extent that the losses realised in the projections are not passed on to policyholders by reducing future crediting bonus rates subject to contractual guarantees and competitive considerations that impact on policyholder persistency behaviour over the remaining lifetime of the in-force policies.
For new bond purchases credit is taken from the increased spread which is recognised as higher expected future income within VIF, offsetting some of the losses on existing assets.
Page 322 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 15 Restatement of Embedded Value of covered business continued However under MCEV all assets ar e marked-to-market and any increase in credit spreads will be fully recognised in the value of the asset portfolio.
Since investment return assumptions are set with reference to swap rates under MCEV, in the modelling of future liability cash ows such losses can not necessarily be passed onto policyholders through changes in future crediting bonus rates, which are subject to contractual guarantees and constrained by competitive considerations, over the remaining lifetime of the in-force policies.
Pricing basis vs. MCEV basis Many of the United States Life pr oducts are priced on the basis that a part of the spread between risk free or swap rates and corporate bonds will be passed onto policyholders in the form of better crediting bonus rates.
The spread of corporate bond yields over risk free rates is assumed to consist of both a credit default component and a non-credit component.
The credit default component compensates the holder of the instrument for the risk that the issuer may default.
The non-credit related component, generally referred to as the liquidity premium, compensates the holder of the instrument for the fact that they may not be able to trade out of the instrument at their choosing.
For many of the pr oducts sold by the US business, pro tability therefore depends on the spread, over risk free rates, earned on corporate bond assets.
For such spread-based business, there is no recognition in the MCEV at 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2006 of any liquidity or credit risk premiums in excess of risk free reference rates until such pro ts have been realised.
The earnings from corporate bond spreads in excess of the risk free reference rates, which had previously been capitalised at point of sale under EEV, are now only recognised as an additional source of earnings in each future time period as the margin over risk free reference rates is earned.
Hence the timing of recognition of pro ts under EEV and MCEV for such business is materially different.
A similar issue occurs with the deferr ed tax assets currently held.
As earnings are expected to emerge over time, it is anticipated that these assets could be utilised to offset future tax liabilities.
However since in the current economic environment taxable pro ts are not projected in aggregate on an MCEV basis, these deferred tax assets are not recognised in the MCEV.
Hence it is expected that the bene t of this asset will emerge over future periods as returns in excess of risk free reference rates are earned.
It is important to appr eciate that the change in reporting basis does not change the underlying pro tability of spread-based business, but merely the representation of pro tability, particularly early in the life of such contracts.
Financial guarantees T o expand further on why the impact of the move to MCEV reporting is so marked on spread-based business, crediting bonus rates are generally set with anticipation of earning some risk premiums over and above the risk free reference rates.
However this non-recognition of projected investment risk premiums under MCEV reporting can not necessarily be offset by reduced policyholder crediting rates as, once these crediting rates are locked in or guaranteed over a future period, they must be valued at that level.
For example, for annuities in payment claim payments are locked in for the duration of the contract at a level which was priced taking into account the expected future corporate bond spreads to be earned.
Hence an initial loss will be shown under MCEV as the annuity payments are larger than can be supported by risk free reference returns on the asset portfolio on a prospective basis, and the Embedded Value valuation assumes that none of these future margins are earned.
For other spr ead-based products such as xed indexed annuities where there is an accumulation phase, the loss of capitalised risk premiums upfront can be partially offset to the extent that crediting bonus rates are not xed for the full term of the contract and that management can adjust future crediting rates relative to modelled investment returns generally aiming to target a margin to cover pro t and expenses.
However future investment returns based on risk free reference rates are much lower than expected real-world returns, which means that any underlying guarantees in the policies including any crediting rates that have been declared prospectively until the next reset date are more likely to take effect in risk-neutral market consistent stochastic scenarios.
There may thus be a shortfall of projected pro ts relative to pro ts that are expected to emerge on a real world pricing basis, which we refer to as spread compression.
Additionally some of the deferred annuities still have crediting rates locked in for several years e. g. Multi-Year Guaranteed Annuities.
Market volatility assumptions that ar e used to calculate the time value of financial options and guarantees under MCEV are higher than the long-term expected volatilities assumed under EEV.
This has increased the time value of financial options and guarantees under MCEV.
Discounting of projected MCEV losses Under MCEV r eporting the discount rate is set in relation to risk free reference rates which are lower than the risk discount rates used under EEV reporting.
In the instance where low risk free projected investment returns under MCEV lead to lower investment income, but overall still re ect pro table products, the discounting effect of using a lower rate tends to offset the removal of the risk premium in investment returns.
However in instances where low risk free projected investment returns under MCEV lead to a projected loss on the business, the resulting losses are also discounted at a lower rate, which has the effect of increasing the present value of the projected future losses.
As a consequence, MCEV r esults at a time of very low risk free reference rates of return need to be carefully considered: An increase in risk free yields can rapidly turn a market consistent VIF that is negative into a positive VIF if the risk free reference rate starts at a level below guaranteed crediting bonus rates and increases to one which leads to a surplus in investment income relative to crediting rates.
In the event that an incr ease in risk free reference rates does not fully cover the required guaranteed crediting rate, the resulting loss will still be smaller than the starting point, and the effect of discounting this at a higher rate could be that the VIF loss reduces substantially.
There is hence a severely non-linear outcome when risk free reference rates are close to guaranteed crediting rates, with small changes in risk free rates up or down leading to large changes in VIF.

Or practically, it is assumed that at 31 December 2007 a larger portion of corporate bond assets will default before maturity than assumed at 31 December 2006.
Reductions in risk free reference rates and as a consequence all guarantees being in the money to a greater extent.
An increase in implied market volatilities which are used to assess the time value of financial options and guarantees, relative to the real-world approach of using historic volatilities that was previously adopted under EEV.
In conclusion, compared to EEV reporting, MCEV reporting merely changes the timing of recognition of pro ts and not the ultimate pro tability that will emerge on covered business.
Over time it is therefore expected that risk premiums in excess of risk free reference rates will be realised and will contribute to MCEV earnings.
16 Comparison of components of Embedded Value on EEV and MCEV bases The tables below provide a comparison of the components of Embedded Value of the covered business as at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 between the previously published EEV basis and the MCEV basis.
The change in MCEV to a bottom-up evaluation of the risks inherent in the business requires a change in the presentation of the components underlying the MCEV.
For the South African business, the value of the asset related to the deferred CGT liability recognised in the adjusted net worth was recalculated on a market consistent basis.

The same steps have been applied in the reconciliations as for the total in-force covered business as set out in note 15.
The impact on VNB of the covered business written in 2007 due to moving from an EEV to MCEV basis is a decrease of 13.6 percent from 266 million to 230 million.
Most of the reduction is attributable to the United States business where VNB decreased by 56.9 percent from 72 million to 31 million.
The EEV risk discount rate for each geography was calibrated for total in-force business and hence the EEV methodology did not make allowance for different levels of risk for different portfolios of asset and liability risks.
The MCEV methodology makes a more granular allowance for the differences in the risk pro le of different product lines and different generations of policies.
The relative impacts on VNB of each of the steps outlined above therefore differ from the impacts on VIF as outlined in note 15 because the risk pro les of new business are different to the risk pro les of in-force business.
Also note that in calculating PVNBP, the projected premiums are discounted with risk free reference rates under MCEV rather the higher risk discount rate which is applicable in each geography under the previous EEV methodology.
PVNBP under MCEV reporting is therefore greater than under EEV reporting with a corresponding decrease in PVNBP margins assuming all other things including VNB being equal.
Page 326 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 18 Restatement of Return on Embedded Value of covered business Return on Embedded Value RoEV for covered business is calculated as the operating earnings after tax divided by opening Embedded Value in local currency.
The table below provides summaries of the drivers in the change of RoEV for the year ended 2007 from the previously published EEV basis to the MCEV basis.
For this purpose the impact on RoEV of the recalibration of risk margins under EEV has been treated as an assumption change.
No results are shown for the Rest of Africa from a materiality perspective.

The impact on VNB as a result of moving from an EEV to MCEV basis has been outlined in note 17.
Other key drivers of the change in RoEV for each geography are discussed below.
UK and ELAM As mentioned earlier in note 12, contrary to previous EEV treatment, the impact of changes in taxation under MCEV is excluded from operating earnings.
Such reallocation of tax changes to non-operating variances is the major reason for the signi cantly reduced contribution of assumption changes.
Nordic The contribution from assumptions changes is impacted positively by treating the negative impact of the recalibration of risk margins under EEV as an assumption change.
In addition the impact from the introduction of annuitisation of the corporate business is higher under MCEV than under EEV since the MCEV effects are discounted at risk free reference rates rather than the higher risk discount rate under EEV.
South Africa The major reasons for the change in RoEV from an EEV to MCEV basis is the signi cantly higher expected existing business contribution.
As mentioned earlier in note 3, the expected existing business contribution under MCEV is now derived with reference to the one-year forward risk free reference rate at the start of the reporting period as opposed to the 10-year government bond yield curve.
The downwards sloping swap yield curve in South Africa therefore leads to a higher expected existing business contribution under MCEV.
United States The positive impact of model improvements and changes in methodology on an MCEV basis has been re-classi ed from assumption changes to other operating variances.
Going forward, rates of return on Embedded Value for the US should be higher than under EEV as the opening MCEV is starting from a much lower base value compared to EEV and, other things being equal, higher actual operating earnings will emerge than projected under MCEV at the valuation date as corporate bond credit spreads are realised and margins such as the cost of residual non-hedgeable risks are released.
