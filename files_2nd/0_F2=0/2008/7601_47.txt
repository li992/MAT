POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS Pensions Within the UK, the Group operates a funded defined benefit plan with benefits linked to final salary and a defined contribution plan.
With effect from 31 December 2002, the defined benefit plan was closed to new UK employees who are offered membership of the defined contribution plan.
The majority of UK employees are members of one of these arrangements.
During the year, the trustees of the scheme, with the support of the Company, purchased an annuity policy in relation to the active members of the scheme.
The effect of this is recognised in actuarial gains losses on plan assets in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The majority of the Schemes benefits are now covered by insurance policies, meaning that pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated, however the obligation ultimately rests with the Group.
A valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme is produced and updated annually to 31 December by independent qualified actuaries.
The main assumptions used for IAS 19 purposes at 31 December were: 2008 2007 Annual rates Rate of increase in salaries 4.9% 5.5% Rate of increase in pensions 2.9% 3.2%3.5% Discount rate 6.4% 5.7%6.3% Inflation 2.9% 3.2%3.5% The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality.
The mortality table implies that a 65 year old male currently has an expected future lifetime of 23.8 years 2007 23.7 years and an expected future lifetime of 26.9 years 2007 26.8 years for a male reaching 65 in 20 years time.
Based upon past experience, pension increases have been assumed to be in line with inflation.
Long term rates of return expected at 31 December: 2008 2007 Annual rates Insurance annuity policies 6.4% 5.7%-6.3% Equities 7.6% 7.6% Bonds 4.1% 4.5% Other 3.8% 5.7% The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined as managements best estimate of the long term return on the major asset classes insurance annuity policies, equities, bonds and other weighted by the actual allocation of assets at the measurement date.
The expected rate of return on the insurance policies has been set equal to the discount rate.
Other information The defined contribution section of the Scheme held assets, equal to its liabilities, of 1.9m as at 31 December 2008.

POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued Scheme assets The proportions of the total assets in the defined benefit section of the Scheme for each asset class and the contributions made were: 2008 2007 Insurance annuity policies 89% 66% Equities 3% 5% Bonds 7% 27% Other 1% 2% 100% 100% Employer contributions made during year m 2.0 7.6 During the year to 31 December 2008, contributions by the Group of 0.6m 2007 0.2m were also made to the defined contribution section of the Scheme.
The 2007 Company contribution to the Scheme included an amount of 5.6m, which was a planned additional payment intended to bring the funding level of the Scheme towards the buy out level.
These ceased in 2008 as the majority of Scheme benefits have been covered with insurance company annuity policies.
For 2009, the Group will pay estimated contributions of 2.0m to the defined benefit section of the Scheme.
Contributions to the defined contribution section of the Scheme are in addition.

Movements in the schemes obligations and assets after that date are therefore not included in the above tables.
For 2008 the actual return on the plans assets amounted to a loss of 23.7m 2007 0.1m.
The loss arising as a result of the reduction of the value placed on the insurance annuity policies is offset by a corresponding reduction in the value placed on the corresponding liabilities.
The effect is seen in the actuarial gains losses on the defined benefit obligations stated above.
