GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PREPARATION the consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with international Financial Reporting standards iFRs as adopted by the european Union.
the financial information has also been prepared under the historical cost convention except that it has been modified to include certain financial assets and liabilities including derivatives at their fair value through the income statement.
pV crystalox solar pLc is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 were approved by the Board of directors on 25 March 2009.
FUNCTIONAL ANd PRESENTATIONAL CURRENCY the financial information has been presented in euros, which is the presentational currency.
All financial information presented has been rounded to the nearest thousand.
the functional currency of the parent company is sterling.
USE OF ESTIMATES ANd JUdGEMENTS the preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted iFRs requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and contingent liabilities.
estimates and assumptions mainly relate to the useful life of noncurrent assets, the discounted cash flows used in impairment testing and the establishing of provisions for litigation, pensions and other benefits, taxes, inventory valuations and guarantees.
estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual values may vary from the estimates.
the estimates and the assumptions are under continuous review with particular attention paid to the life of material plant.
critical accounting and valuation policies and methods are those that are both most important to the depiction of the Groups financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and that require the application of subjective and complex judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
the critical accounting policies that we disclose, will not necessarily result in material changes to our financial statements in any given period but rather contain a potential for material change.
the main accounting and valuation policies used by the Group are outlined in the following notes.
While not all of the significant accounting policies require subjective or complex judgements, the Group considers that the following accounting policies should be considered critical accounting policies.
property, plant and equipment are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
the estimated useful lives are based on estimates of the period during which the assets will generate revenue.
the carrying amount of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are subject to regular impairment testing and are reviewed annually and upon indication of impairment.
A full impairment review has been carried out on all the assets of pV crystalox solar silicon GmbH and no adjustment was necessary.
Although we believe that our estimates of the relevant expected useful lives, our assumptions concerning the business environment and developments in our industry and our estimations of the discounted future cash flows, are appropriate, changes in assumptions or circumstances could require changes in the analysis.
this could lead to additional impairment charges or allowances in the future or to valuation write backs should the expected trends reverse.
the Group is currently using 68 ingot production systems, with a historical cost of 12.5 million, which are fully depreciated.
to compute provisions for taxes, estimates have to be applied.
these estimates involve assessing the probability that deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised to offset taxable income.
the defined benefit plans are partly unfunded and partly funded through pension insurance contracts.
statistical and actuarial methods are used to anticipate future events in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to the plans.
these calculations include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future pension increases.
statistical information such as withdrawal and mortality rates is also used in estimating the expenses and liabilities under the plans.
Because of changing market and economic conditions, the expenses and liabilities actually arising from these plans in the future may differ materially from the estimates made on the basis of these actuarial assumptions.

GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED BASIS OF CONSOLIdATION the Group financial statements consolidate those of the Group and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December 2008. subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
the Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
the results of any subsidiary sold or acquired are included in the Group income statement up to, or from, the date control passes.
Unrealised gains and losses on intragroup transactions are eliminated fully on consolidation.
consolidation is conducted by eliminating the investment in the subsidiary with the parents share of the net equity of the subsidiary.
the Group owns 100% of the voting rights in pV crystalox solar Kabushiki Kaisha.
Minority interests in equity of 43,400 are related to nonredeemable preferred stock, subject to a guaranteed annual dividend payment of 2,000.
As the fair value of the resulting dividend liabilities reduces the equity portion to marginal amounts, all minority interest has been reclassified as liabilities.
on acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiarys separable, identifiable assets and liabilities existing at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair value reflecting their condition at that date.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
so far no acquisitions have taken place since inception of the Group.
Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
All intergroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated upon consolidation.
on 5 January 2007, pV crystalox solar pLc became the legal parent company of pV crystalox solar AG and its subsidiary companies in a share for share transaction.
the former pV crystalox solar AG shareholders became the shareholders of pV crystalox solar pLc.
Following the transaction the Groups continuing operations and executive management were those of pV crystalox solar AG.
Accordingly, the substance of the combination was that pV crystalox solar AG acquired pV crystalox solar pLc in a reverse acquisition.

iAs 32 Financial instruments: presentation has been amended to provide details of the disclosure required when investments in associates and jointly controlled entities are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
the amended standard has to be applied to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. the Group does not believe that the application of this interpretation will have a material impact on the Groups financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Amendment to iAs 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement eligible Hedged items effective 1 July 2009 this amendment clarifies the possibility of movement into and out of the fair value through profit or loss category where a derivative commences or ceases to qualify as a hedging instrument in cash flow or net investment hedge.
the Group will apply the iAs 39 amendment from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the eU, however, it is not expected to have an impact in the Group or companys income statement.
iFRs 7 Amendment to iFRs 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures improving Disclosures About Financial instruments effective 1 January 2009. the amendments aim to explain more clearly how entities determine the fair value of their financial instruments and improve the disclosure of liquidity risk.

iFRic 16 Hedges of Net investment in Foreign operation effective 1 october 2008. this interpretation provides guidance on where, within a group, hedging instruments that are hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation can be held to qualify for hedge accounting.
the Group is not expecting any impact on its financial position, results of operations or cashflows.
iFRic 17 Distribution of Noncash Assets to owners effective 1 July 2009. this interpretation provides guidance on the treatment of distributions of assets other than cash to its shareholders as dividends.
the Group is not expecting any impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
FINANCING STRATEGY ANd CAPITAL STRUCTURE We define capital as equity plus cash and our financial strategy in the medium term is to manage a level of debt that balances the risks of the business with optimising the return on equity by the use of gearing.
the Group is currently cash positive following our ipo in June 2007, although these funds will be mainly utilised for capital investment in the planned polysilicon plant and in the expansion of our existing business.
the only significant borrowings in the Group are in Japan and we take advantage of the relatively low Japanese Yen interest rate to finance our business in Japan.
these borrowings have attached covenants and are secured against our Japanese Yen receivables book.
the terms of the covenants have been and will continue to be adhered to.
the Japanese receivables book and our ongoing sales in Japanese Yen will continue to generate a strong forward cash inflow and accordingly we are not carrying exchange rate risk in respect of these borrowings.
the weighted average rate of interest in 2008 was 1.1% 2007: 1.5% and our gearing ratio was 6% 2007: 21%.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS intangible assets are capitalised at cost and amortised over a useful life of three to five years.
Amortisation of intangible assets is recorded under Depreciation and amortisation in the income statement.
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised at the costs that were necessary to purchase the licenses and make the software usable.
the capitalised costs are written down using the straightline method over the expected economic life of the patents five years or software three to five years.

GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED INTERNALLY GENERATEd INTANGIBLE ASSETS RESEARCH ANd dEVELOPMENT EXPENdITURE expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognised in the income statement as an expense when incurred.
internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria of iAs 38 intangible Assets.
technical and other uncertainties generally have the effect that such criteria are not met.
However, expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
the expenditure capitalised includes the cost of services and materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
otherwise, development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as occurred.
capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
intangible assets relating to products in development both internally and externally acquired are subject to impairment testing upon indication of impairment.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately to the income statement.
subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefit of the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as it occurs.
only patents have been capitalised as development costs to date, as the future utilisation of other developments is not sufficiently determinable or certain.
PROPERTY, PLANT ANd EQUIPMENT property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition or construction cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
No depreciation is charged during the period of construction.
the cost of own work capitalised is comprised of direct costs of material and manufacturing and directly attributable costs of manufacturing overheads.
interest on funding of self constructed assets is capitalised together with all allowable costs up until the point at which the asset is physically able to operate as intended by management.
the capitalised costs are written down using the straightline method.
the Groups policy is to write off the difference between the cost of property, plant and equipment and its residual value systematically over its estimated useful life.
Reviews of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual productive assets are made annually, taking commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear into account.
the total useful lives range from approximately 25 to 30 years for buildings, five to ten years for plant and equipment, up to ten years for fixtures and fittings and four years for motor vehicles.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date or upon existence of indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
the only asset relating to the Bitterfeld facility that has been depreciated in the period, is the building, over a term of 30 years.
it is anticipated that other categories of asset will commence to be depreciated during 2009 and careful consideration will be given to their estimated useful lives.
the gain or loss arising on disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
IMPAIRMENT the carrying amount of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are subject to impairment testing upon indication of impairment and are reviewed annually.
if any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
the recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs of disposal, and value in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation.
LEASEd ASSETS Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives are spread over the total period of the lease.
the obligations from lease contracts are disclosed among financial obligations.
For the reporting period, no assets were recorded under finance leases.

GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups Balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value net of transaction costs, if changes in value are not charged directly to the income statement.
subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, as follows: Amortised cost b fixed deposits, generally funds held with banks and shortterm borrowings and overdrafts are classified as receivables and loans and held at amortised cost: b longterm loans are held at amortised cost: and b accounts payables are not interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and thereafter at amortised cost under the effective interest method.
Held for trading b derivatives, if any, comprising interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, are classified as held for trading.
they are included at fair value, upon the advice of the local bank.
Loans and receivables b noninterest bearing accounts receivables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently valued at amortised cost, less provisions for impairment.
Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the income statement: and b cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of less than three months.
cash and cash equivalents are valued at their nominal value.
changes in the fair value relating to all these financial instruments are treated as follows: b exchange rate gains and losses and impairments are recognised in the income statement.
All other changes in fair value are taken to reserves.
on disposal of the related asset, the accumulated changes in fair value recorded in reserves are included in the gain or loss recorded in the income statement.
interest and other income resulting from financial assets are recognised in the income statement when receivable, regardless of how the related carrying amount of the financial assets is measured.
INVENTORIES inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Acquisition costs for raw materials usually are determined by the weighted average method.
For finished goods and work in progress, cost of production includes directly attributable costs for material and manufacturing and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overhead expenses including depreciation based on normal levels of activity.
selling expenses and other overhead expenses are excluded.
interest expenses are expensed as incurred and therefore not included.
Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
INCOME TAXES current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences.
Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future.
in addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income.
current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.
37 PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 1.
GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED PUBLIC GRANTS ANd SUBSIdIES As the German operations are located in a region designated for economic development, the Group receives both investment subsidies and investment grants.
Government grants and subsidies relating to capital expenditure are credited to the Deferred income account and are released to the income statement by equal annual installments over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets under other income.
Government grants of a revenue nature, mainly for research and development purposes, are credited to the income statement in the same period as the related expenditure.
All required conditions of these grants have been and will continue to be met.
PROVISIONS provisions are formed where a third party obligation exists, which will lead to a probable future outflow of resources and where this outflow can be reliably estimated.
provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation.
if a provision is not considered necessary because a future outflow of resources is only considered possible and not probable, the corresponding obligations are reported as contingent liabilities.
contingent liabilities are determined at the present value of the expected outflow of resources.
provisions include both provisions and accruals.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES provisions are made for legal disputes where there is an obligation at the balance sheet date, an adverse outcome is probable and associated costs can be estimated reliably.
Where no obligation is present at the balance sheet date no provision is made, although the contingent liability will be disclosed in a note.
REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party.
Revenues exclude intergroup sales and value added taxes and represent net invoice value less estimated rebates, returns and settlement discounts.
the net invoice value is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied.
the Group has outsourced some elements of production to external companies.
in cases in which the Group retains power of disposal over the product or product element, a sale is only recognised under iFRs when the final product is sold.
the final product is deemed to have been sold when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party.
the Group has two sales segments: silicon products and trading and equipment.
these are defined as follows: the silicon products segment consists of silicon ingots and wafers produced by Group companies and sold to solar cell manufacturers.
this segment is the core business of the Group.
the trading and equipment segment is mainly the sourcing of silicon ingots from a key supplier to the Group and the onwards supply of these ingots to a major customer.
this is done to facilitate these two key relationships and is not a longterm activity of the Group.
in addition, the trading and equipment segment includes a relatively small amount of spare parts manufactured by the Group.
these sales of spare parts are made to customers that operate equipment that had been built by the Group in the past.
the Group no longer supplies crystal growth equipment and accordingly the sale of spare parts is expected to fall over the coming years.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION the consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to euros at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
the revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into euros at the average foreign exchange rates of the year that the transactions occurred in.
transactions of the included entities in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the respective entity at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to euros at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange rate differences arising on transactions are recognised in the income statement.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are stated at fair value are translated to euros at foreign exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined.
exchange gains and losses on shortterm foreign currency borrowings and deposits are shown as such and taken to operating profit.
in the consolidated financial statements exchange rate differences arising on consolidation of the net investments in subsidiaries together with those on relevant foreign currency loans are taken directly to the currency translation adjustment in equity.

GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED INTEREST INCOME ANd EXPENSES Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income and gains, and any gains and losses on hedging instruments.
interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
the interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
SEGMENT REPORTING A business segment is a group of assets and operating activities that provides products or services, which differ in terms of their risks and opportunities from those of other areas of business.
A geographical segment provides products or services within a certain economic environment with risks and opportunities different from those in other economic environments.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS the Group operates a number of pension schemes.
the schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies.
the Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity.
the Group therefore has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in current and prior periods.
the liability recognised in the Balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
the present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of government bonds at the balance sheet date with a ten year maturity, adjusted for additional term to maturity of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited directly to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional to the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
in this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straightline basis over the vesting period.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to pension insurance plans on a contractual basis.
the Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
the contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due.
prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST ACCOUNTING POLICY All assets and liabilities of the eBt have been consolidated in these financial statements as the Group has fide facto control over the trusts net assets as the parent of its sponsoring company.
dEFERREd INCOME As is common practice with the sector, the Group, where appropriate, both seeks to receive deposits from customers in advance of shipment and makes deposits in advance of supplies.
these deposits are held on the balance sheet and matched against revenue cost as appropriate.
Deposits received from customers are not discounted, as the effect is not considered to be material.

GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED SHAREBASEd PAYMENTS the Group has applied the requirements of iFRs 2 sharebased payments.
the Group issues equitysettled equitybased payments to certain employees.
these are measured at their fair value at the date of the grant and are expensed over the vesting period, based, where necessary, on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, and adjusted for any market based conditions.
Grants of shares made during 2008 and 2007 are not subject to performance criteria and were valued at the date of the grant at market value.
During 2008 the Group granted share options to an employee.
the share options granted are subject to performance criteria required for the option to vest and are considered in the method of measuring fair value.
Fair value is measured using the Blackscholes option pricing Model.
charges made to the income statement in respect of sharebased payments are credited to the sharebased payment reserve.
SHAREHOLdERS EQUITY shareholders equity is comprised of the following balances: Share capital is comprised of 416,725,335 ordinary shares of 2 pence each, see note 26.
Share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses of share issue.
Investment in own shares is the Groups shares held by the employee Benefit trust eBt that are held in trust for the benefit of employees.
Sharebased payment reserve is the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of shares already granted or options outstanding relative to the vesting date or option exercise date.
Reverse acquisition reserve is the difference between the value of the assets acquired and the consideration paid by way of a share for share exchange on 5 January 2007.
Retained earnings is the cumulative profit retained by the Group.
Currency translation adjustment represents the differences arising from the currency translation of the net assets in subsidiaries.

COST OF MATERIAL AND SERVICES the cost of materials is attributable to the consumption of silicon, ingots, wafers, chemicals and other consumables as well as the purchase of merchandise.
purchased services are allocated to cost of services.

in readiness for the completion of the polysilicon plant, the Group 2 purchased, in 2007, land with an area of approximately 31,000m in the chemical park at Bitterfeld in Germany.
selling expenses mainly include delivery costs and warranty provisions.
technical consulting and research and development costs relate to the expenditure in connection with silicon wafers and ingots.
Also included are preliminary costs relating to plans for the plant to produce solar silicon feedstock.
in addition to those disclosed above, the Group undertakes considerable research and development in the field of continuous production process optimisation and improvement and adaptation of products to market requirements.
these costs are an integral part of a highly technical production process.

the German corporation tax rate in 2008 and 2007 was 25% plus the solidarity surcharge of 5.5% of corporation tax.
this resulted in an effective corporation tax rate of 26.375%.
the effective trade income tax amounted to 16.67%.
taking into account the deductibility of trade income tax from corporation tax, the total tax rate for the German companies was 38.65%.
the total tax rate of crystalox Limited in the UK was 28%, and the total tax rate in Japan was 42.05%.
these rates are always based on the legal regulations applicable or adopted at the balance sheet date.

on winding up, their rights are restricted to a repayment of the amount paid up and to share in any surplus assets arising.
the ordinary shares have full voting rights.
SHAREBASED PAYMENT PLANS the Group established the pV crystalox solar pLc employee Benefit trust eBt on 18 January 2007, which has acquired, and may in the future acquire, the companys ordinary shares for the benefit of the Groups employees.
on 19 January 2007 75,000 ordinary shares of 1.00 each on 21 May 2007 each ordinary share of 1.00 in the capital of the company was subdivided into 50 ordinary shares of 2 pence each were granted by the eBt at the market price on that date of 26 per share.
these shares were exercised immediately at an exercise price of nil pence.
the total value of the grant was therefore 1,950,000 or 2,281,017. the Group has two share option schemes in operation which are satisfied by grants from the eBt.
PV CRYSTALOX SOLAR PLC LONGTERM INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP this is a longterm incentive scheme under which awards are made to employees consisting of the right to acquire ordinary shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of specified performance conditions at the end of the vesting period which is not less than three years from the date of grant.
Under the scheme two award schemes have been granted.
Performance Share Award PSA A psA is a conditional award of a specified number of ordinary shares which may be acquired for nil consideration.
the psA granted to date have all been initial awards where there is no specified performance condition.
the vesting period of each award is three years from the date of grant and the award must be exercised no later than 42 months following the date of grant.
on 17 December 2007 awards over 2,175,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence were granted to key employees.
on 26 February 2008 awards were granted to employees of 500 shares each over a total of 33,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence.
in the year under review two employees that had been granted an aggregate amount of 150,000 shares of 2 pence each on 17 December 2007 left the Group and in accordance with the rules of the Ltip these grants were cancelled and the shares remain available within the eBt.
Market Value Option MVO A MVo is an option with an exercise price per share equal to the market value of a share on the date of grant.
the vesting period of each award is three years from the date of grant and the award must be exercised no later than ten years following the date of grant.
on 24 November 2008 a MVo over 200,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence each was granted to a senior employee and this option is exercisable from 24 November 2011 at 1.00 per share subject to an agreed performance criteria.
PV CRYSTALOX SOLAR PLC SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN SIP the sip is an employee share scheme approved by HM Revenue and customs in accordance with the provisions of schedule 8 to the Finance Act 2000. on 26 February 2008 awards were granted to UK employees of 500 shares each over a total of 37,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence.
these 37,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence each were transferred from the eBt into the sip.

MVo options are exercisable between three years and ten years after the date of grant, up to December 2018. sip options are exercisable between three and five years after date of grant, up to February 2013. the remaining weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at 31 December 2008 is 2.46 years for psA 2007: 3.46 years, 9.99 years for MVo and 4.16 years for sip.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND HEDGING STRATEGIES the main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risks, interest rate risks, procurement risks and exchange rate fluctuation risks.
the Board reviews and determines policies for managing each of these risks and are, as such, summarised below.
these policies have been consistently applied throughout the period.
CREdIT RISK the main credit risk arises from accounts receivable.
All trade receivables are of a shortterm nature, with maximum payment terms of 150 days.
in order to manage credit risk, local management defines limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and customer reputation.
credit limits are reviewed by local management on a regular basis.
As a supplier to some of the leading manufacturers of solar cells, the Group has a limited number of customers.
in 2008 36.8% of the sales are related to the largest customer 2007: 48%.
the number of customers accounting for approximately 95% of the annual revenue decreased from 16 in 2007 to 10 in 2008.
Where appropriate, the Group requests payment or part payment in advance of shipment, which generally covers the cost of the goods.
Different forms of retention of title are used for security depending on local restrictions prevalent on the respective markets.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND HEDGING STRATEGIES CONTINUED EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATION RISKS A large portion of sales revenue is invoiced in foreign currencies, potentially exposing the Group to exchange rate risks.
in the financial year 2008, about 154.6 million 2007: 163.5 million of the Groups sales was generated in Japanese Yen.
expenses of 92.9 million 2007: 125.2 million invoiced in Japanese Yen were allocated to cost of materials.
significant cash funds are denominated in currencies other than the presentational currency of the Group.
excess cash funds not needed for local sourcing are exposed to exchange rate and associated interest fluctuation risks, particularly so in the UK.
the exchange rate risk is predominantly based on assets held in currencies other than euros.
the Group sells its products in a number of currencies mainly Japanese Yen and euros and to a lesser extent Us Dollars and also purchases in a number of currencies mainly Japanese Yen, euros, sterling and Us Dollars.
the Group is largely naturally hedged at an operating level because it buys a significant proportion of its raw materials in Japanese Yen and euros, operates its wafering factory within the euro zone and pays for the sub contracting of wafer production in Japan in Japanese Yen.
However, the ingot manufacturing operation is within the UK and therefore a part of Group costs are in sterling.
in addition, the Group has a large debtor book in Japan denominated in Japanese Yen and this is subjected to exchange rate fluctuation of that currency.
the Group is endeavouring to increase its Japanese Yen borrowings to hedge against downwards movement in the Japanese Yen euro exchange rate.
After careful consideration and due to the satisfactory natural operating hedging position coupled with its policy to increase borrowings in Japanese Yen, the directors have adopted a longterm policy of setting off any downside risks of currency fluctuation against the associated upside risks.
During 2008 the Japanese Yen euro exchange rate increased 22.97% 2007: declined 5.22%.
the impact of this increase on the income statement was to increase sales revenues by approximately 16% 2007: decrease 4% and to increase operating profit eBit by approximately 6% 2007: decrease 0.8%.
the relatively high profit margins achieved during 2008 were exacerbated by the effect of the strength of the Japanese Yen.
For each 1% movement in the Japanese Yen euro exchange rate profits would increase decrease by approximately 620k.
the effect of the movement in the Japanese Yen euro exchange rate on assets held in Japanese Yen has been considered, although Group management is seeking to increase borrowings in Japanese Yen so that these largely offset asset balances held in that currency.
However, based on Japanese Yen asset balances on 31 December 2008, each 1% movement in the Japanese Yen euro exchange rate would increase decrease the currency translation adjustment by approximately 320,000.
During 2008 the net gain on foreign currency adjustments was a gain of 38.2 million 2007: gain of 1.9 million.
this gain was largely related to differences between the rate at which sales were booked and the rate on the date that the related currency was received.
the remainder of the currency gain related to the conversion of currency balances in respect of Group loans, currency debtor creditor balances and currency advance payments to feedstock suppliers.
these can be broken down into the following broad categories: million Revaluation of cash balances 16.9 Revaluation of Group loan in Japanese Yen 11.3 Debtor creditor revaluation 0.4 Revaluation of suppliers deposits 7.7 TOTAL CURRENCY GAIN 36.3 in line with the Groups natural hedging, upon translation of net assets in the consolidation, there was a negative impact in 2008 of 32.3 million recording as a currency translation adjustment.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND HEDGING STRATEGIES CONTINUED EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATION RISKS CONTINUEd INTEREST FLUCTUATION RISKS the Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risks, since the Groups loan agreements largely are subject to variable interest rates.
in the past, in Japan, swaps have been used to a small extent to hedge against these risks, although these have now been eliminated.
All variable interest rate loans are of a shortterm nature with a maturity of less than twelve months and part of credit lines that expire at the latest in september 2009. the vast majority of borrowings 15.696 million 99.96% at the end of 2008 are in Japanese Yen 2007: 99.8%.
Accordingly, there is a downside risk that Japanese Yen interest rates may increase substantially from the current low levels.
However, the Group has a regular strong Japanese Yen income, sufficient to repay the loans if Group management wished to do so within a twelve month time scale.
on 31 December 2008 the Group had borrowings in Japanese Yen of 15.7 million 2007: 39.5 million at an average interest rate of approximately 1.135% 2007: 1.5%.
For each 1% rise in the Japanese Yen interest rates Group interest costs would increase by approximately 160,000 2007: 400,000 and for each 1% fall in the Japanese Yen interest rates interest costs would fall by approximately 160,000 2007: 400,000.
Accordingly, Group profits and equity would fall or rise after corporation tax in Japan by approximately 80,000 2007: 200,000.
Further sensitivity analysis of the accruals and loans outstanding at the year end has not been disclosed as these are virtually all current and paid in line with standard payment terms.
the Groups borrowings in Japanese Yen are also current and have no set repayment plan being secured on the Japanese receivables book.
the interests on this loan is paid monthly in arrears.
