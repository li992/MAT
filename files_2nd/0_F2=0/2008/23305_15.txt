ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and the AIC Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Investment Trusts dated January 2003 and revised in December 2005. a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted.
b Income Income from equity investments is credited to the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Interest receivable on fixed interest securities is accounted for on an accruals basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate on the security.
Franked dividends are accounted for net of any tax credit.
Unfranked investment income includes tax deducted at source.
Interest receivable on short term loans and deposits is dealt with on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
The premium received on covered call options is taken to income over the life of the contracts where the strike of the option is greater than the price of the underlying security at the time of trade.
c Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a capital receipt or a revenue receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Long term borrowings Long term borrowings are carried in the Balance Sheet at the cumulative amount of net proceeds on issue plus accrued finance costs.
Finance costs include the difference between the repayable value on maturity and the proceeds received on issue which are written off on an effective interest rate basis over the life of the borrowings.
Gains and losses on the repurchase or early settlement of debt are wholly charged to capital.
e Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement with the exception of the investment management fee and debenture interest.
Expenses are charged to capital where they are incurred in connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments.
In this respect the investment management fee and relevant finance costs are allocated between revenue and capital in line with the Boards expectation of returns from the Companys investments over the long term in the form of revenue and capital respectively.
Since April 2000, the Company has allocated 70% of management fee and debenture interest to capital and 30% to revenue costs.
In accordance with the SORP the Board has reviewed this policy and, having examined consensus forecasts of capital return and dividend payments, sees no need to change the existing policy at this time.
f Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
g Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserves - realised and unrealised.
h Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors and other key personnel.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost and subsequently, the investments are valued at fair value, which is measured as follows: Listed investments are valued at bid prices, where the bid price is available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations: Unlisted investments where there is not an active market are valued using an appropriate valuation technique so as to establish what the transaction price would have been at the balance sheet date.
Page 34 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements Transaction costs Financial Reporting Standard 26 FRS26 : Financial Instruments: Measurement requires that the cost of purchasing investments be recognised and accounted for as a separate item from investment gains.
However, in accordance with the AIC SORP the Company includes these costs in the cost of investments purchased and has disclosed them in note 9. i Capital reserve-realised Gains and losses on the realisation of investments, changes in fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms, and realised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - realised.
Purchases of the Companys own shares for cancellation are also funded from this reserve.
The capital element of the investment management fee and relevant finance costs are charged to this reserve.
Any associated tax relief is credited to this reserve.
Capital reserve-unrealised Changes in the fair value of investments held at the year end that are not readily convertible to cash without accepting adverse terms, and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - unrealised.
j Dividends In accordance with FRS21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date dividends declared and approved by the Company after the balance sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the balance sheet date.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE Investment management fee excluding VAT 3,350 3,521 VAT on investment management fee to 31 October 2007 see overleaf 358 616 Investment management fee including VAT 3,708 4,137 Charged against capital reserve realised see note 14 2,596 2,896 Charged against revenue 1,112 1,241 The investment management fee is 0.26% per annum of the total assets of the Company, after deducting current liabilities and excluding commonly managed funds.
The investment management fee is chargeable 30% to revenue and 70% to capital.
The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2008 Page 35 Notes to the Financial Statements With effect from 1 November 2007 management fees have been exempt from VAT charges following the decision of the European Court of Justice in the JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust AIC case C-363 05 which confirmed that the VAT exemption applicable to the management of special investment funds should also extend to investment trust companies.
Therefore investment trust companies are entitled to recover VAT previously charged on such management fees and HM Revenue & Customs has withdrawn its appeal to the VAT tribunal.
There are uncertainties surrounding the recovery process and amounts and therefore no VAT recoveries have been recognised in these financial statements.
It is not certain to what extent the full recovery of VAT will be possible.
The Company is no longer paying VAT on its management fees.

TAXATION ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES a Analysis of charge in year Overseas taxation 276 14 Total current tax for year see note 6b 276 14 Page 36 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements b Factors affecting the taxation charge for the year The taxation assessed for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for an investment trust company of 30% 2007: 30%.
The differences are explained below.
2008 2007 000 000 Revenue return on ordinary activities before taxation 44,050 40,728 Return on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax of 30% 2007: 30% 13,215 12,218 Effects of: Income not subject to corporation taxation 13,539 13,571 Increase in excess management expenses excess loan relationship debits in the revenue account 324 1,353 Overseas taxation 276 14 Current corporation taxation charge Note 6a 276 14 Investment trust companies are exempt from taxation on capital gains if they meet the HM Revenue & Customs criteria set out in s842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 for a given period.
Therefore, any capital return is not included in the above reconciliation.
c Deferred taxation At 31 March 2008, the Company had net surplus management expenses and net surplus losses on loan relationships being the excess of interest payable on the debenture stocks and any other borrowing over interest receivable totalling 227,185,728 2007: 209,854,510 and eligible unrelieved foreign taxation totalling 197,343 2007: 86,464.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these.
This is because the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to reduce future taxation liabilities through the use of existing surplus expenses.

The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 5.65 pence per share, amounting to 11,085,000, which is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The total dividend payable in respect of the year ended 31 March 2008, which is the basis on which the requirements of s842 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are considered, is stated below.

The balances on both reserves at 1 April 2007 have been amended by a reserve transfer to reflect this change.
NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE Total shareholders funds have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of FRS26.
The analysis of total shareholders funds on the face of the balance sheet does not reflect the rights, under the Articles of Association, of the ordinary shareholders on a return of assets.
These rights are reflected in the net asset value and the asset value per share attributable to ordinary shareholders at the year end, adjusted to reflect the deduction of the debenture stocks at par.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Management of risk The investment objectives of the Company are detailed in Objectives and Investment Policy on page 2.
In pursuit of this objective, the Company may be exposed to various forms of risk, as described below and as described on pages 12 to 14 within the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and policy Futures and covered call options held in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and policy Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Debenture stocks The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2008 Page 43 Notes to the Financial Statements The risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market risk which comprises equity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets monthly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objectives.
The Investment Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
The Company has the option to invest up to 200 million of the debenture stocks in the equity market.
In a rising market the Company would benefit, but in a falling market the impact could be severe.
In order to manage the level of gearing, the Investment Manager invests part of the assets available in Fidelity Institutional Cash Fund plc and short term cash deposits.
This controls the level of net gearing.
Long futures positions have been used as a quick and effective means to increase the Companys exposure to the equity market.
There were no transactions in futures during the year 2007: realised capital losses 179,000.
Foreign currency risk Almost all of the financial assets and financial liabilities of the Company are denominated in sterling: therefore the net assets and total return are not significantly affected by currency movements.
Interest rate risk All of the Companys long term debt is fixed rate which exposes the Company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
The debenture stocks in issue provide secure long term funding while short term flexibility is achieved through overdraft facilities.
Information on the debenture stocks is provided in note 12.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities, which can be easily sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Credit risk Counterparty credit risk is not judged to be significant as transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, all transactions are settled on a delivery versus payment basis and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
Investments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited or the Companys custodian suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All security transactions are through brokers which have been approved as an acceptable counterparty.
This is reviewed on an ongoing basis.

Financial liabilities The Company finances its investment activities through its ordinary share capital, reserves and borrowings.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise its debenture stocks and other short term creditors.
The currency cash flow profile of these financial liabilities is shown below.

A 5% weakening of sterling against the US dollar, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2008 Page 45 Notes to the Financial Statements Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The analysis below summarises the extent to which the Companys assets and liabilities are affected by changes in interest rates.

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis At 31 March 2008 if interest rates would have increased by 0.5% the total return on ordinary activities would have increased by 390,000 2007: 70,000.
A decrease in the interest rates by 0.5% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Other price risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
Details of how the Board sets risk parameters and performance objectives can be found on pages 12 to 14 under the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section.
Other price risk sensitivity analysis A full list of the Companys investments is shown on pages 48 and 49.
In addition, a list of the thirty largest investments analysed by industrial sector is shown on page 16.
All of the Companys investments are in quoted equities.
A 3% increase in the market value of these investments at 31 March 2008 would have increased total assets and total return on ordinary activities by 31,939,000 2007: 41,227,000.
A decrease of 3% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Page 46 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements Financial liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March 2008 and 2007 is as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Fair value interest rate risk: After more than five years 196,356 196,105 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the Balance Sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
As explained in note 1 investments are shown at fair value which is bid market price.
In the case of cash, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
The exceptions are the unsecured long term fixed rate debenture stocks, whose fair values as at 31 March 2008, given below, have been calculated on the basis of quoted market prices for the stocks.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL COMMITMENTS There were no contingent liabilities or capital commitments as at 31 March 2008 2007: nil.
TRANSACTIONS WITH THE MANAGER The Directors have complied with the provisions of FRS8 which require disclosure of related party transactions and balances.
Fidelity Investments International is the Manager and Secretary of the Company and details of the services provided and fees paid are given on pages 8 and 25 and note 3 on pages 35 and 36.
