Cambridge Solutions Limited is listed on the Bombay, National, Madras and Ahmedabad stock exchanges.
This will be achieved via agreements reached between Xchanging and the three major shareholders of Cambridge Solutions Limited.
In compliance with Indian law and as a consequence of these agreements, Xchanging are required to make an Open Offer to acquire up to 20% of the fully diluted voting share capital of Cambridge Solutions Limited.
The total proportion of shares to be acquired under the agreements and the Open Offer is 75% of the fully diluted share capital, the proportion of which to be acquired under the agreements will depend on the take up under the Open Offer.
The Open Offer to the public will be open between 25 February 2009 and 16 March 2009, and will complete on 31 March 2009.
The sale of shares under the share purchase agreements is expected to complete on 2 April 2009, the acquisition completion date.
However, pursuant to the terms of the sales and purchase agreements entered into, certain rights are assumed by Xchanging plc in advance of the final completion date.
A number of these rights can be enacted from 1 January 2009, and therefore it is from this date that the power of operational control is considered to have passed, and the date from which Cambridge Solutions Limiteds results will be consolidated by the Group.
David Andrews and Richard Houghton were appointed to the Board of Cambridge Solutions Limited on 12 January 2009.
The total consideration for the acquisition is expected to be approximately 88 million.
The consideration will be settled through the payment of INR 3,712 million in cash estimated as 52 million at the year end exchange rate, and the issue of 15,249,998 Xchanging plc shares estimated as 36 million at the year end share price.
An amount of 25,502,000 has been placed in an escrow account pending completion of the Open Offer and is therefore restricted in its use note 21.
Due to the proximity of the assumption of control in relation to the signing of the year end accounts, the Directors are of the opinion that it is impracticable to provide detailed disclosure in relation to this acquisition.
