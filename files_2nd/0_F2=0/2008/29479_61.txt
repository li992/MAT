The incentive schemes are designed to be retentive in nature as well as linking the value of an award to movements in the share price, in line with shareholder interests.
Based on data provided by Hewitt, approximately 50-55% of the total remuneration of the executive Directors is performance related, except for Mike Wilson, the Chairman, where approximately 40% of his total remuneration is performance related.
The executive Chairman, Mike Wilson, does not participate in the annual bonus scheme.
He does participate in the long term incentive scheme the Performance Share Plan, as this plan focuses on long term value creation rather than the more operationally focussed annual bonus plan.
Any shares in the Company which vest to Mike Wilson will be retained by him until he ceases to be a Director of the Company, less any shares required to meet any tax liability on vesting.
The Committee also operates shareholding guidelines for the executive Directors, whereby as and when awards vest under the Performance Share Plan or other long term incentive schemes, the executive Directors are required to retain no fewer than 50% of the vested shares, less any shares required to pay any tax liability which arises on vesting, until such time as a shareholding equivalent to 100% of base salary has been achieved.
At the year end share price of 1.78, the value of shares in the Company held by the executive Directors as at 31 December 2008, calculated as a percentage of their base salary, is as follows: Director Value as a % of base salary David Bellamy 313% Andrew Croft 159% Ian Gascoigne 236% David Lamb 219% Mike Wilson 1280% Salaries Salaries are reviewed annually in January, using comparative company data provided by Hewitt.
As stated above, the Committee aims to set fixed benefits salary, pension and fringe benefits below the median position for companies of a similar size in the UK financial services market with a cross check with other sectors, with adjustments then being made to take into account the responsibility and accountabilities of each role, the experience of the relevant individual and any other relevant factors.
The Committee reviewed the salaries of the executive Directors in January 2009, but agreed with the recommendation from management that, in light of the decision by management to freeze the salaries of all management grades in 2009 other than for promoted executives, that it would be appropriate to apply the same policy in relation to the pay of the executive Directors.
The Committee approved an increase in David Lambs salary on the basis that he was appointed to the Board recently December 2007 and his salary has been moved closer to but still below the market median in recognition of his performance and development during 2008.
Mike Wilsons base salary has reduced due to his move from 1 January 2009 to working three days per week and has been pro-rated accordingly: Director New salary Previous salary David Bellamy 425,000 425,000 Ian Gascoigne 320,000 320,000 Andrew Croft 320,000 320,000 David Lamb 280,000 250,000 Mike Wilson 315,000 525,000 66 St. Jamess Place plc Report & Accounts 2008
