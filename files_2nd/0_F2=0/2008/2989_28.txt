These contracts are mainly denominated in Euro, South African Rand and US Dollar and primarily cover stock purchases and operating expenses.

Within this balance, 31.3m 2007 6.0m is held in relation to cash flow hedges, for which the associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to the income statement when the transactions occur over the next 12 months.
The remainder of the outstanding currency contracts relates to investments in and loans to the Groups non-Sterling operations.
The amount transferred to income in respect of forward currency contracts was an expense of 3.1m 2007 income of 0.3m which has been offset by the foreign exchange movements of the financial assets that they hedge.
All cashflow hedges will reverse within the next two financial years.

The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including market risk such as currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group Treasury function, which operates under approved treasury policies, uses certain financial instruments to mitigate potentially adverse effects on the Groups financial performance from these risks.
These financial instruments primarily consist of bank loans and deposits, spot and forward foreign exchange contracts, and foreign exchange swaps.
Other products, such as interest rate swaps and currency options, can also be used depending on the risks to be covered.
The Group does not trade or speculate in any financial instruments.
