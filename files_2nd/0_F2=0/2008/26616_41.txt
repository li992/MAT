The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and options awarded granted, excluding the impact of any nonmarket vesting conditions for example, earnings per share and return on equity targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions made on the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
