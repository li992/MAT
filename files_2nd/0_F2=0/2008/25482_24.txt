Ernst & Young LLP Registered auditors London 17 June 2008 Notes: 1.
The maintenance and integrity of the Investec plc web site is the responsibility of the directors: the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the web site.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
2008 Investec Annual Report 207 Financial statements Investec plc and Investec Limited Independent auditors' report to the members of Investec Limited We have audited the group annual financial statements of Investec Limited, which comprise the directors' report, the combined consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2008, the combined consolidated income statement, the combined consolidated statement of total recognised income and expenses and consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes, as set out on pages 197 to 280, the parent company annual financial statements of Investec Limited, which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 March 2008, the income statement, the statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes, as set out on pages 284 to 287 and the information in the risk management report and directors' remuneration report that is marked as audited.
Directors' responsibility for the financial statements The company's directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and in the manner required by the South African Companies Act of 1973.
This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error: selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies: and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.
Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group and the company as of 31 March 2008 and of the financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and in the manner required by the South African Companies Act of 1973.

2008 Investec Annual Report 212 Financial statements Investec plc and Investec Limited Accounting policies Basis of presentation The group financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union EU which comply with the IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
At 31 March 2008, IFRS standards as endorsed by the EU are identical to current IFRSs applicable to the group.
The group financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for investment properties, available for sale investments, derivative financial instruments, financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss, and pension fund surpluses and deficits that have been measured at fair value.
Accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the prior year.
Basis of consolidation Investec consists of two separate legal entities, being Investec plc and Investec Limited, that operate under a dual listed company DLC structure.
The effect of the DLC structure is that Investec plc and its subsidiaries and Investec Limited and its subsidiaries operate together as a single economic entity, with neither assuming a dominant role and accordingly are reported as a single reporting entity under IFRS.
All subsidiaries and special purpose vehicles in which the group holds more than one half of the voting rights or over which it has the ability to control either directly or in substance are consolidated from the effective dates of acquisition that is from when control exists and up to the effective dates of loss of control, except entities which are classified as non-current assets held for sale.
Subsidiaries classified as non-current assets held for sale are consolidated as discontinued operations.
Entities, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the group exercises significant influence over operating and financial policies, are treated as associates.
In the group accounts, associates are accounted for using the equity method from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases, except as noted below.
The combined consolidated financial statements include the attributable share of the results and reserves of associated undertakings.
The group's interests in associated undertakings are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the group's share of net assets of the associate plus goodwill arising on acquisition, less any impairment recognised.
In circumstances where associates or joint venture holdings arise in which the group has no strategic intention, these investments are classified as venture capital holdings and are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
All intergroup balances, transactions and unrealised gains and losses within the group are eliminated to the extent that they do not reflect an impairment to the asset.
Segmental reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the group engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment which is subject to risks and rewards that are distinguishable from those of other segments.
The group's primary segmental reporting is presented in the form of a business analysis primary segment.
The business analysis is presented in terms of the group's five principal business divisions and Group Services and Other Activities.
A geographical analysis is presented in terms of the main geographies in which the group operates representing the group's exposure to various economic environments.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the net excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net identifiable assets of entities acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised and tested for impairment at balance sheet dates or when there is an indication of impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of testing impairment based on the synergies expected in the business combination, with any impairments arising being recognised immediately in the income statement.
Impairments recognised are not reversed in subsequent periods.
In circumstances where the group acquires an interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of the acquisition, the group reassesses the identification and measurement of all assets and liabilities including contingent liabilities following which any remaining excess is recognised immediately in profit and loss.
2008 Investec Annual Report 213 Financial statements Investec plc and Investec Limited Accounting policies Goodwill arising is denominated in the functional currency of the foreign operation and is translated to the presentation currency of the group pound sterling at the applicable closing rate.
Goodwill arising on investment in associates is included within the investment in associates.
Share based payments to employees The group engages in equity settled share based payments and in certain limited circumstances cash-settled share based payments in respect of services received from employees.
The fair value of the services received in respect of equity settled share based payments is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options on the date of grant to the employee.
The cost of the share based payment is recognised over the vesting period of the grant in the income statement on a straight-line basis, based on an estimate of the amount of instruments that will eventually vest.
A liability and expense in respect of cash settled share based payments is recognised over the vesting period of the grant in the income statement on a straight-line basis, based on the fair value of the instrument that will eventually vest.
The liability is recognised at the current fair value at each balance sheet date, based on an estimate of the number of instruments that will eventually vest.
Subsequent to vesting the liability is measured at fair value, with gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account until such time as the liability is settled.
Fair value measurements are based on option pricing models, taking into account the risk-free interest rate, volatility of the underlying equity instrument, expected dividends and current share prices.
Foreign currency transactions and foreign operations The presentation currency of the group is Pound Sterling, being the functional currency of Investec plc.
The functional currency of Investec Limited is South African Rand.
Foreign operations are subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures or branches of the group, the activities of which are based in a functional currency other than that of the reporting entity.
The functional currency of group entities is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
On consolidation, the results and financial position of foreign operations are translated into the presentation currency of the group as follows: Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet: Income and expense items are translated at exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction: All resulting exchange differences are recognised in equity foreign currency translation reserve, which is recognised in profit and loss on disposal of the foreign operation: Cash flow items are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the entity in which the transaction arises based on rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
At each balance sheet date foreign currency items are translated as follows: Foreign currency monetary items other than monetary items that form part of the net investment in a foreign operation are translated using closing rates, with gains and losses recognised in profit and loss: Exchange differences arising on monetary items that form part of the net investment in a foreign operation are determined using closing rates and recognised as a separate component of equity foreign currency translation reserve upon consolidation, and is recognised in the income statement upon disposal of the net investment: Non-monetary items that are measured at historical costs are translated using the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Revenue recognition Interest income is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Fees charged on lending transactions are included in the effective yield calculation to the extent that they form an integral part of the effective interest yield, but excludes those fees earned for a separately identifiable significant act, which are recognised upon completion of the act.
Fees and commissions charged in lieu of interest are recognised as income as part of the effective interest rate on the underlying loan.
2008 Investec Annual Report 214 Financial statements Investec plc and Investec Limited Accounting policies The effective interest method is based on the estimated life of the underlying instrument, and, where this estimate is not readily available, the contractual life.
Commissions and fees include fees earned from providing advisory services as well as portfolio management.
All such commissions and fees are recognised as revenue when the related services are performed.
Fees and commission income are only recognised when they can be estimated reliably.
Principal transaction income includes trading profits, gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities designated as held at fair value and fair value gains and losses on investment properties.
Trading profits are shown net of the funding cost of the underlying positions and includes the unrealised profits on trading portfolios, which are marked to market daily.
Equity investments received in lieu of corporate finance fees are included in trading securities and valued accordingly.
Trading profits gross of funding costs are disclosed in note 4.
Included in other operating income is revenue from consolidated private equity investments.
Operating costs associated with these investments are included in administrative expenses.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are initially recognised at their fair value, plus in the case of financial assets or financial liabilities not at fair value through profit and loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liabilities.
Regular way purchase and sale transactions in respect of financial assets that require delivery of a financial instrument within the time frame established by market convention are recorded at trade date.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit and loss Financial instruments held at fair value through profit and loss include all instruments classified as held for trading and those instruments designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
Financial instruments classified as held for trading or designated as held at fair value through profit and loss are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Financial instruments are classified as trading when they are held with the intention of short-term disposal, held with the intention of generating short-term profits, or are derivatives which are not designated as part of effective hedges.
Financial instruments designated as held at fair value through profit and loss are designated as such on initial recognition of the instrument and remain in this classification until derecognition.
In certain instances debt instruments which contain equity features are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
Financial assets and liabilities are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss only if: It eliminates or significantly reduces an inconsistent measurement or recognition that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases: or A group of financial assets, financial liabilities or both is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the group is provided internally on that basis to the group's key management personnel: and If a contract contains one or more embedded derivatives which significantly modifies the cash flows that would be required by the contract and is not clearly prohibited from separation from the host contract and the group has designated the entire hybrid contract as a financial instrument at fair value through profit and loss.
Held-to-maturity assets Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial instruments with fixed or determinable payments and maturity dates which the group has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
Held-to-maturity assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment losses.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.
The amortisation is included in interest income in the income statement.
The losses arising from impairment of such investments are recognised in the income statement.
2008 Investec Annual Report 215 Financial statements Investec plc and Investec Limited Accounting policies Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and exclude the following: Those that the group intends to trade in, which are classified as held for trading, and those that the group designates as at fair value through profit and loss: Those that the group designates as available for sale: and Those for which the holder may not recover substantially all of its initial investment, other than because of credit deterioration, which are accounted for at fair value through profit and loss.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment losses.
The effective interest rate represents the rate that exactly discounts future projected cash flows, through the expected life of the financial instrument, to the net carrying amount of the financial instrument.
Included in the calculation of the effective interest rate is any discount or premium on acquisition and fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.
Losses arising from impairment of such investments are recognised in the income statement line Impairment losses on loans and advances.
Available for sale assets Available for sale financial assets are those which are designated as such or do not qualify to be classified as designated at fair value through profit and loss, held-to-maturity, or as loans and receivables.
They include strategically held equity instruments that are not associates, joint ventures or subsidiaries of the group.
Furthermore, certain loans and receivables that are held at fair value due to being quoted on an active market, which are neither actively traded nor held to maturity instruments, are classified as available for sale financial assets.
Financial assets classified as available for sale are measured at fair value on the balance sheet, with unrealised gains and losses recognised in equity.
When the asset is disposed of, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Interest earned whilst holding available for sale financial assets is reported as interest income using the effective interest rate.
Dividends earned whilst holding available for sale financial assets are recognised in the income statement when the right of payment has been established.
If an available for sale instrument is determined to be impaired, the respective cumulative unrealised losses previously recognised in equity are included in the income statement in the period in which the impairment is identified.
Impairments on available for sale equity instruments are not reversed once recognised in the income statement.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as non-trading, held for trading or designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
Non-trading liabilities are recorded at amortised cost applying the effective interest method.
Held for trading liabilities or liabilities designated as held at fair value through profit and loss, are measured at fair value.
Valuation of financial instruments All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value.
On initial recognition, the fair value of a financial instrument is the transaction price unless it is determined appropriate that the fair value of a financial instrument is more accurately determined by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument i. e. without modification or repackaging or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets.
In circumstances where unobservable data has a significant impact on the valuation of a financial instrument, the entire difference between the model determined fair value and the transaction price is not recognised on initial recognition.
The difference arising is recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction, or when inputs become observable, or when the transaction is effectively closed out.
Subsequent to initial recognition the following financial instruments are measured at fair value: Fixed maturity securities classified as trading, held at fair value through profit and loss or available for sale, Equity securities, Private equity investments, Derivative positions, Loans and advances designated as held at fair value through profit and loss, Loans and advances designated as available for sale: and Financial liabilities classified as trading or designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
2008 Investec Annual Report 216 Financial statements Investec plc and Investec Limited Accounting policies Subsequent to initial recognition, the fair value of financial instruments quoted in an active market is based on published price quotations.
Where market prices are not available, fair value is determined by discounting the expected cash flows, using market interest rates taking into account the credit quality and duration of the investment.
In certain instances model pricing may be used to determine fair values.
For private equity investments that are not publicly traded, management uses comparisons to similar listed companies, relevant third party arms' length transactions and other data specific to the investment.
Impairments of financial assets held at amortised cost Financial assets carried at amortised cost are impaired if there is objective evidence that the group would not receive cash flows according to the original contractual terms.
Financial assets are assessed for objective evidence of impairment at least at each balance sheet reporting date.
The test for impairment is based either on specific financial assets or collectively on a portfolio of similar, homogeneous assets.
Assets specifically identified as impaired are excluded from the portfolio assessment.
Impairments are credited to an allowance account which is carried against the carrying value of financial assets.
Interest continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount based on the original effective interest rate of the asset.
Loans together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realised or has been transferred to the group.
An allowance for impairment is only reversed when there is objective evidence that the credit quality has improved to the extent that there is reasonable assurance of timely collection of principal and interest in terms of the original contractual agreement.
The impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the expected cash flows including net proceeds on realisation of collateral discounted at the original effective rate.
To cater for any shortfall between regulatory provision requirements in the respective jurisdictions and impairments based on the principles above, a transfer is made from distributable to non distributable reserves, being the regulatory general risk reserve.
The non-distributable regulatory risk reserve ensures that minimum regulatory provisioning requirements are maintained.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or a portion thereof, is derecognised when the group's rights to cash flows has expired: or when the group has transferred its rights to cash flows relating to the financial assets, including the transfer of substantially all the risk and rewards associated with the financial assets or when control over the financial assets has passed.
A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, that is when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expired.
Derivative instruments All derivative instruments of the group are recorded on balance sheet at fair value.
Positive and negative fair values are reported as assets and liabilities respectively and are offset when there is both an intention to settle net and a legal right to offset exists.
Derivative positions are entered into either for trading purposes or as part of the group's asset and liability management activities to manage exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Both realised and unrealised profits and losses arising on derivatives are recognised in the income statement as part of trading income other than circumstances in which cash flow hedging is applied as detailed below.
Hedge accounting The group applies either fair value or cash flow hedge accounting when the transactions meet the specified hedge accounting criteria.
To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the group ensures that all of the following conditions are met: At inception of the hedge the group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument s and hedged item s including the risk management objectives and the strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction.
The hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the originally documented risk management strategy for that particular hedging relationship.
For cash flow hedges, a forecasted transaction that is the subject of the hedge must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit and loss.
The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured, i. e. the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk and the fair value of the hedging instrument can be reliably measured.
The hedge effectiveness is assessed on an ongoing basis and determined actually to have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedge was designated.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when it is determined that the instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge: the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised: when the hedge item matures or is sold or repaid: or when a forecasted transaction is no longer deemed highly probable.
