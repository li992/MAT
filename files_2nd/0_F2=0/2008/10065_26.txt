The additional amounts recognised during the year arose on the acquisition of FKI plc.
Goodwill has been allocated to the business segments, each of which comprises several cash generating units as follows: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 m m Energy 247.2 Lifting 312.1 Dynacast 222.6 164.5 Other Industrial 39.6 3.2 Discontinued 15.8 821.5 183.5 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions have been revised in the year in the light of the current economic environment which has resulted in more conservative estimates about the future.
The Company estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each cash generating unit.
The growth rates are based on a prudent estimate of long term industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
Melrose PLC Annual Report 2008 63 Notes to the accounts continued 12 Intangible assets continued The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent twelve month financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates cash flows based on estimated growth rates of between 2% and 3%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The pre-tax discount rate applied is between 7% and 9% depending on the risk elements associated with each cash generating unit.
Acquisition of subsidiaries On 1 July 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of FKI plc.
FKI plc is the parent company of a group of companies operating in segments described in note 5.

The fair value adjustments to intangible assets relate to the valuation of brand names and customer relationships held within the FKI group deemed separately identifiable and measurable at the date of acquisition.
The fair value adjustment to deferred tax primarily relates to the valuation of the intangibles noted above.
The fair value adjustments to inventories arise primarily on changes to accounting policies as well as additional provisions recognised against net realisable value.
The fair value adjustments to trade and other receivables predominately relate to the write off or provision against doubtful debts as well as a change to accounting policies.
The fair value adjustments to trade and other payables arise on the recognition of identifiable and measurable liabilities at the date of acquisition.
The fair value adjustments to provisions relate primarily to environmental and legal claims acquired.
Melrose PLC Annual Report 2008 64 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS & NOTES 12 Intangible assets continued The fair value adjustment to post retirement benefit obligations arises from aligning the assumptions used in valuing the FKI schemes with Melrose PLCs assumptions.
The goodwill arising on acquisition of the FKI group is attributable to the anticipated profitability and cash flows arising from the businesses acquired.
The shares issued on the acquisition of FKI plc are detailed in note 25.
1 The FKI group contributed 635.8 million revenue and 78.7 million of continuing headline operating profit during the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of 2008, the continuing revenue for the Group would have been 1,533.5 million and headline operating profit from continuing operations would have been 165.0 million.
On 22 August 2008, the Group acquired the trade and assets of Fishercast Global operating in Canada and the UK for consideration of 6.7 million including acquisition costs of 0.4 million.

The Fishercast business contributed 8.9 million revenue and 0.8 million headline operating profit during the period since acquisition.
Disclosure of the revenue and profit of the acquired businesses for the year, as though the acquisition date had occurred at the beginning of the year, is not practical to obtain as not all of the trade and assets were acquired.
The goodwill arising on the above acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the distribution of the Groups products and the anticipated synergies in the combination.

A deferred tax asset of 18.6 million 2007: 3.1 million has been recognised in respect of losses, together with an asset of 11.2 million 2007: nil on other timing differences.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 339 million 2007: 159 million due to the geographic split of anticipated future profit streams.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to certain continuity of business requirements.
A significant part of the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Group accounts relates to the McKechnie UK Plan, the FKI UK Plan and the FKI North America Plans.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised on these obligations due to the unpredictability of future profit streams in the United Kingdom.
A small deferred tax asset of 1.0 million 2007: 0.9 million is recognised with respect to certain overseas pension schemes and is included within the tax losses and other assets category.
As at 31 December 2008, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 3.8 million 2007: 1.5 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The conversion formula for the 2007 Incentive Shares broadly provides for conversion into Ordinary Shares equal to 10 per cent of the increase in shareholder value from 18 July 2007 excluding the return of capital.
The 2007 Incentive Shares have early trigger dates upon which the Remuneration Committee can permit up to one third of the new 2007 Incentive Shares held by a 2007 Incentive Shareholder to be converted into Ordinary Shares in each of the years 2010 and 2011.
On 31 May 2012, the final trigger date, all unconverted new 2007 Incentive Shares will convert into Ordinary Shares in accordance with the formula set out in the Companys Articles.
The Articles do not permit holders of new 2007 Incentive Shares to convert more than two thirds of their holding of such shares before 31 May 2012.
The estimated fair value attributable to the 2007 Incentive Shares using a Black Scholes option pricing model was 1.0 million 2007: 3.7 million.

The FKI debt assumed on 1 July 2008 was substantially held at floating rates of interest.
This debt, including swaps used to synthetically alter the debts denomination, was repaid prior to 31 December 2008, being funded through floating rate debt drawn under the new 750 million committed facility.
This debt carries a cost of LIBOR plus an initial 2.0% margin.
In January 2009, the Group entered into a number of interest rate swaps to hedge US$546.0 million of US dollar denominated bank debt into fixed rates of interest.
Under the terms of these swaps the Group will pay an average rate of 2.1% p. a. plus a 2.0% margin annually in arrears and receive 3 month US dollar LIBOR plus 2.0% quarterly in arrears.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis Currency risks are defined by IFRS 7 as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The following table details the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial instruments at the balance sheet date, illustrating the increase in Group operating profit caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US dollar and Euro against Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Czech Koruna and Canadian Dollar against Sterling compared to the year end spot rate.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant.
The Group operates in a range of different currencies, and those with a material impact are noted here: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 m m US dollar 0.4 0.2 Euro 2.4 1.1 Canadian Dollar 1.7 Czech Koruna 0.6 The following table details the increase decrease in Group equity caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US dollar and Euro against Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Czech Koruna and Canadian Dollar against Sterling.
