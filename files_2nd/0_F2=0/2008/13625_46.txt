Total expense relating to these plans in the year was 1,469,000 2007: 1,030,000. ii SHARE BASED PAYMENTS Volatility assumptions for equity based payments The expected volatility of all equity compensation benefits is based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of each benefit, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
a Share option scheme At 1 January 1995 the Group established a share option programme for employees.
The allocation of options was linked to the completion of five years service.
In accordance with the programme, once vested the options grant the right to purchase shares at the market price they were at the date of grant.

The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to the 2000 and 2001 grants in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.

Employee benefits continued c Long-term incentive plan The Long-term incentive plan LTIP is a performance share or cash unit plan under which shares or cash units are conditionally allocated to selected members of senior management at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis.
No shares or cash units will normally be released to participants unless they are still in the Groups service following completion of four year performance periods for awards made up to and including 2005 and the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR against a comparator group of companies places it in at least the 50th percentile position in the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period.
The performance period for 2006 and future awards under the plan has been reduced to three years.
TSR measures the change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period of measurement.
The actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be determined by the number of shares or cash units initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage.
For the awards made up to and including 2005 this will be 40% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile with each percentile position above the 50th adding 2.4% to the vesting percentage.
From the 2006 award onwards, the actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be 30% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile with each percentile position above the 50th adding 2.8% to the vesting percentage.
The Companys earnings per share is also monitored during the relevant performance period to ensure it meets a minimum average annual growth equal to the rise in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 2% per annum.
Failure to meet the RPI requirement will result in nil vesting.
Following shareholder approval of the LTIP at the Companys AGM on 18 May 2000, awards over shares were made to executive directors and senior managers in each year from 2000 to 2008.
The performance period for the 2004 award ended on 31 December 2007.
Messrs.  LLP as independent actuaries certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 100% vesting of this award as the Companys position relative to the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period was above the 75th percentile and the Groups earnings per share growth has exceeded the minimum average annual growth in the RPI plus 2% per annum.
The performance period for the 2005 and 2006 awards ended on 31 December 2008.
Messrs.  LLP as independent actuaries certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 100% vesting of these awards as the Companys position relative to the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period was above the 75th percentile and the Groups earnings per share growth has exceeded the minimum average annual growth in the RPI plus 2% per annum.
The awards will vest during 2009.
