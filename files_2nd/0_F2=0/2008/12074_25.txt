The Companys activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with interest rate risk on its external variable rate loans and borrowings which are addressed by using derivative instruments to hedge this exposure.
The Company has a policy not to enter into speculative trading of financial derivatives.
The other main risks besides interest rate are foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk and the policies relating to these risks are discussed in detail below: Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the value of the Companys interest-bearing financial liabilities and assets.
The Company does not hedge its exposure on its interest bearing funding to from subsidiaries.

The fair values of long-term interest-bearing loans and borrowings and long-term receivable from a subsidiary are their amortised costs determined as the present value of discounted future cash flows using the effective interest rate.
The Company considers that the carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, amounts due from due to subsidiaries, trade and other payables and other current financial liabilities approximate their fair values and are therefore excluded from the above table.
