58 Notes to the consolidated accounts General information ITE Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered o ce is given on the inside back cover.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 1.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
Change in accounting policies Gains and losses on derivatives not in designated and e ective hedging relationships During the 2007 2008 financial year, ITE Group plc has changed its accounting policy in relation to the income statement disclosure of fair value gains and losses on derivatives not in designated and e ective hedging relationships.
Previously, ITE Group plc reported these fair value gains and losses in Administrative expenses in the income statement.
As a result of the change in policy, these fair value gains and losses are now disclosed as part of Finance income costs.
Management judges that this policy provides a fairer presentation of administrative expenses and a clearer presentation of derivatives in the financial statements.
The comparative financial statements for 2007 have been restated.
The e ects of these changes on the comparative gures are increase in Finance costs of 0.4 million and a resulting decrease in Administrative expenses.
Presentation of derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet In light of the change of accounting policy above and the movement in the value of derivative instruments in the period, the Group has also amended the balance sheet presentation of derivative financial instruments.
Previously, the fair value of derivatives was shown in Other debtors other creditors, but is now presented as a separate balance sheet caption on the face of the balance sheet.
Management believes that this presentation provides a clearer picture of the derivative instruments used by the Group.
This presentational change has resulted in a restatement of the comparative prior year end financial statements for 2007.
The e ects of these changes on the comparative gures are decrease in Other creditors of 0.7 million and a resulting increase in Derivative finance instruments.
Impact of new accounting standards In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is e ective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the Groups financial instruments.
In addition the following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the year ending 30 September 2008, and these have been adopted but have had no impact on the 2008 Group financial statements: IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions The following new standards have been issued which are not applicable to the Group since they are only e ective for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008.
These are also not expected to have a material impact on the Group financial statements: Amendment to IAS 23, Borrowing Costs e ective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
This standard requires all borrowing costs which are directly attributable to an acquisition construction or production of a qualifying asset to form part of the cost of that asset.
The Group does not expect a signi cant impact from this standard.
Amendment to IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements e ective for periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009.
The amendment introduces changes to the accounting for partial disposals of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
Adoption of these amendments is not expected to signi cantly impact the measurement, presentation or disclosure of future disposals.
ITE Group plc Annual Report 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 59 Amendments to IAS 32, Puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation e ective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The amendments are relevant to entities that have issued financial instruments that are i puttable financial instruments or ii instruments, or components of instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro-rata share of the net assets on liquidation only.
As a result of the amendments, some financial instruments that currently meet the fide nition of a financial liability will be classi ed as equity because they represent the residual interest in the net assets of the entity.
The amendments set out extensive detailed criteria to be met in order to be able to classify these instruments as equity.
The impact of these amendments is restricted to speci c cases and no analogies can be made.
The Group does not expect a signi cant impact from the adoption of this standard.
Amendments to IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement e ective for periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009.
The amendments clarify treatment of in ation in a financial hedged item and one-sided risks in a hedged item.
Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment e ective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
The amendment clari es that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only.
Other features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions.
It also speci es that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment.
Amendment to IFRS 3, Business Combinations e ective for periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009.
The amendment introduces changes that will require acquisition related costs including professional fees previously capitalised to be expensed and adjustments to contingent consideration to be recognised in income and will allow the full goodwill method to be used when accounting for non-controlling interests.
This will result in a change to the Groups accounting policy for purchases of stakes in controlled entities.
IFRS 8, Operating Segments e ective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 sets out disclosure requirements concerning an entitys operating segments, products, services, geographical areas in which it operates and its major customers.
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14, Segmental Reporting.
2008 Annual Improvements the majority of changes will e ect periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The standard makes 41 amendments to 25 IFRSs as part of the first annual improvements project.
The amendments include: restructuring IFRS 1, mainly to remove redundant transitional provisions: an amendment to bring property under construction or development for future use as an investment property within the scope of IAS 40.
Such property currently falls within the scope of IAS 16: and an amendment to clarify the circumstances in which an entity can recognise a prepayment asset for advertising or promotional expenditure.
Recognition of an asset would be permitted up to the point at which the entity has access to the goods purchased or up to the point of receipt of services.
The standard is not expected to have a signi cant impact on the Group.
In relation to the amendment to IAS 38 regarding prepayments for advertising or promotional expenditure, the Group will be required to reassess its accounting approach to re ect the requirements of the standard.

ITE Group plc Annual Report 2008 60 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued Basis of accounting ITE Group plc is a UK listed company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as the Group.
The Company is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that a ect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses.
These estimates and associated assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time and are used to make judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from other sources.
Actual results may di er from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Changes to estimates and assumptions are re ected in the financial statements in the period in which they are made.
The statements are presented in pounds Sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company drawn up to 30 September each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identi able net assets is recognised as goodwill.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the e ective date of acquisition or up to the e ective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classi ed as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the pro t and loss account.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured as the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
ITE Group plc Annual Report 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 61 Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identi able assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to bene t from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit, pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the pro t or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written o to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent pro t or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling denominated assets.
Intangible assets Computer software is initially measured at purchase cost, trademarks, brands and customer lists are measured at fair value.
Computer software, trademarks, brands and customer lists have a fide nite useful life and are carried at cost or fair value less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life.
The estimated useful lives are typically between three and seven years.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an inde nite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the asset for which estimates of future cash ows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment is recognised immediately as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
ITE Group plc Annual Report 2008 62 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write o the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Leasehold improvements term of lease Fixture and ttings 10 years Plant and equipment 4 years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the di erence between the sales proceeds and the carrying value amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise signi cant in uence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Signi cant in uence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of Groups interest in that associate which includes any long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identi able net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.
Any fide ciency of the cost of acquisition below the Groups share of the fair value of the identi able net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition i. e. discount on acquisition is credited in pro t or loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, pro ts and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case an appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Venue advances Where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either osetting against future venue hire or by cash repayment, the fair value is recognised based on the discounted value of future cash receipts.
The loan balance is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e ective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in pro t or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are recognised at cost as prepayments in venue advances and prepayments.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an out ow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the e ect is material.
ITE Group plc Annual Report 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 63 Financial Instruments Classes of financial instruments The Group aggregates its financial instruments into classes based on their nature and characteristics.
The details of financial instruments by class are disclosed in note 20 to the accounts.
Financial assets The Group classi es its financial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables and derivative assets at fair value through pro t or loss.
The classi cation is determined by management upon initial recognition, and is based on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Financial assets are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether its financial assets are to be impaired.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence of impairment.
Financial assets are derecognised in full or partly when the Groups rights to cash ows from the respective assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has neither exposure to the risks inherent in those assets nor entitlement to rewards from them.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insigni cant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value with all realised gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Cash Flow Statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
This category includes the following classes of financial assets: trade and other receivables and venue advances.
Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The estimates are based on speci c credit circumstances and the Groups historical bad receivables experience.
No interest is charged on the loans and receivables, due to either their short term nature or speci c arrangements in place, and hence the e ective interest rate method is not applied.
Derivative assets A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or little net initial investment and is settled at a future date.
Derivative assets are classi ed as at fair value through pro t or loss.
Derivative assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
These derivatives are acquired in full compliance with the Groups risk management policies.
Financial liabilities The Group classi es its financial liabilities into the following categories: bank borrowings, trade and other payables held at amortised cost and derivative liabilities through pro t or loss.
Financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
ITE Group plc Annual Report 2008 64 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis in the pro t or loss and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Where bank overdrafts are deemed to be integral to the Groups cash management activities, they are presented within net cash and cash equivalents in the cash ow statement.
Overdrafts that are considered to be nancing in nature are presented as nancing activities in the cash ow statement.
Trade and other payables Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Trade payables are derecognised in full when the Group is discharged from its obligation, it expires, is cancelled or replaced by a new liability with substantially modi ed terms.
Trade and other payables are short-term and there is no interest charged in connection with these, hence the e ective interest method is not applied.
Derivative liabilities A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or little net initial investment and is settled at a future date.
Derivative liabilities are classi ed as at fair value through pro t or loss.
Derivative liabilities are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge these exposures.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in pro t or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and e ective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in pro t or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Group designates its derivative financial instruments as cash ow hedges.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly e ective in o setting changes in the fair values of cash ows of the hedged item.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The e ective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ine ective portion is recognised immediately in pro t or loss, and is included in Finance income cost in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in pro t or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in pro t or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer quali es for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in pro t or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in pro t or loss.
The Groups use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups financial policies.
Further details on these policies can be found in the Business review on page 28.
ITE Group plc Annual Report 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 65 Fair values The fair value is fide ned as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
The Group determines the fair value of its financial instruments using market prices for quoted instruments and widely accepted valuation techniques for other instruments.
Valuation techniques include discounted cash ows, standard valuation models based on market parameters, dealer quotes for similar instruments and use of comparable arms length transactions.
Revenue Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised on a straight line basis at the time of an event taking place.
Revenue is recognised evenly over the days over which an event is held and if an event straddles a period end, then the revenue is recognised in each period based on the number of days of the event in each period.
Billings and cash received in advance, and directly attributable costs relating to future events are deferred.
The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred event income and prepaid event costs respectively.
Losses anticipated at the balance sheet date are provided in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the e ective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Barter transactions Where barter transactions occur between advertising and exhibition space and the revenue can be measured reliably, revenues and costs are recognised in the income statement.
Operating pro t Operating pro t is stated after the share of results of associates and pro t or loss on disposal of Group undertakings and before investment income and finance costs.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable pro t for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Taxable pro t di ers from net pro t as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on di erences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro t, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary di erences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which deductible temporary di erences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary di erence arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not a ect the tax pro t or the accounting pro t. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary di erences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary di erence and it is probable that the temporary di erence will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
ITE Group plc Annual Report 2008 66 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that su cient taxable pro ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are o set when there is a legally enforceable right to set o current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual rate where applicable.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in pro t or loss for the period.
Exchange di erences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in pro t or loss for the period except for di erences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains or losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Details of the Groups accounting polices for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates uctuate signi cantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transaction are used.
Exchange di erences arising are classi ed as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation di erences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Under the exemption permitted from IAS 21 the e ects of changes in foreign exchange rates, cumulative translation di erences for all foreign operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as zero.
Consequently, any gain or loss on disposal will exclude translation di erences that arose prior to 1 October 2004.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Employee Share Trust The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust ESOT.
Shares in the Company held by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity.
The costs of administration of the ESOT are written o to pro t or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
ITE Group plc Annual Report 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 67 Share-based payments The Group has applied IFRS 2 share-based payment.
IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value excluding the e ect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the e ect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the e ects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on managements best estimate.
Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Bene ts received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the following judgements and assumptions have been made by management and have the most signi cant e ect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or have the most risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year: Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cashgenerating units to which goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimation of future cash ows expected from the cash-generating unit for a period of 10 years and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The 10 year period used in the calculation is based on managements average expectation of the period over which the value will be derived from the cash generating units.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 September 2008 is 41.0 million and 16.1million respectively.
Intangible assets The valuation of intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of the additional future cash ows arising from customer relationships and trademarks to determine the value of those intangible assets.
This involves estimating the period over which the customer relationships and trademarks a ect future cash ows.
Share-based payments The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Groups share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives.
Management regularly performs a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest: this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
Taxation Being a multinational Group with tax a airs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a tax structure which makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and is often dependent on the e ciency of legal processes.
Such issues can take several years to resolve.
The Group however takes a considered view of unresolved issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that the eventual resolution could di er signi cantly from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Groups results and future cash ows.

The following is the analysis of deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: 2008 2007 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 3,617 1,671 Deferred tax assets 1,594 1,690 2,023 19 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1.5 million 2007: 1.3 million available for o set against future pro ts.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the unpredictability of future pro t streams.
These losses may be carried forward inde nitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary di erences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 3.7 million 2007: 3.1 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these di erences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary di erences and it is probable that such di erences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks can be found in the Business review on pages 28 to 29.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board has put in place policies that have been established to identify and analyse risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
ITE Group plc Annual Report 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 81 Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will a ect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence, exposures to exchange rate uctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward-plus or forward foreign exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Financial assets 2008 2007 000 000 EUR 44,972 25,099 GBP 12,136 37,787 USD 4,205 5,371 Other 12,462 3,178 73,775 71,435 Financial liabilities 2008 2007 000 000 EUR 8,793 11,319 GBP 5,926 2,926 USD 5,877 1,987 20,596 16,232 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below is based on a 10% appreciation depreciation of the Groups signi cant currencies against Sterling, applied to the net monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.

During the year the Group has been party to foreign currency forward-plus contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures to highly probable forecast Euro currency receipts.
The instruments purchased are denominated in Euros.
Under the forward-plus contract, the Group has a right but not an obligation, to sell Euros for Sterling at a speci ed strike rate at speci ed dates.
However, if the spot rate is at or below the speci ed barrier rate on any business day during the barrier period the right to sell Euros becomes an obligation, at the speci ed strike rate.
As at 30 September 2008 the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward-plus contracts that the Group has committed to amounted to v11 million.
These arrangements are designed to address signi cant exchange exposures for the next six months and are renewed on a revolving basis as required, subject to not committing the Group to less than six months or more than 18 months in the future.
At 30 September 2008, the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately 1.0 million 2007: 0.6 million.
These amounts are based on market valuations.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and e ective as cash ow hedges amounting to nil 2007: 50,000 has been deferred in equity.
Changes in the fair value of currency derivatives of 3.3 million 2007: 0.6 million arising where they are no longer designated as e ective hedges have been recorded in the income statement.
The Group has taken out foreign currency overdrafts in Euros and US Dollars to act as a natural hedge against certain currency trade receivable balances.
These borrowings have not been designated as hedging instruments by management.
All foreign exchange movements on these borrowings and trade receivables are recognised directly in the income statement.
Since the year end the Group has taken out forward contracts to sell v26.8 million into Sterling between April 2009 and September 2009 at an average forward rate of v1.27 to 1.
These forward contracts will be designated as hedging instruments against highly probable forecast Euro sales and as such any changes in their fair value will be recorded in equity.
Interest rate risk management As the Group has no signi cant interest-bearing assets, other than cash, the Groups income and operating cash ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its borrowings at oating interest rates.
This risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate level of oating interest rate borrowings.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section of this note.
ITE Group plc Annual Report 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 83 Interest structure of financial liabilities 2008 2007 000 000 Financial liabilities at variable rates: Bank overdraft 6,568 13,306 The following average interest rates applied during the year and in the prior year: Bank overdraft 2008 2007 % % EUR 5.6 4.1 USD 4.5 5.4 Average interest rate applicable to cash balances were 5.4% in 2008 and 5.3% in 2007.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for financial assets and financial liabilities at the balance sheet date.
With all other variables held constant the table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1% change in interest rates applied to the major currencies of net variable rate asset liabilities.
1% is the sensitivity rate that represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.

The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, venue advances and derivative financial instruments.
These represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Groups objective is to ensure all customers have paid before any service is provided to them.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The ageing pro le of the Groups trade receivables and the details of the Groups allowances for doubtful receivables can be seen overleaf.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments arises due to where the liquid funds are held.
The territories in which ITE operates do not always have banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies such as Moodys and Fitch.
The Group aims to minimise the exposure to credit risk by minimising the level of cash held in such banks.
The Groups exposure and credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.

The Group raise invoices on events using stage payments.
Any overdue amounts, after the stage payment due date, are reviewed and chased.
Management also review the debts due based on when an event has taken place, as this is typically when the service is provided.
Both measures are included in the table above as both are used by management to manage outstanding debts.
The trade receivables amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience, speci c credit issues and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical areas and the Groups exposure to credit risk is in uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less of an in uence on credit risk.
The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the debt will not be collected in full.
The allowance is recognised and measured as the di erence between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash ows, where material discounted at the e ective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The main component of this allowance is a speci c loss component that relates to individually signi cant exposure on shows which have taken place but the debt has not been collected in full.
This allowance is determined by reference to the speci c circumstances of each show and past experience.

Such risk may result from inadequate market depth or disruption or re nancing problems.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors.
They have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and debt facilities as appropriate.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, bank overdraft, which is disclosed in note 16 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 21 to 22.
