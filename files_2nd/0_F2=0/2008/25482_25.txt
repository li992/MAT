Financial statements Investec plc and Investec Limited Accounting policies For qualifying fair value hedges, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
Changes in fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk are also recognised in the income statement.
For qualifying cash flow hedges in respect of non-financial assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is initially recognised in equity and is included in the initial cost of any asset liability recognised or in all other cases, released to the income statement when the hedged firm commitment or forecasted transaction affects net profit.
For qualifying cash flow hedges in respect of financial assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument, which represents an effective hedge, is initially recognised in equity and is released to the income statement in the same period during which the relevant financial asset or liability affects profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognised in the income statement.
Trading derivatives Derivative instruments transacted as economic hedges but which do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives that are entered into for trading purposes are treated in the same way as instruments that are held for trading.
Embedded derivatives To the extent that a derivative may be embedded in a host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the income statement, the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a standalone derivative if and only if: The economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract.
A separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative.
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are offset when there is both an intention to settle on a net basis or simultaneously and a legal right to offset exists.
Issued debt and equity financial instruments Financial instruments issued by the group are classified as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer economic benefits.
Financial instruments issued by the group are classified as equity where they confer on the holder a residual interest in the group.
The components of compound issued financial instruments are accounted for separately with the liability component separated first and any residual amount being allocated to the equity component.
Equity instruments issued by subsidiaries of Investec plc or Investec Limited are recorded as minority interests on balance sheet.
Equity instruments are initially measured net of directly attributable issue costs.
Treasury shares represent issued equity repurchased by the group which has not been cancelled.
Treasury shares are deducted from shareholders' equity and represent the purchase consideration, including directly attributable costs.
Where treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, net proceeds received are included in shareholders' equity.
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity at the earlier of payment date or the date that it is approved by Investec plc in relation to dividends declared by Investec plc and Investec Limited in relation to dividends declared by Investec Limited shareholders.
Sale and repurchase agreements including securities borrowing and lending Where securities are sold subject to a commitment to repurchase them, they remain on balance sheet.
Proceeds received are recorded as a liability on balance sheet under repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities lent.
Securities that are purchased under a commitment to resell the securities at a future date are not recognised on the balance sheet.
The consideration paid is recognised as an asset under reverse repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities borrowed.
Securities borrowing transactions that are not cash collateralised are not included in the balance sheet.
Securities lending and borrowing transactions which are cash collateralised are accounted for in the same manner as securities sold or purchased subject to repurchase commitments.
2008 Investec Annual Report 218 Financial statements Investec plc and Investec Limited Accounting policies Financial guarantees Financial guarantees are initially recognised at fair value, being the premium received.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amortised premium and the best estimate of expenditure required to settle any financial obligation arising as a result of the guarantee.
Subsequent to initial measurement all changes in balance sheet carrying value are recognised in the income statement.
Instalment credit, leases and rental agreements Where classified as a finance lease, amounts outstanding on these contracts, net of unearned finance charges, are included in loans and advances where Investec is the lessor and included in liabilities where Investec is the lessee.
Finance charges on finance leases and instalment credit transactions are credited or debited to income in proportion to the capital balances outstanding at the rate implicit in the agreement.
Where classified as operating leases, rentals payable receivable are charged credited in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Contingent rentals if any are accrued to the income statement when incurred.
Property and equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments.
Depreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of each component on a straight-line basis over the anticipated useful life of the asset.
The depreciable amount related to each asset is determined as the difference between the cost and the residual value of the asset.
The residual value is the estimated amount, net of disposal costs that the group would currently obtain from the disposal of an asset in similar age and condition as expected at the end of its useful life.
The current annual depreciation rates for each class of property and equipment is as follows: Computer and related equipment 20-33% Motor vehicles 20-25% Furniture and fittings 10-20% Freehold buildings 2% Leasehold improvements Leasehold improvements depreciation rates are determined by reference to the appropriate useful life of its separate components, limited to the period of the lease.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land, however, similar to other property related assets, it is subject to impairment testing when deemed necessary.
Routine servicing and maintenance of assets are expensed as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure is only capitalised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group.
Investment property Properties held by the group which are held for capital appreciation or rental yield are classified as investment properties.
Investment properties are carried on balance sheet at fair value, with fair value gains and losses recognised in the income statement under principal transactions.
Fair value of investment property is calculated by taking into account the expected rental stream associated with the property, and is supported by market evidence.
Impairment of non-financial assets At each balance sheet date the group reviews the carrying value of non-financial assets for indication of impairment.
The recoverable amount, being the lower of fair value less cost to sell and value in use, is determined for any assets for which an indication of impairment is identified.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying value, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable value.
2008 Investec Annual Report 219 Financial statements Investec plc and Investec Limited Accounting policies Impairment losses are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period in which they are identified.
Reversal of impairment losses is recognised in income in the period in which the reversal is identified, to the extent that the asset is not revalued to a carrying value that would have been calculated without impairment.
Trust and fiduciary activities The group acts as a trustee or in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding, placing or managing of assets for the account of and at the risk of clients.
As these are not assets of the group, they are not reflected on the balance sheet but are included at market value as part of assets under administration.
Taxation and deferred taxation Current tax payable is provided on taxable profits at rates that are enacted and applicable to the relevant period.
Deferred taxation is provided using the balance sheet method on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base, except where such temporary differences arise from: The initial recognition of goodwill.
The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction has no effect on profit or loss.
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with the investments in subsidiaries and associates, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets or liabilities are measured using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Items recognised directly in equity are net of related taxation and deferred taxation.
Insurance contracts Insurance contracts are those contracts in which the group assumes significant insurance risk.
The deposit components of insurance contracts are unbundled and accounted for separately.
Insurance premiums are recognised in income in the period in which the group is entitled to the premium.
Insurance claims are recognised in the income statement in the period in which a contractual obligation arises for the group to make payment under an insurance contract.
Reinsurance assets and liabilities and associated premiums claims are not offset in the income statement or balance sheet.
Insurance liabilities are measured at their actuarial values, and are tested for adequacy on an annual basis.
Any deficiency identified is recognised in the income statement.
Employee benefits The group operates various defined contribution schemes and two closed defined benefit schemes.
In respect of the defined contribution scheme all employer contributions are charged to income, as incurred in accordance with the rules of the scheme, and included under staff costs.
2008 Investec Annual Report 220 Financial statements Investec plc and Investec Limited Accounting policies The assets of the defined benefit schemes are measured at their market value at the balance sheet date and the liabilities of the schemes are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The discount rate used to measure the schemes' liabilities is the current rate of return on an AA corporate bond at the balance sheet date of equivalent term and currency to the liabilities.
The extent to which the schemes' assets exceed or fall short of the schemes' liabilities is shown as a surplus or deficit in the balance sheet to the extent that it is considered recoverable.
Actuarial gains and losses related to the defined benefit asset or liability are recognised immediately directly in equity.
The group has no liabilities for other post retirement benefits.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairments.
For intangible assets with a finite life, amortisation is provided on the depreciable amount of each intangible asset on a straight-line basis over the anticipated useful life of the asset currently 3 to 8 years.
The depreciable amount related to each intangible asset is determined as the difference between the cost and the residual value of the asset.
The residual value is the estimated amount, net of disposal costs, which the group would currently obtain from the disposal of an intangible asset in similar age and condition as expected at the end of its useful life.
Intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortised, however they are tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs in respect of property developments that take a substantial period of time to develop for sale are capitalised.
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, and are recognised as soon as the group has created a legal or constructive obligation which will lead to an outflow of economic resources to settle the obligation as a result of a past event.
Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised on balance sheet.
Standards and interpretations not yet effective The following standards and interpretations, which have been issued but are not yet effective, are applicable to the group.
These standards and interpretations have not been applied in these financial statements.
The group intends to comply with these standards from the effective dates.
Revised IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 The revised standard introduces changes to the presentation of financial statements and does not affect the recognition, measurement or disclosure of specific transactions.
The standard will not affect the financial position or results of the group but will introduce some changes to the presentation of the financial position, changes in equity and financial results of the group.
The changes are not expected to be of any significance to the current level of disclosure in the group financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 2 - Share Based Payments applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 The amendments clarify that vesting conditions comprise only service conditions and performance conditions and clarifies the accounting treatment of a failure to meet a non vesting condition.
Adoption of the standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the group financial statements.
2008 Investec Annual Report 221 Financial statements Investec plc and Investec Limited Accounting policies Revised IFRS 3 - Business Combinations and consequential amendments to IAS 27 - Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements applicable for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the reporting periods on or after 1 July 2009 The main changes to the standard that affects the groups current policies is that acquisition related costs are expensed in the income statement in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services received, except for costs related to the issue of debt recognised as part of the effective interest rate and the cost of issue of equity recognised directly in equity.
Currently the group recognises acquisition costs as part of the purchase consideration.
IFRS 8 - Operating segments applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 The standard relates to disclosure requirements for segmental information and replaces IAS 14 Segmental Reporting.
The group is of the view that segmental disclosure is closely aligned with the requirements of IFRS 8 and therefore implementation of the standard would result in minimal changes to disclosure.
Amendments to IAS 32 - Financial Instruments Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements - Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 The interpretation introduces a restriction on the amount that an entity can recognise in the balance sheet relating to when the entity does not have an unconditional right to a refund.
The impact of this standard is currently being evaluated by the group.
IFRIC 14 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 The interpretation introduces a restriction on the amount that an entity can recognise in the balance sheet relating to when the entity does not have an unconditional right to a refund.
The impact of this is currently being evaluated by the group.
IFRIC 13 - Customer Loyalty Programmes applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes addresses the accounting by entities that operate, or otherwise participate in, customer loyalty programmes for their customers.
It relates customer loyalty programmes under which the customer can redeem credits for awards such as free or discounted goods or services.
The group is currently evaluating the effect of this interpretation on the consolidated financial statements.
The following interpretation has been issued or amended which are deemed to have no impact on the group financial statements but have not been formally adopted by the group: IFRIC 12 - Service Concession Arrangements.
Key management assumptions In preparation of the financial statements the group makes estimations and applies judgment that could affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Key areas in which judgment is applied include: Valuation of unlisted investments in the private equity and direct investments portfolios.
Key valuation inputs are based on observable market inputs, adjusted for factors that specifically apply to the individual investments and recognising market volatility.
Details of unlisted investments can be found in note 16 Trading Securities and note 18 Investment Securities.
Valuation of investment properties is performed twice annually by directors that are qualified valuators.
The valuation is performed by capitalising the budgeted net income of a property at the market related yield applicable at the time.
Refer to note 25 for the carrying value of investment property.
The determination of impairments against assets that are carried at amortised cost and impairments relating to available for sale financial assets involves the assessment of future cash flows which is judgmental in nature.
Determination of interest income and interest expense using the effective interest method involves judgment in determining the timing and extent of future cashflows.
2008 Investec Annual Report 222 Financial statements Investec plc and Investec Limited Accounting policies Reclassifications and corrections to prior year financial statements Reclassifications within asset and liability classifications Securitised assets and related liabilities, which continue to be recognised on balance sheet, are now disclosed as separate line items on the face of the balance sheet.
In prior periods, securitised assets were included within loans and advances to customers and trading securities and securitised liabilities were included in debt securities in issue.
This change in disclosure follows the acquisition of Kensington which resulted in a significant increase in these assets and liabilities, rendering it more appropriate to disclose these financial instruments on separate lines to provide information more relevant and useful to users.
Following the implementation of IFRS 7 disclosure requirements, the classification of certain financial instruments into balance sheet classes were refined to achieve more appropriate disclosure.
Adjustments to the prior year balance sheet includes: - 323.3 million reclassified from cash equivalent advances to customers to reverse repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities borrowed.
- 1 265.3 million reclassified from debt securities in issue to customer accounts.
Total assets and total liabilities were not affected by these reclassifications.
Corrections In the prior year 17.4 million of funding raised by certain consolidated private equity entities was incorrectly classified as minority interest on the balance sheet.
The correct classification was subordinated debt.
The impact of this correction is a reduction to minority interest equity from 291.2 million to 277.9 million at 31 March 2007.
There was no effect on reported earnings or financial reporting periods prior to 31 March 2007.

Net assets by class of business is not disclosed as the directors do not view it to be meaningful to provide this information by class of business since the economic capital of certain significant businesses of the group is not held in, or allocated to, these businesses, but is held centrally.

Analysis of assets and liabilities by financial instrument classification The table below provides details of the categorisation of on balance sheet assets and liabilities.
For financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value the table provides further details of the basis used for determining fair value according to the following hierarchy: Level 1 - The use of quoted market prices for identical instruments in an active market, Level 2 - The use of a valuation technique using observable inputs.
This may include: - using quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments: - using quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar instruments: or - using models where all significant inputs are observable, Level 3 - Using models where one or more significant inputs are not observable.
The table includes investment properties in the analysis of the basis used to determine fair value, as this is an asset carried at fair value with fair value adjustments recognised through profit and loss.
Assets and liabilities related to the long-term assurance business attributable to policyholders have been excluded from the analysis as the change in fair value of related assets is attributable to policyholders.

Derivative financial instruments Derivatives The group enters into various contracts for derivatives both as principal for trading purposes and as customer for hedging foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
These include financial futures, options, swaps and forward rate agreements.
All interest rate contracts are transacted with other financial institutions.
The risks associated with derivative instruments are monitored in the same manner as for the underlying instruments.
Risks are also measured across the product range in order to take into account possible correlations.
In the tables below, notional principal amounts indicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and do not represent amounts at risk.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument represents the positive or negative cash flows which would have occurred had the rights and obligations arising from that instrument been closed out by the group in an orderly market transaction at balance sheet date.

Called up share capital continued The group makes awards available to staff members via the underlying share trusts.
The particular instrument used varies from time to time depending on taxation legislation and factors affecting the group structure.
Nevertheless, whatever the instrument chosen, its underlying value depends solely on the performance of the groups' share price.
At present, the practice of the group is to give all permanent staff members an initial share allocation based on their annual package after completing four to ten months of employment in either the June or December allocations in terms of the guidelines of the Association of British Insurers.
In line with the objective of providing a long-term incentive for staff, these share awards vest over periods varying from five to eight years.
After the initial allocation referred to above, additional allocations are made to staff members at the discretion of group management and depending on the individual performance, and contribution made by, the respective staff members.
The extent of the director's and staff interest in the incentive schemes is detailed on page 177.

Legal proceedings Investec is party to various legal proceedings, the ultimate resolution of which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the group.
A number of legal actions have been instituted against Investec Employee Benefits Limited IEB a subsidiary of Investec Limited, which they are defending.
The legal claims were instituted against IEB by various industrial pension and provident funds during 2003 and 2004.
The legal claims are based primarily on allegations that IEB breached certain alleged implied terms of policies issued by them.
IEB will only have an obligation to pay legal claims once a final judgement has been made.
IEB's legal representative has advised that the funds have a difficult claim to prove and there is a reasonable prospect that IEB will successfully defend the claims.
IEB's insurers have indicated that the possible claims are covered by existing insurance cover, subject to any policy exclusions.
The directors of IEB are of the opinion that the provisions created are adequate to cover any potential loss and are not excessive.
Fair value of financial instruments Set out below is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair values of the group's financial instruments that are recognised on the balance sheet.
The table does not include the fair values of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.
Fair value of financial instruments continued The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial assets which are not already recorded at fair value in the financial statements.
Assets for which fair value approximates carrying value For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or having a short term maturity less than three months it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value.
This assumption also applies to demand deposits, savings accounts without a specific maturity and variable rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate financial instruments The fair values of fixed rate financial assets and financial liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing market interest rates when they were first recognised with current market rates offered for similar financial instruments.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money-market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity.
For quoted debt issued the fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
For those notes issued where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model is used based on a current interest rate yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.
Certain financial instruments that would normally be carried at fair value continue to be recognised at transaction price.
This occurs when the fair value would normally be determined using valuation techniques, which cannot be relied on due to insufficient external inputs.
This results in gains or losses which have not been recognised on balance sheet.

Post balance sheet events No reportable post balance sheet events have occurred between the end of the financial year and the date of this report.
Hedges The group uses derivatives for the management of financial risks relating to its asset and liability portfolios, mainly associated with non-trading interest rate risks and exposures to foreign currency risk.
Most non-trading interest rate risk is transferred from the originating business to the central Treasury in the Capital Markets business.
Once aggregated and netted, Treasury, as the sole interface to the wholesale market for cash and derivative transactions, actively manages the liquidity mismatch and non-trading interest rate risk from our asset and liability portfolios.
In this regard, Treasury is required to exercise tight control of funding, liquidity, concentration and non-trading interest rate risk within defined parameters.
The accounting treatment of accounting hedges is dependent on the classification between fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and in particular, accounting hedges require the identification of a direct relationship between a hedged item and hedging instrument.
This relationship is established in limited circumstances based on the manner in which the group manages its risk exposure.
Below is a description of each category of accounting hedge achieved by the group: Fair value hedges Fair value hedges are entered into mainly to hedge the exposure of changes in fair value of fixed rate financial instruments attributable to interest rates.
