The earnings measure used in adjusted earnings per share excludes, whenever such items occur: the results of discontinued operations: exceptional items: mark-to-market gains or losses on financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through pro t or loss: and amortisation of intangible assets initially recognised at fair value in a business combination.
All items adjusted are net of tax where applicable.
The weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by employee share ownership plan ESOP trusts, which are treated as cancelled.
The convertible bonds were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 as they were anti-dilutive: however, the convertible bonds were dilutive for the purposes of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
The impact of the charge for share-based payments was to reduce adjusted basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2008 by 0.7p per share 2007: 0.6p per share.

Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to one or more cash-generating units CGUs.
CGUs represent the operations of a country or, in more where appropriate, divisions within a country.
The size of the CGU therefore varies, but is never larger than a reportable segment.
The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the balance sheet date by geographical business segment: 95 Financial statements 18.
Goodwill continued 2008 2007 m m Nordics 862.9 717.7 France 656.0 496.8 United Kingdom 167.6 167.6 Netherlands 21.1 16.0 Germany 137.9 104.4 International 148.7 97.9 1,994.2 1,600.4 Movement in the year represents foreign exchange movements, and additions of 23.8 million in International and 2.1 million in the Nordics.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or CGU to their recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
At 30 September 2008, the recoverable amounts of CGUs were determined from value in use calculations.
During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting 2007: nil.
In all cases the approved budget for the following financial year formed the basis for the cash ow projections for a CGU.
The cash ow projections in the four financial years following the budget year re ected managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash ows.
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that re ects market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet date and the risks speci c to the CGU.
In determining the discount rate, management have applied an adjustment for risk of such companies relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
The discount rates applied to the CGUs were in the range of 8.1% 2007: 9.5% to 15.2% 2007: 15.4%.
The discount rates applied to the most signi cant CGUs were as follows: 2008 2007 % % Nordics 8.8 9.9 France 11.3 12.3 United Kingdom 10.9 12.6 Weighted average discount rate applied to CGUs in the Nordics and the United Kingdom.
The long-term operating margin assumed for a CGUs operation is primarily based on past performance.
The long-term operating margin refers to the margin on adjusted operating pro t as described in Note 9.
For those CGUs for which management has strong reason to believe that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins, expected future improvements from sustainable operating cost savings are also included in managements assessment of the long-term operating margin.
In such cases, these expected improvements exclude activities that would be fide ned as restructuring and are independent of technological change or evolution in best practices that the Group could not predict or in uence.
The long-term operating margins applied to CGUs were in the range of 6.0% 2007: 6.0% to 10.0% 2007: 10.0%.
The long-term operating margins assumed for the most signi cant CGUs were as follows: 2008 2007 % % Nordics 10.0 10.0 France 10.0 10.0 United Kingdom 10.0 10.0 Long-term operating margin applied is the weighted average of the individual CGUs in the Nordics and the United Kingdom.
96 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008 Financial statements 18.
Goodwill continued Long-term growth rates of net operating cash ows are assumed equal to the long-term growth rate in the Gross Domestic Product of the country in which the CGUs operations are undertaken, and were in the range of 1.9% 2007: 1.7% to 5.1% 2007: 5.0%.
The long-term growth rates of net operating cash ows assumed for the most signi cant CGUs were as follows: 2008 2007 % % Nordics 2.5 2.5 France 3.0 3.1 United Kingdom 2.4 2.4 Where there is a reasonable possibility of a change to any key assumption, a sensitivity analysis has been prepared.
In no instance does such a change result in an impairment charge.

The Group has no signi cant concentrations of credit risk since the risk is spread over a large number of unrelated counterparties.
The Directors estimate that the carrying value of financial assets within trade and other receivables approximated their fair value.

The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in net operating costs in the income statement Note 7.
Unwind of discount is included in finance costs in the income statement Note 11.

No bonds had been either converted or redeemed prior to maturity, 2007: nil.
The convertible bonds bore a xed coupon rate of 2.875% per annum, payable annually in arrears, and were issued at par value of 303.4 million on 19 September 2003.
Each 1,000 principal amount of a bond was convertible into one 2.875% exchangeable redeemable preference share of the issuer, Logica Jersey Limited, with paid-up value of 1,000 that would, in turn, have been exchangeable immediately for ordinary shares of Logica plc.

Borrowings continued All borrowings Bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes and other borrowings bear oating rates of interest based on LIBOR or foreign equivalents appropriate to the country in which the borrowing is incurred, and thus expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The finance lease obligations bear xed rates of interest and therefore expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
All borrowings are denominated in the borrowing entitys functional currency except for certain amounts drawn down under the revolving credit facility and term loans.
Borrowings not denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing company are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations see Note 27 and therefore only expose the Group to income statement foreign currency risk to the extent that the hedge is ineffective.
The Directors have estimated the fair value of the Groups borrowings as follows: 2008 2007 m m Bank overdrafts 5.4 9.1 Bank loans 548.5 354.7 Finance lease obligations 7.3 7.0 Convertible bonds 220.0 Other borrowings 3.6 0.9 564.8 591.7 Fair value has been estimated by discounting the cash ows relating to borrowings at the market rate at the balance sheet date or, for the quoted instruments, by reference to the prevailing market price and exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

The principal risks that the Group is exposed to are capital risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups policies with respect to managing those risks in both the current and prior year are set out below.
The Group does not undertake any trading or speculative activity in financial instruments.
The Groups treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding and foreign exchange management.
The Groups treasury function operates within policies and procedures that are formally approved by the Board, which include strict controls on the use of financial instruments in managing the Groups risks.
The policies provide written principles on net debt management, currency mix of debt, central funding liquidity, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, bonds and guarantees, and cash investment and counterparty limits.
Compliance with key policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a regular basis.
Capital risk management The Groups policy on capital structure is to keep the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation below a target level reviewed by the Board.
The target is comfortably below the covenants contained within the Groups banking facilities.
104 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008 Financial statements 27.
Financial instruments continued Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations in many countries worldwide, exposing the Group to foreign exchange risk on the translation of the income statement and balance sheet of foreign operations into pounds sterling.
Operations are also subject to foreign exchange risk from committed transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and, once recognised, the revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The translation of the balance sheets of overseas operations has been partially hedged by managing the currency mix of the Groups borrowings.
The Group used euro and Swedish krona borrowings to hedge the balance sheet translation of operations with the euro and Swedish krona as their functional currency.
The Group does not hedge the foreign exchange risk relating to the translation of the income statements of overseas operations.
To mitigate foreign exchange risk arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than an entitys functional currency, assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currencies are hedged economically by means of forward contracts.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting to these contracts.
The Group treasurys risk management policy requires all companies in the Group to hedge their material assets and liability exposures in full by using forward contracts.
Additionally, where material, the Group hedges its contracted future project cash ows in foreign currencies by using forward contracts.
Group treasury is the only entity in the Group allowed to transact external foreign exchange contracts with banks.
To ensure compliance with the above policy, subsidiaries will use Group treasury as an internal bank, hedging their material foreign exchange exposures on an inter-company basis.
These exposures are then aggregated and netted in Group treasury and the overall position hedged externally.
The foreign exchange exposures for the most signi cant foreign currencies reported to Group treasury and the related hedging of those exposures against UK pounds at 31 December were as follows: 2008 m US$m SEKm Reported exposure 207.5 49.9 137.1 Forward contracts 207.5 49.9 137.1 2007 m US$m SEKm Reported exposure 284.8 45.4 828.0 Forward contracts 285.1 45.3 827.8 Positive amounts represented an asset or a forward purchase, whereas negative amounts represented a liability or forward sale.
At 31 December 2008, if the Euro, US Dollar and Swedish Krona had strengthened by 10% against UK Sterling with all other variables held constant, post-tax pro t and equity for the year would have been higher lower, as follows: 2008 2007 Pro t Pro t & Loss Equity & Loss Equity m m m m Euro 1.4 33.0 2.1 22.0 US dollar 0.1 0.3 Swedish krona 0.4 31.8 28.9 If these currencies had weakened by 10%, the opposite would be true.
The movement in post tax pro t is as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona denominated derivatives used to hedge contracted project future cash ows.
The movement on equity is mainly as a result of foreign exchange losses gains on translation of borrowings and derivatives designated as net investment hedges.
The above impact on equity of movements in exchange rates does not include the change in value of the underlying investments denominated in foreign currency which are being hedged.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to fund its operations through a mixture of retained earnings, equity and debt.
Careful consideration is given to the appropriate split of debt and equity to ensure acceptable levels of liquidity and interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is then further managed by hedging a portion of the Groups oating rate borrowings at xed rates of interest.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had 80.0 million 2007: 224.2 million of xed rate borrowings out of total borrowings of 565.0 million 2007: 591.9 million.
If interest rates on oating rate euro, Swedish krona and UK pound-denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher during the 12 months ended 31 December 2008 and 2007, with all other variables held constant, post-tax pro t would have been lower as a result of higher interest expense on those borrowings, as follows: 2008 2007 Borrowings m m Euro 1.7 1.2 Swedish krona 0.4 0.7 UK pound 0.1 0.2 105 Financial statements 27.
Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain suf cient headroom to meet its foreseeable nancing requirements.
Substantial committed facilities are maintained with a syndicate of leading international banks.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had committed bank facilities of 848.3 million 2007: 735.9 million of which 532.0 million 2007: 331.4 million had been drawn down, giving headroom of 316.3 million 2007: 404.5 million.
The highest amount drawn down on these facilities during 2008 was 759.1 million 2007: 636.2 million.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial instruments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ows and include both interest and principal cash ows.
The adjustment column represents the possible future cash ows attributable to the instrument included in the maturity analysis which are not included in the carrying amount of the financial liability on the balance sheet.
Except for bank loans, the convertible bonds and finance lease obligations, balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not signi cant.

Financial instruments continued Hedges of net investments in foreign operations On 1 January 2008, the Group had euro and Swedish krona borrowings which it had designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in eurozone countries and Sweden.
The designated borrowings comprised the 2.875% 2008 convertible bonds until repayment, the SEK 650 million bank loan and forward contracts, and the Swedish krona drawn down under the Groups 150 million old revolving credit facility and Euros drawn down under the Groups new 500 million facility.
The fair value of the designated euro borrowings at 31 December 2008 was 200.9 million 2007: 220.0 million and that of the Swedish krona borrowings forward contracts was 19.7 million 2007: 52.1 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 111.0 million relating to these borrowings in the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: 27.9 million has been recognised directly in the translation reserve.
There was no hedging ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement in the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: nil.
This foreign exchange loss was offset by the rise in value in pounds sterling terms, of the Groups net assets in Eurozone countries and Sweden.
Cash ow hedges At 31 December 2008 and 2007, the Group had no derivative instruments that were part of a cash ow hedge relationship.

The property costs provided for are mainly related to properties located in the United Kingdom and Sweden.
At 31 December 2008, non-current vacant property provisions amounted to 31.7 million of which 29.5 million was payable within five years and the balance thereafter.
Restructuring At 31 December 2008, the restructuring provision mainly related to the restructuring of the businesses following the outcome of the Groups business review announced 22 April 2008.
The restructuring programme comprised property rationalisation, a reduction in headcount and other measures to reduce the cost base.
Where appropriate, provisions arising from the property rationalisation are categorised as vacant property.
At 31 December 2008, 21.0 million of the restructuring provision was payable within one year, 3.3 million between one and two years.
Other At 31 December 2008, the other provisions related to the value of legal claims brought by ex-employees and to other ongoing legal matters.
At 31 December 2008, 3.2 million of the other provision was payable within one year, with the remaining balance payable between two and five years.

The credit to pro t or loss for 2008 includes nil credit 2007: 1.3 million credit which is included in the pro t from discontinued operation.
The deferred tax liability for goodwill arises as deductions are allowed for tax purposes in certain territories.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and the Group intends to settle the balances on a net basis.
An analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes is shown in the table below: 2008 2007 m m Deferred tax assets 59.1 54.5 Deferred tax liabilities 119.3 126.2 60.2 71.7 At 31 December 2008, the Group had unused tax losses of 318.8 million 2007: 245.6 million available for offset against future taxable pro ts for which no deferred tax asset had been recognised.
At 31 December 2008, 112.9 million 2007: 82.6 million of the unused losses are subject to time expiry rules and will expire in full on or before 31 December 2022.
No deferred tax liability was recognised in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group estimated that tax of 43.5 million 2007: 62.7 million would arise in respect of remitting all earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the United Kingdom to the extent legally possible.
No share premium was recognised as the Company has taken advantage of section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 regarding merger relief.
The Company has one class of authorised and issued share capital, comprising ordinary shares of 10p each.
Subject to the Companys Articles of Association and applicable law, the Companys ordinary shares confer on the holder: the right to receive notice of and vote at general meetings of the Company: the right to receive any surplus assets on a winding-up of the Company: and an entitlement to receive any dividend declared on ordinary shares.

During the current year they have been consolidated into one trust the Logica ESOP Trust.
The trust was set up for the bene t of Logica employees.
The trust purchases the Companys shares in the market for use in connection with the Groups employee share plans.
The amount shown in the treasury shares reserve at 31 December 2008, which related solely to shares purchased and disposed of by the trusts, would be deducted in determining the amount the Company had available for distribution at that date.
At 31 December 2008, the employee trust owned 13,659,965 ordinary shares 2007: 14,575,290 with a nominal value of 1.4 million 2007: 1.5 million.
The trustees of the Logica ESOP Trust have agreed to waive the right to future dividends on ordinary shares held by the trusts except for a nominal amount.
At 31 December 2008 and 2007, the nominal amount payable to both trusts was 0.001p per share.
Translation reserve The translation reserve represented the accumulated exchange differences arising from the following sources: he impact of the translation of the income statement and net assets of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than pounds sterling: z t z exchange differences recycled on disposal of foreign operations: z exchange differences arising on the translation of net investments in a foreign operation where any subsidiary of the Group may have a receivable from or a payable to a foreign operation and settlement is neither planned nor likely: and z exchange differences arising on hedging instruments that are designated hedges of a net investment in foreign operations, net of tax where applicable.
Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve was a non-distributable reserve and contained the nominal value of the shares re-purchased and cancelled.
Other reserves continued Merger reserve The merger reserve represented the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of shares issued by the company to acquire at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company.
A purchaser company acquiring at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company under an arrangement, which provides for the allotment of equity shares by the purchaser in return for the equity interest in the acquiree must apply Section 131 of the Act.
When applicable, the section required that the premium on the issue of equity shares by the purchaser company be disregarded.
Accordingly, the Company did not record a premium on the shares it issued but recognised a merger reserve in the consolidated balance sheet.
During the year the Group issued 135 million shares which led to an increase in the merger reserve of 75.9 million.
This was net of expenses of 1.0 million.

Included in cash at bank and in hand were overdrafts that were part of cash pooling arrangements for which a legal right of off-set existed against positive cash balances that were of an equal or greater amount at the balance sheet date.
The Directors estimate that the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximated their fair value.
The Groups policy for cash investments requires that cash and deposits only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum A1 P1 short-term rating and Aequivalent long-term credit rating.
The reference to ratings must include at least one from either Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Cash and deposits are limited to 25 million per bank where the bank has a minimum AArating and 10 million per bank where the bank is rated A or A-.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by any of these counterparties.

Acquisitions On 15 February 2008, Energias fide Portugal S. A. EDP noti ed the Group of its exercise of the EDP Put Option, under the terms of the shareholders agreement entered into between EDP and Logica on 20 April 2005.
On 7 March 2008 the Group acquired the remaining 40% interest in the equity shares of Edinfor-Sistemas Informticos S. A. paying consideration of 42.1 million, which resulted in additional goodwill of 23.8 million.
The assets represented by the minority interest are included within the fair value table below at the amounts previously reported.
During the year, the Group made several acquisitions of small businesses in the Nordics, for a total consideration of 5.4 million.
The fair values of the identi able assets and liabilities acquired in all acquisitions were as follows: Carrying amount Fair pre-acquisition value m m Intangible assets 4.9 8.0 Property, plant and equipment 8.4 8.4 Inventories 0.3 0.3 Trade and other receivables 13.8 13.8 Current tax 0.1 0.1 Cash and cash equivalents 7.0 7.0 Trade and other payables 6.8 9.0 Borrowings 5.5 5.5 Deferred tax 0.5 Retirement bene t obligations 1.5 1.5 Net assets acquired 21.2 21.6 Goodwill 25.9 Total consideration 47.5 TOTAL CONSIDERATION COMPRISED: Cash 44.0 Deferred consideration 3.4 Directly attributable costs 0.1 47.5 Factors that contributed to the recognition of goodwill of 25.9 million on acquisitions during the year were: anticipated revenue and cost synergies with existing operations in Norway, Finland and Portugal: the value of the workforce in place and the anticipated pro ts from winning business in the future from new rather than existing customers.

If the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the financial period, the Groups pro forma revenue and net pro t for the 12 months ended 31 December 2008 would have been 3,594.6 million and 39.5 million respectively.
Share-based payment Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements The Group operates the following equity-settled share-based payment arrangements: the Restricted Stock Award RSA, the Logica Partnership Incentive Plan PIP, the Logica Performance Multiplier Plan PMP, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Sharesave Plan, the Executive Equity Participation Plan 2006 ExEPP 2006, the Employee Equity Partnership Plan EmEPP and the Executive Share Option Plan 2006 ESOP 2006 and two further plans, the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and the Executive Equity Partnership Plan ExEPP.
Under the latter two plans, no further grants will be made as their 10-year award cycle has come to an end, but under which executives still have current awards.
A summary of the main terms of the arrangements is given below, with particular reference to the terms of those grants for which a share-based payment expense has been recognised.
Restricted Stock Award On commencement of employment, in compensation for forfeited incentives, Andy Green received a restricted share award of 2,110,967 ordinary shares to vest over a period of four consecutive years from commencement of employment.
The number of shares that vest at each tranche will be increased by reference to dividends paid on shares between the grant date and the vesting date.
The shares are released in tranches at the end of March in each of the four years and vest immediately provided he is still employed by the Group on the vesting date.
The first tranche was granted in February 2008 and vested in March 2008.
Partnership Incentive Plan The PIP is a discretionary bene t offered by the Group for the bene t of its senior employees.
The value of the award is based on an annual pool determined by the reference to pro t performance.
Selected employees Partners are awarded point allocations in connection with a pool year, these points are then converted into conditional awards of deferred free shares following the determination of the annual pool.
The annual pool is determined by the level of pro t before tax achieved.
The conditional awards will vest three years from grant subject to continued employment but are not subject to further performance conditions.
Although this plan was not formally approved until February 2009 it had been communicated to those likely to participate in the scheme in September 2008 and the first pool year has been communicated as the year ended 31 December 2008.
As a result there is a share based payment expense in respect of this plan in 2008 despite the fact that no awards have yet been granted.
This plan is ultimately expected to replace the LTIP.
Share-based payment continued Performance Multiplier Plan The PMP is also a discretionary bene t offered by the Group to its most senior employees.
The PMP has the potential to reward the most senior employees with an additional award of up to twice the number of deferred shares awarded under the PIP.
PMP awards will ordinarily vest at the same time as the deferred share awards granted under the PIP i. e. three years from grant subject to continued employment and to the extent that the performance conditions attached to the awards have been achieved.
The PMP is conditional on a measure of EPS performance.
The PMP has been communicated as at 31 December 2008 so although there has yet to be a grant there is a share-based payment expense in respect of this plan in 2008.
The PMP is subject to the approval of shareholders at the AGM.
Long Term Incentive Plan The LTIP is a discretionary bene t offered by the Group for the bene t of its senior employees, as well as to staff with high potential or to recognise signi cant achievements.
An award under the LTIP may be granted as a conditional allocation, a nil or nominal cost option with a short exercise window or as forfeitable shares.
Cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards may also be granted or cash-based payments may be used to satisfy an award originally made in shares either in whole or part, although the Remuneration Committee does not currently intend to do so.
The maximum market value of ordinary shares in the Company subject to LTIP awards granted to any employee in any financial year will not exceed 200% of that employees base salary.
The intention initially is not to exceed 150% of salary.
The performance condition attached to one half of an award will require annual earnings per share growth to exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by between 3% and 7% per annum over three financial years for between 30% and 100% of this half of the award to vest i. e. between 15% and 50% of the total award.
The performance condition attached to the other half of an award will measure the Total Shareholder Return performance TSR of Logica over a single three-year performance period against a number of other companies.
30% of this half of the award will vest if the Company is ranked in the median at the end of the performance period, with 100% of this half of the award vesting if Logica is at or above the upper quartile.
The Remuneration Committee intends to review the performance conditions each year to ensure that they remain suitable and re ect the ongoing market.
Sharesave Plan The Group operates a savings-related share option plan under which employees enter into a savings contract with a financial institution to pay a xed monthly sum for either a three-year or, for grants before 4 October 2002, five-year period.
The price at which share options are granted is the mid-market price of a Logica share on the business day prior to the invitation to apply to join the plan to which a discount of 20% has been applied.
The aggregate exercise price payable is equal to the expected proceeds on maturity of the savings contract.
Share options may be exercised within six months of the vesting date.
There are no performance conditions attached to Sharesave Plan options.
On 3 April 2008 573,218 SAYE contracts granted in 2006 and 2007 were cancelled and replaced with an equivalent number of options with a grant date of 3 April 2008.
Under IFRS2, the incremental increase in fair values as a result of a modi cation, is expensed from the point of modi cation to vesting date.
The modi cation of the grants for 2006 and 2007 has led to an incremental increase in fair values of 0.2 million measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Equity Participation Partnership Plans The Group operates an equity participation plan for senior executives the ExEPP 2006 and in certain countries an equity partnership plan open to all employees the EmEPP.
The terms of both plans are similar.
Under the equity participation partnership plans, employees make an investment in the Companys shares, subject to financial limits, which must be maintained over a three-year vesting period.
Shares will under the Executive Equity Partnership and Participation Employee Equity Partnership plans for all grants prior to 2008 if a performance condition is met and the participant is still employed at the vesting date.
Under the ExEPP 2006, senior executives, in any one year, may invest in shares up to a maximum of 50% of net bonus paid.
These lodged shares will be matched on a 1:1 gross basis the Matching Award.
Matching Award shares will be released as soon as practicable after the third anniversary of the award, subject to the stretching performance conditions having been met.
The performance conditions in respect of the ExEPP 2006 have the same criteria as the Companys LTIP performance conditions described above.
Awards made in 2008 under the Employee Equity Partnership Plan do not carry a performance condition.
Awards of a matching number of shares are made at nil cost to employees and are exercisable for up to seven years after the vesting date, after which the award will lapse.
Although no further awards will be made under the ExEPP there remain outstanding awards which have yet to reach their third anniversary.
This plan was operated for senior executives as an equity-based investment plan subject to financial limits and the investment being maintained over a three-year vesting period.
Vesting will occur for those executives employed at the vesting date subject to a performance condition based on growth in the Groups earnings per share exceeding the growth in the Retail Price Index by between 3% and 7% per annum.
Executive Share Option Plan 2006 At the Companys AGM in 2006 shareholders approved the implementation of the ESOP 2006.
This plan has been introduced to allow awards to be made to senior executives working in jurisdictions where it would be inappropriate to make an award under the LTIP.
It is anticipated that performance conditions attached to any ESOP 2006 awards will have the same criteria as the LTIP noted above.
As yet, no awards have been made under this plan.

Share-based payment continued Executive Share Option Scheme No new option grants will be made under the ESOS, although options made under previous grants to senior executives and managers across the Group remain outstanding.
Options are normally exercisable between three and 10 years following grant, provided that a performance condition, speci ed at the date of grant, has been satis ed.
Typically, growth in the Groups earnings per share over the relevant three-year performance period is required to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 21% for the performance condition to be met.
ESOS option grants prior to 2005 have a maximum seven-year exercise period, while the exercise period for option grants in 2005 and 2006 is four years.
Retesting of performance conditions may be carried out twice for ESOS options granted in 2003 but only once for options granted in 2004.
No retesting is permitted for grants awarded in 2005 and 2006.
The exercise price of ESOS options is generally at least equal to the closing mid-market price of the Companys shares on the date of grant, although the pricing mechanism varies slightly for grants to French employees.
US Stock Purchase Plan US-based employees are eligible to participate in a tax-favourable share purchase plan.
They may save up to a maximum of $2,000 per annum, the savings being used to buy shares at quarterly intervals.
Logica North America contributes an additional 15% to the amount saved per employee.
US-based employees are not eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plan or the EmEPP.
Unilog Management Incentive On 10 January 2006, 1,790,000 options were granted for exercise in two equal tranches to five former Unilog managers.
This was a one-off share award.
For 1,100,000 conditional award shares the first half of the award vested in full following the achievement of the performance condition and the resulting shares have been released.
The first tranche of the remaining 690,000 conditional award shares vested subject to the achievement of individually set performance targets and have been released.
The second tranches of the full award achieved their performance targets and were transferred to participants during 2008.
Unilog Plan Following the acquisition of Unilog on 13 January 2006, the Company entered into liquidity agreements with the majority of the option holders in Unilog.
Under the liquidity agreement, outstanding options in Unilog will, upon exercise, be converted into shares in Logica plc, using a transfer ratio of 31.97 Logica plc shares for every one Unilog share.
Under IFRS 2, any amendment of the original terms and conditions of share options is fide ned as a modi cation and the portion of the original fair value charge not yet expensed should continue to be accrued over the period from modi cation to the vesting date.
If the modi cation increases the fair value of the options, the difference between the fair value of the original options and the modi ed options, both measured as at the date of modi cation, should be expensed over the period from modi cation to the vesting date.
The incremental increase in fair value after the modi cation to be expensed in the period up to the vesting date was 4.2 million.
The date of modi cation was 6 April 2006.
The calculation of the 4.2 million modi cation charge was made in two stages.
First the fair value of the options prior to modi cation was recalculated as at the date of modi cation, using the assumptions prevailing on that date, i. e. 6 April 2006.
The fair value of the options was measured using the intrinsic value of the options the share price at acquisition of 73 less the exercise price of each option.
Stage two of the calculation was to fair-value the options directly after 6 April 2006 using the Black-Scholes model.
The difference between the two calculations represents the incremental increase in fair value of 4.2 million to be expensed from 6 April 2006 to the vesting date.
The share price, exercise price and fair value of the original Unilog options in the table above have been translated into sterling using the exchange rate at the date of acquisition of 1.46 to 1.
The share price, exercise price and fair value of the original Unilog options at the date of modi cation have been translated into sterling using the exchange rate at the date of modi cation of 1.43 to 1.

The fair values of share awards under the Equity Participation Partnership Plans were measured at the market share price at the date of grant reduced for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period, for which award holders have no entitlement.
The fair values of the share awards under the PIP and PMP were measured as the market share price at 31 December 2008 as the actual grant will not occur until 2009.
Expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period commensurate with the expected life of the share option.
The period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 was excluded as management believe it represented a period of high share price volatility which is unlikely to be repeated in the future.
Share-based payment continued Share awards under the Equity Participation Partnership Plans are assumed to be exercised on the vesting date.
Sharesave options are assumed to be exercised three months after the vesting date, the mid-point of the contractual exercise period.
At the date of grant, it is assumed that performance conditions will be met in full.
Adjustments are made subsequently, where necessary, to re ect updated assessments of whether performance conditions will be met and the final determination on the vesting date.
The share-based payment expense also takes account of expected forfeiture from the balance sheet date to the end of the vesting period following cessation of employment.
A weighted average forfeiture rate of 9% per annum was assumed for calculating the share-based payment expense for the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: 9%.
For exercises prior to the vesting date, the additional expense between the calculation date and the vesting date is immediately charged to the income statement.
The Group recognised a total expense in respect of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements of 10.2 million 2007: 9.7 million including a Telecoms Products charge of 0.6 million.
Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements The Group does not operate separate cash-settled share-based payments arrangements: however, social security obligations arising on share option and share award plans are treated as such an arrangement for accounting purposes.
The liability for cash-settled share-based social security payments at 31 December 2008 was 1.4 million 2007: 1.2 million.
The movement in the liability resulted in an expense for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 0.2 million 2007: income of 0.6 million.
Retirement bene t schemes fide ned contribution schemes The Group operates a number of voluntary pension schemes of the fide ned contribution type in the UK and overseas, under which contributions are paid by Group undertakings.
In some countries, contributions are made into state pension schemes.
The pension cost charge for fide ned contribution schemes amounted to 112.7 million 2007: 99.2 million including a Telecoms Products charge of 1.6 million.
In Sweden, the Group contributed to the Alecta SE pension scheme which is a fide ned bene t pension scheme.
This pension scheme was classi ed as a fide ned contribution scheme as it is a multi-employer plan and suf cient information is not available to bifurcate the assets of the plan between the various employers.
Any surplus or fide cit in the plan will affect the amount of future contributions payable.
Alecta used a collective funding ratio to determine the surplus or fide cit in the pension scheme.
The collective funding is the difference between Alectas assets and the commitments to the policyholders and insured individuals.
The collective solvency is normally allowed to vary between 125% and 155%, with the target being 140%.
At the end of 31 December 2008, Alectas collective funding ratio was 112%.
In order to restore the level of collective solvency the board of Alecta decided in October 2008 that the company would go back to charging full pension premiums in 2009.
In 2008, lower rates than normal had been charged due to the high level of collective solvency in previous years.
Contributions for 2009 for the Group have been estimated at 6.0 million.
fide ned bene t schemes In addition, the Group operates fide ned bene t pension schemes primarily for the bene t of employees in the UK and the Netherlands, with smaller schemes in other European countries and the US.
fide ned bene t schemes are usually funded by contributions from the employing companies, and in some cases also employees, to meet the costs, at rates assessed by the actuary or insurer of each scheme, in regular funding reviews.
The schemes assets are held in funds separate from those of the Group.
Scheme bene ts typically provide for a pension in retirement based on years of qualifying service and final pensionable salary.
The most recent valuations of plan assets, reimbursement rights and fide ned bene t obligations were carried out at 31 December 2007 by quali ed actuaries.
The present value of the fide ned bene t obligation, and the related current and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The weighted average principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows: UK schemes Overseas schemes 2008 2007 2008 2007 Discount rate % 6.2 5.80 5.5 5.31 Average life expectancy for 65-year-old male years 23 22 17 17 Average life expectancy for 65-year-old female years 25 25 21 21 Expected return on plan assets % 5.9 6.50 4.3 4.12 Expected return on reimbursement rights % 4.0 3.10 General salary increases % 3.0 3.40 2.0 2.12 Rate of increase of pensions in payment % 3.0 3.40 0.4 0.56 In ation % 3.0 3.40 1.9 2.30 The Groups principal fide ned bene t schemes are in the UK and in the Netherlands.
In the Netherlands the mortality tables used for the year ended 31 December 2008 were the GBM V 0005 tables ageing trend 2007: GBM V 9500 tables ageing trend.
In the UK the mortality assumption used was 100% PNXA00 year of birth with future improvements in line with the long cohort projections and a minimum rate of future improvement of 1% 2007: PXA92 with improvements in line with the medium cohort projections.

The expected rate of return on equities is determined by reference to real historical equity market returns.
The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is calculated as a weighted average of the expected rates of return of individual asset classes.
The weighted average is calculated by reference to the amount in each class of plan assets at the balance sheet date.
Plan assets in overseas schemes include ordinary shares of the Company with a fair value of 0.9 million at 31 December 2008 2007: 1.5 million but do not include any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
Retirement bene t schemes continued The Group expects to contribute approximately 15.9 million 2007: 17.6 million to fide ned bene t plans in 2008, of which 10.9 million 2007: 12.7 million relates to UK schemes, including fide cit funding of 5.3 million, and 5 million 2007: 4.9 million relates to overseas schemes.
