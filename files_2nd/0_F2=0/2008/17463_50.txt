As the outcome of any legal proceedings is yet to be finalised, the timing of any payment is uncertain, however the Groups liability under this is capped at 3,575,000 with any amounts payable in excess of this to be reimbursed by Allianz Global Investors.
A corresponding receivable equivalent to any excess has been recognised as deferred consideration on acquisitions in trade and other receivables.
The onerous lease provision relates to dilapidations and a shortfall between expected sub-letting rents and future costs on three onerous operating leases.
The leases provided for have between two and eight years left to run.
The restructuring provision relates to restructuring of the senior management team in preparation for the integration of Cambridge Solutions Limited.
This is expected to be utilised during 2009.
The operational risk provision comprises an estimated liability in respect of identified operating errors which had occurred in the ordinary course of business in the Financial Markets sector up to 31 December 2008.
This is an ongoing provision representative of the nature of the securities processing market.
The early and part-time retirement provision arises from a statutory requirement for German businesses and is calculated under IAS 19 with reference to actuarial reports.
The Group offers long-serving employees the opportunity to retire before reaching the statutory age of retirement.
As the utilisation of the provision is dependent on the uptake of this opportunity by employees, and the timing of their decision to do so, the provision is determined using actuarial assumptions.
