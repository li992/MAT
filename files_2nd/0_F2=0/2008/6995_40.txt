Halfords Company Share Option Scheme CSOP 2.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP 1.
Halfords Company Share Option Scheme The CSOP was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three year performance condition.
For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share EPS over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 5% per year for the 2005 scheme and 3.5% for options granted in 2006 and 2007 respectively.
In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year.
For increases in excess of 6% but less than 10%, a proportion of the option in excess of 150% of salary can be exercised.
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
