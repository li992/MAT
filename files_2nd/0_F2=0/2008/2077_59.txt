The 30% Fe O cut-off for Kaaimangrasie was removed in September 2007.
2 2 3 2 3 6 GAC Project The resource has increased by 294 million dry metric tonnes in 2008 due to revision of resource modelling for the Definition Phase Study following the completion of a number of drilling programs, a change in bauxite density and changes to cut-off grade.
Data obtained from close spaced drilling has reduced the drill spacing that defines the resource classification, reducing the amount of resources reporting to Measured and increasing the amount of resources reporting to Indicated and Inferred categories.
The bauxite cut-off grades are 35% Total Al O and 10% Total SiO, compared 2 3 2 to June 2007 cut-off grades of 38% Total Al O and 10% Total SiO.

For one of 2 3 2 the Onverdacht deposits Fe O cut-off is also applied.
2 3 6 Worsley The change in mine life is due to the approved production increase currently being installed and scheduled for operation in 2011.
Worsley Alumina Project expansion to 4.6 million dry metric tonnes per annum mtpa alumina equivalent to 16.8 mtpa bauxite was announced 1 May 2008.
7 MRN The June 2008 increase in MRN Washed reserves largely reflects the promotion of the plateaux Arama, Greigh and part of Monte Branco to the reserve category following a 200m square grid drilling program.
A small amount of the reserve increase is derived from Bela Cruz, Bacaba, Teofilo and Cipo plateaux following a review of the model.
MRN Washed tonnes and grade represent expected product based on forecast beneficiated yield in the reserve area of 75%.
8 The MRN reserves are located on mining leases that provide MRN the right to mine.
In addition, MRN is required to obtain environmental approvals to allow infrastructure access and mining, these approvals are sought and approved on a staged basis as part of the normal course of business.
Current mining areas have full environmental approval, MRN is progressing further approvals to cover the total reserve area within a time frame required by the current life of mine schedule.

The most significant factor to explain the increase of Inferred Sulphide Leach resources are the economic assumptions used to define the resources pit limit, this volumetric increase affects low-grade sulphide material.
Additional changes are due to the depletion of resources through copper production, updated geological model incorporating new data, and variable cut-off grade policy for the resources contained in the reserve mine plan.
Part of the Sulphide Leach mine stockpile is classified as Inferred Resources due to uncertainty in tonnage, grade and metallurgical properties.
Oxide mineralisation continues to be defined on the basis of visual copper oxide mineralisation and a ratio of SCu TCu greater than 0.5.
However, recoverable copper of oxide mineralisation is now estimated on the basis of TCu, and SCu is no longer carried in the tabulation of Mineral Resources.
4 Cerro Colorado Cerro Colorado is an open-cut mine that lies within the oxidised and enriched portion of a porphyry copper deposit, with ore processed by leaching and SX-EW.
Changes compared to 2007 include depletion of production adjusted for reconciliation difference partially offset by the results of in-fill drilling that provided additional resource and improved confidence.
68 - BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2008 5 5463 BHPB AR Book.
Changes to the resource declaration include revised methods of resource modelling and classification, and updated economic and geotechnical parameters.
6 Pinto Valley Miami unit The Miami unit of Pinto Valley Operations is an in situ leach plus SX-EW operation within the upper parts of an oxidised and enriched porphyry copper deposit.
The Miami unit is currently on care and maintenance status, except that the SX-EW unit is processing leach solutions that continue to be cycled through the leachable resources.
7 Olympic Dam The tonnage increase in the sulphide ore type is due to additional drilling information in the south mine area 487 surface and underground holes totalling 192,000m.
The additional drilling information has provided greater confidence in the continuity of mineralisation.
This has resulted in the conversion of resource material from Indicated Resource to Measured Resource and from Inferred Resource to Indicated Resource.
As a result of the drilling, 600 million dry metric tonnes of new Inferred Resource has also been added.
Depletion of the Mineral Resource for mine production has been calculated by subtracting the actual mined out voids to the end of March 2008 from the Mineral Resource model, and estimated mine production for the period 1 April 30 June 2008.
8 Antamina Antamina is a large copper skarn with associated zinc, silver, molybdenum and bismuth formed by the intrusion of quartz monzonite stock into surrounding limestone.
A significant increase to the Mineral Resources relative to June 2007 is due to a May 2008 update to the resource estimate incorporating 105,000m of additional drilling and a new resource pit shell using updated economic factors.
Drilling is planned to continue through calendar year 2008 to expand and improve the resource estimate.
9 Cannington The Cannington deposit is a Broken Hill-type Ag-Pb-Zn deposit mined by underground open stope methods.
The increase in Mineral Resources compared to 2007 is largely due to higher metal prices used in the calculation of the break-even cut-off value.
A drilling program is currently in progress to extend and define shallow mineralisation in the northern orebody.

Oxide reserves scheduled for mining after closure of the oxide leach plant are reported as Sulphide Leach due to process destination.
Part of the Sulphide Leach mining stockpile has been removed from Ore Reserve classification due to uncertainty in tonnage, grade and metallurgical properties pending additional study.
6 Pinto Valley Approval to re-open the Pinto Valley unit was given in December 2006 upon completion of a Feasibility Study of a mine and mill re-start.
Mining activities were re-initiated in mid-June 2007, while milling started on schedule in October 2007.
The changes in Ore Reserves are due to lowering the mill feed cut-off from 0.27% Cu in 2007 to 0.25% Cu, changed haulage ramp design and other mine parameters, and a revised resource model, including revised classification.
Mine life only considers the extraction of the intact sulphide ore. Copper recovery of the low-grade sulphide stockpiles is estimated from the expected leach production during mine life.
7 Olympic Dam The increase in overall Ore Reserves is due to additional resource material being available for conversion to Proven and Probable Reserves.
In addition, mining parameters for stope design and grade factors have also been updated following review of the previous two years reconciliation data.
8 Antamina Reserves are reported on the basis of a reserve estimate completed in 2006, depleted by subsequent production.
A revised resource estimate was completed in May 2008 and is reported in this Annual Report, based on interim results of the ongoing drilling program.
Estimation of the associated ore reserves are still in progress at the time of this report.
9 Cannington Updated metal price forecasts have resulted in a lower cut-off grade and associated increase in Ore Reserves.

7 Mt Keith A mining study undertaken in 2007 has resulted in significant changes to the MKO pit stage designs.
The resulting evaluation has determined that some of the deeper reserve, which was reclassified in the previous year from Proved Reserve to Probable Reserve, has been removed from the reserves as it is uneconomic under current economic conditions.
The remainder of that Probable Reserve has been reclassified as Proven Reserves as a result of the pit stage redesign and due to the greater geotechnical knowledge of the project.

Manganese grades %Mn are given as per washed ore samples and should be read together with their respective yields.
Culturally significant areas have been excised from the resources G Quarry Rainforest adjacent to the local community.
This excision equates to 3.2 mt of ROM.
4 An agreement has been signed between Samancor Manganese and empowerment consortium Ntsimbintle Mining Pty Ltd.
The Ntsimbintle agreement has been signed by both parties but remains subject to government approval which is believed to be administrative in nature.
This transaction allows for the inclusion of part of the Prospecting Rights held by Ntsimbintle into the Wessels and Mamatwan Mining Areas in exchange for 9% equity in Hotazel Mines, thereby adding the resources within the Ntsimbintle Prospecting Right to the Wessels and Mamatwan Mining Rights.
The BHP Billiton share of Wessels and Mamatwan mines Hotazel Manganese Mines therefore drops from 60% to 54.6%.
5 The Mn cut-off grade at Wessels has been lowered from 45% to 37.5% due to the following: Wessels Mine has historically been a high-grade mine mean Manganese Mn content for W1 lump being 48%.
As a result only this high-grade portion was previously declared while a low-grade portion, W4 lump at a mean grade of 41.1%Mn, was not declared.
Selling of this low-grade product is dependent on marketing requirements.
Positive changes in market conditions now allow for the inclusion of all grades above a cut-off of 37.5%Mn.
The traditional W1 lump at a mean grade of 48% was also adjusted to 47%Mn.
6 The addition of the Upper Body to the Wessels Mine Mineral Resource arises from a process of extensive evaluation during FY2008, including the development of an ore body model largely based upon an extensive drilling database accumulated over the history of the mine.
7 At Mamatwan, the X Zone and Top Cut Balance have not previously been declared as Mineral Resource in the Annual Report.

6 Wessels and Mamatwan The criteria for determining reserves at Wessels and Mamatwan are geological stratigraphic controls, cut-off grade and plant feed requirements.
Plant feed requirements vary depending on the product specifications.
Improvements in the rail system and inclusion of lower grade ores as discussed below has allowed production increases at both Wessels and Mamatwan and therefore changes in the mine life.
7 Wessels Wessels Mine used to be a high-grade mine mean manganese content for W1 lump being 48%.
As a result, only this high-grade portion was previously declared and classified as ROM now called Lower Body-HG.
A low-grade portion, W4 lump at a mean grade of 42.2%Mn now called Lower Body-LG, was not included in reserves as the selling of this product is dependent on marketing requirements.
This report reflects these increased tonnages.
8 Mamatwan The X Zone has not previously been declared as Ore Reserve.
The inclusion of the X Zone in reserves increased the total reserve base and product that can be produced by the mine.

6 Peak Downs The 2008 reserves estimate is 535 mt marketable coal, which is an increase of 47 mt marketable coal compared to 2007 reserves.
After FY2008 production depletion 8 mt marketable coal, the changes are attributed to update of the Caval Pit geological model 55 mt marketable coal, additional surface rights 21 mt marketable coal, mining recovery and mined out adjustments -17 mt marketable coal and change in economic guideline -4 mt marketable coal.
Caval Pit geological model was updated in March 2008.
7 Saraji The 2008 reserves estimate is 252 mt marketable coal, which is an increase of 64 mt marketable coal compared to 2007 reserves.
After FY2008 production depletion 6 mt marketable coal, the changes in reserve estimates are attributed to improved mining recovery 22 mt marketable coal, additional drilling and mine planning 73 mt marketable coal and unfavourable economic assumption -25 mt marketable coal.
8 Norwich Park The 2008 Marketable Coal Reserve has increased by 41 mt.
After FY2008 production depletion 5 mt marketable coal, the changes in reserve estimates are attributed to additional drilling and mine planning 22 mt marketable coal, improved mining recovery 6 mt marketable coal, surface rights approval in Lotus 10 mt marketable coal, favourable economic assumptions 6 mt marketable coal and reserve footprint 3 mt marketable coal.
This years reserve includes the lower seams in Lotus and South Leichhardt pits.
9 Blackwater 2008 reserve includes the Blackwater and the South Blackwater deposits, which were reported separately in previous years.
Additional drilling, improvements in mining recovery over the previous two years and a reallocation of the split between metallurgical and thermal coal products have resulted in a reduction in ash forecast in the marketable reserve compared to the June 2007 marketable reserve.
10 Appin The increase in reserves is a result of the reclassification of part of the resource due to the exploration program carried out throughout the year.

10 Middelburg The approval of the Douglas Middelburg optimisation project has provided increased confidence in the coal marketability and transfer of the total reserve to Proved status.
11 Optimum The operation has been sold, effective 1 July 2008.
12 Cerrejn Coal Company The 74 mt reduction in Marketable Reserves compared to that reported in June 2007 is due to changes in the geological model as well as a change in modelling practices, reconciliation of the beneficiation plant recovery factors, revised moisture estimation and production depletion.
The Cerrejn reserves are located on mining leases that provide Cerrejn the right to mine.
In addition, Cerrejn is required to obtain environmental approvals to allow creek diversion for access and mining.
These approvals are sought and approved in the normal course of business and in a time frame that meets the current life of mine schedule.
