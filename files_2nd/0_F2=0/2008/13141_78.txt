132 Summary combined financial information in euros Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the summary combined financial information in euros 1 Segment analysis On 21 February 2008 Reed Elsevier announced a plan to divest RBI which was then classified as a discontinued operation in the 2008 interim results.
On 10 December 2008 Reed Elsevier announced the termination of discussions to sell RBI as it was judged not possible to structure a transaction on acceptable terms at that time.
RBI has therefore now been presented as a continuing operation.
RBI and Reed Exhibitions, previously presented together as the Reed Business segment, are now managed as separate divisions and are presented as separate business segments.
Comparatives have been restated accordingly.

Adjusted figures are stated before amortisation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill impairment, exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs, disposals and other non operating items, acquisition related finance costs, related tax effects and movements in deferred taxation assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in the near term.
Adjusted operating profit is also grossed up to exclude the equity share of taxes in joint ventures.
Exceptional restructuring costs relate to the major restructuring programme announced in February 2008 and in RBI not included in the February 2008 announcement as the business was to be divested.
Acquisition related costs relate to acquisition integration and fees incurred in acquisition financing.
Adjusted operating cash flow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures but before payments in relation to exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs.

138 Summary combined financial information in euros Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the summary combined financial information in euros 5 Acquisitions On 19 September 2008 Reed Elsevier acquired the entire share capital of ChoicePoint, Inc. for a total consideration of u2,457m, after taking account of net cash acquired of u58m.
A number of other acquisitions, none of which were individually significant, were made for a total consideration of u252m, after taking account of net cash acquired of u6m.
The net assets of the businesses acquired are incorporated at their fair value to the combined businesses.
Provisional fair values of the consideration given and the assets and liabilities acquired are summarised below.

In addition, goodwill arises on the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions.
ii The provisional fair value of intangible assets acquired with ChoicePoint have been established with advice from independent qualified valuers.
iii Consideration for ChoicePoint comprises u2,487m to acquire the entire share capital and u28m of professional fees and other costs relating to the acquisition.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are provisional pending the completion of the valuation exercise.
Final fair values will be incorporated in the 2009 combined financial statements.
The businesses acquired in 2008 contributed u227m to revenue, u52m to adjusted operating profit, increased adjusted profit attributable by u26m, decreased profit attributable by u13m and contributed u53m to net cash inflow from operating activities for the part year under Reed Elsevier ownership and before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
Had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a proforma basis the Reed Elsevier revenues, adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit attributable and profit attributable for the year would have been u7,205m, u1,842m, u1,228m, and u588m respectively before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
