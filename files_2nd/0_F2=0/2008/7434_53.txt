The Directors are unable to determine how much of the Scheme deficit of 16.9m, recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity in the Company, is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the Scheme.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Company statement of recognised income and expenses before 25 April 2004.
