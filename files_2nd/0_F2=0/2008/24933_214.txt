Pending the resolution of the proceedings, the Financial Services Authority FSA has granted firms including HSBC Bank a waiver enabling them to place relevant complaints about the charges on hold and the County Courts have stayed all individual customer claims.
Certain preliminary issues in these proceedings have been heard in the Commercial Division of the High Court.
This has confirmed that HSBC Banks current and historic charges are capable of being tested for fairness but are not capable of being penalties.
