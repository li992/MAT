A combination of reducing headcount, virtually stopping business expansion, eliminating marginal activities and challenging suppliers to be more cost effective has been successful, but it has resulted in the Group incurring some significant one off charges.
In addition, the slowdown in the property market means that there is considerably less opportunity to sublet the Groups empty trading properties, a situation which may exist for many years.
Accordingly it is likely that the Group will have to pay significant property running costs in respect of these properties for longer than previously anticipated.
Therefore, to enable readers of the financial statements to obtain a clear understanding of underlying trading, the Directors have shown separately the exceptional level of spend in the Group income statement.
The total charge of 56.2m includes a cost of redundancy and re-organisation 10.5m, onerous property lease provisions 39.5m and asset write offs 6.2m.
40.4m and 15.8m were included in selling and distribution costs and administrative expenses respectively.
