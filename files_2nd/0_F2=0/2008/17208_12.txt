Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs which are identified according to geographical segment as follows: 2008 2007 m m UK & Ireland 55.9 41.0 Mainland Europe 39.3 32.7 95.2 73.7 The UK & Ireland goodwill balance in the above table includes the goodwill arising in respect of the two UK acquisitions made in the year of Hanbury Davies and Swales see note 22.
The goodwill in respect of the former currently remains capable of separate testing for impairment, however in the future it will be fully integrated into the existing Wincanton business and separate identification of future results and cash flows will not be practicable.
The Swales acquisition has been fully integrated with the prior year acquisition of RDL and the results and cash flows of the resulting combined construction business have been utilised in testing for impairment.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations are cash flow projections based on the financial budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the forthcoming financial year and beyond.
Cash flows beyond those 12 and further 48-month periods are extrapolated over a further 19 or 16 years respectively using the estimated growth rates and underlying inflation rates stated overleaf, which do not exceed the long-term average growth and inflation rates in the specific geographical areas where the CGU operates.
A 20-year cash flow projection period is viewed as appropriate when considering the value-in-use of goodwill.

The Group owns 100% of the share capital of a captive insurer whose functions are to both insure and to reinsure certain of the risks of the Group.
The insurance provisions in the above table are held in respect of outstanding insurance claims, the majority of which are expected to be paid within two to six years.
The discount unwinding arises on the employers liability policy which is discounted over a period of seven years at a rate based on the Bank of England base rate.
The assets of the captive consist of cash deposits held with various banks, typically on three month fixed interest deposits.
22 Acquisitions Current year acquisitions In November 2007 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Swales Haulage Ltd Swales for 4.5m in cash.
Swales operates in the UK and provides contract logistics services to the building products and construction sector.
In January 2008 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Hanbury Davies Ltd Hanbury Davies for 25.0m in cash, of which up to 2.5m is deferred pending earn out performance.
Hanbury Davies operates in the UK providing container logistics services to customers that include major shipping lines and freight forwarders.
In March 2008 the Group acquired HeBo GmbH HeBo for 2.9m in cash, of which 0.5m is deferred pending earn out performance.
HeBo is a specialist provider of logistics services to the high-tech industry in the North Rhine Westfalia region of Germany.
In the period since acquisition Swales contributed 0.1m, Hanbury Davies contributed 0.6m and HeBo contributed 25,000 of operating profit.
If the acquisitions had occurred on the first date of the year it is estimated that the totals of Group underlying operating profit and revenue would have been approximately 55.5m and 2,222.2m respectively.
The acquisitions have given rise to values of goodwill of 2.4m, 12.0m and 1.5m for Swales, Hanbury Davies and HeBo respectively, being the difference between the cash consideration payable and the net assets acquired at fair value.
69 Wincanton plc Annual Report 2008 notes to the consoliDateD financial statements continued The acquired net assets at acquisition are summarised in the combined table below: Acquirees Fair value Acquisition book value adjustments amounts m m m Intangible assets 0.1 11.6 11.7 Property, plant and equipment 9.0 0.3 8.7 Inventories 0.5 0.5 Trade and other receivables 14.8 0.1 14.7 Cash and cash equivalents 0.2 0.2 Income tax payable 0.3 0.2 0.5 Borrowings 3.7 3.7 Trade and other payables 11.4 11.4 Deferred tax liabilities 0.8 3.5 4.3 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 8.4 7.5 15.9 Goodwill on acquisition 15.9 Consideration payable including expenses of 0.6m 31.8 Cash acquired and debt repaid on acquisition 3.5 35.3 Less deferred consideration 2.9 Net cash outflow 32.4 The fair value adjustments above are required to align the accounting policies of the acquired businesses with those of the Group.
These adjustments can, if necessary, be amended for up to 12 months following acquisition.
The total goodwill of 15.9m arising on the acquisitions reflects the strategic importance of broadening Wincantons business offering in these growing sectors of the UK and German economies, the value of the management and workforce and some of the expected synergies to be gained as the acquired entities are fully integrated into the Group.
Prior year acquisitions In October 2006 the Group acquired the entire share capital of RDL Holdings Limited RDL and Lane Group plc Lane for 29.5m and 0.7m in cash respectively, of which 5.0m of the former was deferred pending earn out performance and has been paid in full in the current year.
The acquisitions gave rise to values of goodwill of 11.5m and 7.4m for RDL and Lane respectively, being the difference between the cash consideration payable and the net assets acquired at fair value.

At 31 March 2008 the authorised share capital comprised 159,999,980 2007:159,999,980 ordinary shares of 10p each.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.
All shares rank equally with regard to the Companys residual assets.
In respect of the Companys shares that are held by the Group see below, all rights are suspended until these shares are reissued.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose from the original acquisition of the then Wincanton group of companies by Wincanton plc on the demerger from the previous parent in May 2001, which was accounted for under merger accounting principles.
Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Companys net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
IFRS 2 reserve Since 1 April 2004 the IFRS 2 reserve comprises the charges made to the income statement in respect of share-based payments under the Groups share option schemes.
71 Wincanton plc Annual Report 2008 notes to the consoliDateD financial statements continued Own shares The own shares reserve comprises the cost of the Companys shares held by the Group within an Employee Benefit Trust EBT established in Jersey and managed on its behalf by independent trustees.
At 31 March 2008 the number of the Companys shares held by the Group had increased to 4,801,973 2007: 3,080,661 due to the purchase of further shares in the Company less the settlement of options exercised.
The EBT has waived the right to receive dividends in respect of these shares.
All of the shares in the EBT are held in respect of the Groups various equity compensation schemes see note 27 and at 31 March 2008 1,834,869 of these were held in respect of vested options.
The average cost of the shares held is 306p each and at the year end the market value of the shares held was 16.6m 2007: 11.5m 24 Capital commitments Capital commitments for the Group at the end of the financial year for which no provision has been made, are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Contracted 15.4 5.0 25 Operating leases Leases as lessee The Group leases warehousing facilities, commercial vehicles and other logistics equipment for use in its operations.
Typical lease periods for new warehouse rental contracts are between 5 and 15 years although older rental contracts are for longer periods with intervening break clauses.
The average period for vehicles and equipment is 4 years.
Wherever possible these commitments are mitigated by the existence of contractual commitments of customers for whom the properties are occupied and or vehicles and plant are rented.
The amounts charged to the income statement in the current and prior year are given in note 3.

In addition certain employment contracts of employees in the Group give rise to holiday pay obligations which are deferred at the accounting year end due to the relative timing of the annual holiday year.
These two elements are analysed in the table below and the pension arrangements discussed in detail: 2008 2007 m m Holiday pay 7.2 6.2 Pension plans see below 33.5 101.1 40.7 107.3 These employee benefits are split as follows: Current 8.9 7.7 Non-current 31.8 99.6 40.7 107.3 Pension schemes Employees of Wincanton participated in both funded and unfunded pension arrangements in the UK, Ireland and in Mainland Europe during the year ended 31 March 2008, details of these are given below.
The principal Wincanton Scheme in the UK the Scheme is a funded arrangement which has three defined benefit sections, plus a defined contribution section called the Wincanton Retirement Savings Section.
The employees of Wincanton Ireland Limited are eligible to participate in a separate funded defined contribution scheme.
Assets of these pension arrangements are held in separate Trustee administered funds independent of Wincanton.
A small number of senior employees, who were subject to the statutory earnings cap on pensionable earnings prior to 6 April 2006, are entitled to participate in an unfunded unapproved arrangement in addition to accruing benefits from the Scheme.
The unfunded unapproved arrangement generally aims to supplement the benefits payable under the Scheme so as to produce when added to benefits from the Scheme benefits that would otherwise be payable from the Scheme had they not been subject to the maximum permitted earnings as provided by HMRC before 6 April 2006 and as continued by a deed executed by the Trustees of the Scheme on 23 March 2006.
The pension cost in relation to this arrangement plus the defined benefit sections of the Scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2005 by the Scheme actuary, Hymans Robertson, and as a result, the Group, in consultation with the Trustees and the Scheme actuary, has agreed a series of measures to address both the actuarial past service deficit and the level of future service cost of the Scheme.
The measures in respect of the cost of future service accrual were subject to consultation with, and acceptance by, employees in the early part of the year ended 31 March 2007.
The Group has made an additional 8m cash contribution during the year 2007: 8m, designed to address the past service deficit of the Scheme.
In the year commencing 1 April 2008, the Group contributions are expected to be approximately 29m, including an incremental cash contribution of 8m.
The contributions are subject to review following the results of the next formal actuarial valuation, due at 31 March 2008, which is expected to be finalised by 31 March 2009.
Contributions are made to a number of smaller pension arrangements for employees elsewhere in Mainland Europe, and Wincanton has assumed liability for certain historic unfunded pension obligations of the German business which closed to future service in the 1980s.
The pension charge in respect of this arrangement represents interest on the unfunded obligations.
Pension scheme deficit The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes of the Group are calculated in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits and are set out in the tables below.
The calculations under IAS 19 are based on actuarial assumptions which are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible assumptions about the long-term future which, unless by chance, will not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are thus inherently uncertain.

The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the Schemes investment portfolio, net of investment management expenses.
The assets of the Scheme are held in the following proportions as at 31 March 2008: equities 55%, corporate bonds 27%, government bonds 13%, property 3%, and cash 2%.
The actual loss return on assets during the year was 22.4 m 2007: 26.3m.
Liability for defined benefit obligations The principal actuarial assumptions for the Scheme and for the other unfunded arrangements at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2008 2007 % % Price inflation rate 3.50 3.10 Discount rate 6.95 5.50 Pensionable salaries rate 3.50 3.10 Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferred pensions for service to 31 March 2006 3.50 3.10 for service from 1 April 2006 2.50 2.50 For the majority of Scheme members, increases in pensionable salaries are now capped at the same level as price inflation.
A discount rate of 5.3% 2007: 4.5% per annum and an average pension increase rate of 2.0% 2007: 1.5% per annum are the principal actuarial assumptions adopted for the German schemes as at 31 March 2008.
The assumptions used for mortality rates for members of these arrangements at the expected retirement age of 65 years are as follows: 2008 2007 years years Male aged 65 today 19.8 19.7 Male aged 45 today 21.0 21.0 Female aged 65 today 22.8 22.7 Female aged 45 today 24.0 23.9 75 Wincanton plc Annual Report 2008 notes to the consoliDateD financial statements continued Sensitivity table The sensitivity of the present value of the Scheme obligations to changes in the key actuarial assumptions are set out in the following table.
The illustrations consider the result of only a single assumption changing with the others assumed unchanged, although in reality it is more likely that more than one assumption would change and potentially the results would offset each other.
For example, a fall in interest rates will increase the Scheme obligations, but may also trigger an offsetting increase in market value of certain Scheme assets.

The Group schemes all provide for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares for a short period immediately prior to the date of grant.
The number and weighted average exercise price of all share options extant under the Executive, Performance Share Plan, Share Match Incentive and Sharesave Option schemes are as follows: 2008 2007 Weighted average Weighted average exercise price exercise price Options pence Options pence Outstanding at beginning of period 10,896,685 292 10,792,227 259 Granted during the period 5,644,246 167 3,057,344 332 Lapsed during the period 823,796 271 718,614 196 Exercised during the period 1,708,533 255 2,234,272 257 Outstanding at the end of the period 14,008,602 248 10,896,685 292 Exercisable at the end of the period 2,952,784 245 1,629,748 193 77 Wincanton plc Annual Report 2008 notes to the consoliDateD financial statements continued The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 370p 2007: 329p.
The options outstanding at 31 March 2008 had a range of exercise prices of between nil and 384p and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7 years.
Under Adopted IFRS, the grants of options since 7 November 2002 are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments, which requires the fair value of services received in return for share options granted to be recognised in the income statement over the vesting period.
The fair value of these services is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted.
Executive, Share Match Incentive Original and Sharesave Option schemes The awards made under these schemes all have non-market based performance conditions which are taken into account in the fair value calculation using a Binomial pricing model.
The contractual life of the options and the expectation of early exercises are incorporated into the model.
The other key inputs used in the model for options granted in the current and prior year are as follows: 2008 2007 Weighted average price at grant date 384p 343p Expected volatility 25.0% 26.0% Expected life 5 years 5 years Risk free rate 4.78% 4.92% Expected dividend yield 4.00% 4.00% Expected volatility is based on a 4 year average of the historic share price volatility where possible and where this is not possible due to the fact that the Company was only demerged in May 2001, historic share price volatility has been calculated over the period since demerger.
Performance Share Plan and Share Match Incentive Revised Scheme The awards under these schemes are made in two parts based on EPS and TSR performance and a separate fair value is required for each part: a The EPS requirement is a non-market based performance condition and as the award is at nil cost the fair value is equivalent to the option value i. e. the average share price of the Company for the three days prior to the award date.
b The TSR requirement is a market based performance condition and the fair value is calculated by applying a discount to the option value.
The discount is calculated using scenariomodelling and is the expected outcome of meeting the performance criteria.
The Group recognised total expenses of 3.4m 2007: 2.3m in respect of the costs of equity settled and other share-based payment transactions during the year.
At the year end liabilities of 0.8m 2007: 0.7m were included in the balance sheet for these items.
28 Financial instruments Financial risk management and treasury policies The Group, through its activities, is exposed to a range of financial risks.
Financial risks are managed through the Groups centralised treasury function which acts within clearly-defined policies approved by the Board.
These policies are designed to reduce the financial risks faced by the Group relating to liquidity risk: market risk being interest rate and currency exchange rate exposure and credit risk.
Transactions of a speculative nature are not permitted and the treasury function does not operate as a profit centre.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group has financed its growth in recent years through retained profit and debt.
The Groups policy on funding capacity is to ensure that there is always sufficient long-term funding and short-term facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.
There were no material changes to the Groups committed facilities during the year.
The Groups core facilities are a 210m multi-currency syndicated bank loan which matures in November 2010: and a US$150m private placement which has been swapped into sterling and euros, and matures in 2012 $95m and 2015 $55m.
In addition the Group has overdraft and other uncommitted facilities which are used to manage short-term fluctuations in working capital.
At 31 March 2008 the Groups syndicated bank loan was 47.8m drawn leaving headroom of 162.2m 2007: 168m The Group holds interest bearing cash deposits, the majority of which are held in sterling and held within the captive insurer.
These deposits have a mix of maturities, none of which are greater than 12 months.
The income earned on these deposits is subject to changes in interest rates.
See note 19 for further analysis of the contractual maturities of financial liabilities.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
78 Wincanton plc Annual Report 2008 Interest rate risk The Group maintains a policy of using derivatives to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed, capped, and floating interest profiles, so as to limit the exposure to the cash cost of servicing its debt.
The majority of the Groups drawn debt at 31 March 2008 is in floating rates, mainly derived from the US$ private placement.
This floating rate exposure has been managed by using interest rate swaps and caps.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a change in interest rates of 0.5% on the Groups profit before tax, and equity.
A variation of 0.5% represents managements view of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Any impact on equity excludes the possible effect which a change in interest rates may have on the present value of the Groups pension obligations, the effects of which are set out in note 26.
Effect on profit Effect before tax on equity m m 2008 Sterling 0.5% increase in rates 0.5 0.5 0.5% decrease in rates 0.5 0.5 Euro 0.5% increase in rates 0.2 0.2 0.5% decrease in rates 0.6 0.6 2007 Sterling 0.5% increase in rates 0.2 0.2 0.5% decrease in rates 0.2 0.2 Euro 0.5% increase in rates 0.3 0.3 0.5% decrease in rates 0.6 0.6 The methods and assumptions used to calculate the possible effect of a change in interest rates are consistent with those used in the prior year.
Currency risk and sensitivity As a Pan-European business a proportion of the Groups activities are denominated in currencies other than sterling, principally the euro.
However, the transactional exposure of the Group is minimised as the vast majority of transactions are denominated in the relevant functional currency of the operation concerned.
In order to protect the sterling value of the balance sheet, the Group generally finances its investment in overseas subsidiaries by borrowing in the applicable currency.
Consequently, any change in the value of a currency against sterling with all other variables held constant has no material impact on the net assets of the Group.
The only exception is the Groups net investment in Hungary which is financed in sterling: a 5% change in the sterling Hungarian forint exchange rate would have a 0.5m impact on the Groups net assets.
A variation of 5% represents managements view of a reasonably possible change in the sterling Hungarian forint exchange rate.
79 Wincanton plc Annual Report 2008 notes to the consoliDateD financial statements continued Although a proportion of non-sterling funding is obtained by borrowing euro and other currencies directly from the Groups committed facilities, a large element results from swapping the US$150m private placement into sterling, and then from sterling into euros.
The underlying US$150m principal and all future cash flows are fully hedged: the fair values of the US$ principal, and the US$ GBP swap move in line with each other, so there is no resulting adjustment to the Groups income statement.
The GBP euro swap is used as part of the Groups net investment hedge, whereby changes in the value of the Groups net investment in euro are offset by changes in the value of the swap.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
The Group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Deposits are only made with preapproved counterparties.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit.
The Group does not generally require collateral in respect of financial assets.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet of 455.9m 2007: 400.1m.
See note 17 for further analysis of trade receivables and the associated impairment provisions held.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Groups net debt at the balance sheet date was: 2008 2007 m m Total borrowings 171.9 126.7 Cash and cash equivalents 67.4 60.9 Net debt 104.5 65.8 Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are given in the following table: 2008 2007 Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value m m m m Unlisted trade investments 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Trade receivables 297.5 297.5 255.2 255.2 Other receivables 9.9 9.9 8.1 8.1 Cash and cash equivalents 67.4 67.4 60.9 60.9 Forward exchange contracts Assets 81.1 81.1 75.9 75.9 Liabilities 98.6 98.6 86.7 86.7 Bank loans and overdrafts 59.3 59.3 36.3 36.3 Unsecured bond issues US$ private placement 81.1 81.1 75.9 75.9 Finance lease liabilities 14.0 14.0 3.7 3.7 Trade and other payables 521.6 521.6 449.1 449.1 Unrecognised losses 80 Wincanton plc Annual Report 2008 Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the above table.
Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
For interest rate swaps broker quotes are used.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings and unsecured bond issues Fair value is calculated on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows at market interest rates.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogenous lease agreements.
29 Related parties Identity of related parties The Group has a controlling related party relationship with its parent company Wincanton plc.
