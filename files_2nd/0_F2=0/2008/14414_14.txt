Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 General information SOCO International plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on page 75.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 6 and in the Review of Operations and Financial Review on pages 12 to 21 and 22 to 25, respectively.
2 Significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and on a going concern basis of accounting for the reasons set out in the Directors Report on page 37 and in the Financial Review on page 25.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the valuation of hydrocarbon inventory and the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of each of the Companys subsidiary undertakings.
The functional currency of the Company remains GB pounds although its financial statements are presented in US dollars.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
During 2008, the Group changed the way in which it values physical inventory of hydrocarbons to follow established industry practice whereby such inventory is valued at net realisable value NRV rather than at the lower of cost or NRV.
No prior year adjustment has been made on the grounds of immateriality.
b Adoption of new and revised accounting standards At the date of approval of these financial statements the Group has not applied the following IFRSs, International Accounting Standards IAS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations which are in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 1 amended IAS 27 Amended Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate IFRS2 amended Share-based Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations IFRS 3 revised 2008 Business Combinations IFRS 8 Operating Segments IAS 1 revised 2007 Presentation of Financial Statements IAS 23 revised 2007 Borrowing Costs IAS 27 revised 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 32 amended IAS 1 amended Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners The adoption of these IASs, IFRSs and IFRICs in future periods are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
c Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of SOCO International plc and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the balance sheet date.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method whereby the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and the consideration given are recognised in the Group accounts at their fair values as at the date of the acquisition.
d Investments Except as stated below, non-current investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
e Interests in joint ventures Jointly controlled entities are those for which the Group exercises joint control over the operating and financial policies.
These investments are dealt with by proportionate consolidation whereby the consolidated financial statements include the appropriate share of these companies assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line by line basis.
Where a consolidated member of the Group participates in unincorporated joint ventures, that member accounts directly for its share of the jointly controlled assets, liabilities and related income and expenses which are then similarly included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
f Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and no depreciation is charged.
56 SOCO International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financials Financials Financials Financials 2 Significant accounting policies continued g Revenue Revenue represents the fair value of the Groups share of oil and gas sold during the year on an entitlement basis.
To the extent revenue arises from test production during an evaluation programme, an amount is charged from evaluation costs to cost of sales so as to reflect a zero net margin.
Investment revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
h Tangible and intangible non-current assets Oil and gas exploration, evaluation and development expenditure The Group uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration, evaluation and development expenditure, whereby all expenditures incurred in connection with the acquisition, exploration, evaluation and development of oil and gas assets, including directly attributable overheads, interest payable and exchange differences directly related to financing development projects, are capitalised in separate geographical cost pools.
Cost pools are established on the basis of geographical area having regard to the operational and financial organisation of the Group.
Intangible acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs incurred in a geographical area where the Group has no established cost pool are initially capitalised as intangible non-current assets except where they fall outside the scope of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources whereby they are expensed as incurred subject to other guidance under IFRS.
Tangible non-current assets used in acquisition, exploration and evaluation are classified with tangible non-current assets as property, plant and equipment.
To the extent that such tangible assets are consumed in exploration and evaluation the amount reflecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset.
Upon successful conclusion of the appraisal programme and determination that commercial reserves exist, such costs are transferred to tangible non-current assets as property, plant and equipment.
Exploration and evaluation costs carried forward are assessed for impairment as described below.
Proceeds from the disposal of oil and gas assets are credited against the relevant cost centre.
Any overall surplus arising in a cost centre is credited to the income statement.
Depreciation and depletion Depletion is provided on oil and gas assets in production using the unit of production method, based on proven and probable reserves, applied to the sum of the total capitalised exploration, evaluation and development costs, together with estimated future development costs at current prices.
Oil and gas assets which have a similar economic life are aggregated for depreciation purposes.
Impairment of value Where there has been a change in economic conditions or in the expected use of an asset that indicates a possible impairment in an asset, management tests the recoverability of the net book value of the asset by comparison with the estimated discounted future net cash flows based on managements expectations of future oil prices and future costs.
Any identified impairment is charged to the income statement.
Intangible non-current assets are considered for impairment at least annually by reference to the indicators in IFRS 6.
Where there is an indication of impairment of an exploration and evaluation asset which is within a geographic pool where the Group has tangible oil and gas assets with commercial reserves, the exploration asset is assessed for impairment together with all other cash generating units and related tangible and intangible assets in that geographic pool and any balance remaining after impairment is amortised over the proven and probable reserves of the pool.
Where the exploration asset is in an area where the Group has no established pool, the exploration asset is tested for impairment separately and, where determined to be impaired, is written off.
Other tangible non-current assets Other tangible non-current assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost of those assets, less residual value, over their expected useful lives.
Decommissioning The decommissioning provision is calculated as the net present value of the Groups share of the expenditure which may be incurred at the end of the producing life of each field in the removal and decommissioning of the production, storage and transportation facilities currently in place.
The cost of recognising the decommissioning provision is included as part of the cost of the relevant property, plant and equipment and is thus charged to the income statement on a unit of production basis in accordance with the Groups policy for depletion and depreciation of tangible non-current assets.
Period charges for changes in the net present value of the decommissioning provision arising from discounting are included in finance costs.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 SOCO International plc 57 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued i Changes in estimates The effects of changes in estimates on the unit of production calculations are accounted for prospectively over the estimated remaining proven and probable reserves of each pool.
j Inventories Inventories, except for inventories of hydrocarbons, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Physical inventories of hydrocarbons, which are held for trading purposes, are valued at net realisable value and recorded as inventory.
Underlifts and overlifts are valued at market value and are included in prepayments and accrued income and accruals and deferred income, respectively.
Changes in hydrocarbon inventories, underlifts and overlifts are adjusted through cost of sales.
k Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
l Share-based payments In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 to all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
Under these requirements, equity-settled awards under share-based incentive plans are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the performance period along with a corresponding increase in equity.
Fair value is measured using an option pricing model taking into consideration managements best estimate of the expected life of the option and the estimated number of shares that will eventually vest.
m Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to recover the asset.
Deferred tax is not recognised where an asset or liability is acquired in a transaction which is not a business combination for an amount which differs from its tax value.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
n Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group does not currently utilise derivative financial instruments.
Other than the convertible bonds there are no material financial assets and liabilities for which differences between carrying amounts and fair values are required to be disclosed.
The classification of financial instruments as required by IFRS 7 is disclosed in Notes 18, 21, 22 and 23.
Financial asset at fair value through profit or loss Where a financial instrument is classified as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss it is initially recognised at fair value.
At each balance sheet date the fair value is reviewed and any gain or loss arising is recognised in the income statement.
Period credits for changes in the net present value of the financial asset arising from discounting are included in other gains and losses.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
58 SOCO International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financials Financials Financials Financials 2 Significant accounting policies continued Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Convertible bonds The net proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds are split between a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue.
The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity and is not remeasured.
The liability component is carried at amortised cost.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar nonconvertible debt to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bonds.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
o Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are stated in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
Transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date, or if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Any resulting gains and losses are included in net profit or loss for the period.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements the results of entities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on retranslation at the closing rate of the opening net assets and results of entities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are dealt with through equity and transferred to the Groups retained earnings reserve.
p Pension costs The contributions payable in the year in respect of pension costs for defined contribution schemes and other post-retirement benefits are charged to the income statement.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown either as accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
3 Financial risk management The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing financial risks that may affect the Group.
In certain cases the Board delegates responsibility for such reviews and policy setting to the Audit Committee.
The main financial risks affecting the Group are discussed below: Credit risk The Groups non-current financial asset that is subject to credit risk comprises a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss arising in respect of the Groups disposal of its Mongolia interest see Note 18.
The Groups and Companys other financial assets comprise investments, trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
The Group seeks to minimise credit risk by only maintaining balances with creditworthy third parties including major multi-national oil companies subject to contractual terms in respect of trade receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited as the Board only selects institutions with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and endeavours to spread cash balances over more than one institution.
The level of deposits held by different institutions is regularly reviewed.
Foreign currency risk The Group primarily conducts and manages its business in US dollars.
Cash balances in Group subsidiaries are usually held in US dollars, but smaller amounts may be held in GB pounds or local currencies to meet immediate operating or administrative expenses, or to comply with local currency regulations.
From time to time the Group may take short term hedging positions to protect the value of any cash balances it holds in non-US dollar currencies.
The impact of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates on the Groups profit and net assets for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 2007 would not have been material.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 SOCO International plc 59 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3 Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Groups cash requirements and balances are projected for the Group as a whole and for each country in which operations and capital expenditures are conducted.
The Group meets these requirements through an appropriate mix of available funds, equity instruments and debt financing.
The Groups ability to satisfy its debt obligations and to pursue its operational objectives are discussed in the Risk Management section of the Financial Review.
The Group seeks to minimise the impact that any debt financings have on its balance sheet by negotiating borrowings in matching currencies see Notes 23 and 30.
The Group further mitigates liquidity risk by entering into arrangements with industry partners thereby sharing costs and risks, and by maintaining an insurance programme to minimise exposure to insurable losses.
Interest rate risk The Group earns interest on its cash at bank and other short term highly liquid investments at a floating rate see Note 29.
Fixed rate interest is charged on the Groups convertible bonds see Note 23.
In addition the Group had a reserve-based revolving credit facility which was subject to a floating rate, however no drawdowns were made.
During the year the Group entered into an unsecured revolving term facility which was subject to a floating rate, drawing down $20.0 million which was subsequently repaid.
Both facilities were cancelled during the year see Note 30.
The fair value of the Groups non-current financial asset see Note 18 is also dependent on the discount rate used.
Management assess the Groups sensitivity to changes in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher or lower and all other variables held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended, and its net assets at, 31 December 2008 would decrease or increase by $2.5 million 2007 $1.2 million or $1.3 million, respectively.
Commodity price risk The Groups production is usually sold on spot or near term contracts, with prices fixed at the time of a transfer of custody or on the basis of a monthly average market price.
However the Board may give consideration in certain circumstances to the appropriateness of entering into fixed price, long term marketing contracts.
Although oil prices may fluctuate widely, it is the Groups policy not to hedge crude oil sales unless hedging is required to mitigate financial risks associated with debt financing of its assets or to meet its commitments.
Over time, during periods when the Group sees an opportunity to lock in attractive oil prices, it may engage in limited price hedging.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt see Note 23, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 25 and 26.
4 Critical judgements and accounting estimates a Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies described in Note 2, management has made judgements that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
These are discussed below: Oil and gas assets Note 2 h describes the judgements necessary to implement the Groups policy with respect to the carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets and tangible property, plant and equipment.
Management considers these assets for impairment at least annually with reference to indicators in IFRS 6 and IAS 36, respectively.
Note 15 discloses the carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets and Note 16 discloses the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.
Further, Note 2 h describes the Groups policy regarding reclassification of intangible assets to tangible assets.
Management considers the appropriateness of asset classification at least annually.
Financial asset Note 2 n describes the accounting policy with respect to financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The key judgements that are used in calculating the fair value of the Groups financial asset arising on the disposal of its Mongolia interest are described in Note 18 and are reviewed at least annually.
The only market risk assumption that has a significant impact on the fair value of this asset is the discount rate, as described in Note 3.
Convertible bonds Note 2 n sets out the Groups accounting policy on convertible bonds.
Management assesses the fair value of the liability component at issue and reviews the appropriateness of the amortisation period at least annually.
Note 2 h describes the nature of the costs that the Group capitalises which include applicable borrowing costs that are directly attributable to qualifying assets as defined in IAS 23 Borrowing Costs IAS 23.
Management has considered the definition of qualifying assets in IAS 23 and has determined that the only expenditure that currently meets the definition is that related to the Groups interests in Vietnam.
Consequently the interest associated with capital expenditure in Vietnam has been capitalised up to the date at which such qualifying assets enter into production.
60 SOCO International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financials Financials Financials Financials 4 Critical judgements and accounting estimates continued b Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below: Oil and gas reserves Note 2 h sets out the Groups accounting policy on depreciation and depletion.
Proven and probable reserves are estimated using standard recognised evaluation techniques.
The estimate is reviewed at least twice a year and is regularly reviewed by independent consultants.
Future development costs are estimated taking into account the level of development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that impact the fair value of the Groups financial asset arising on the disposal of its Mongolia interest are described in Note 18 and are reviewed at least annually.
Decommissioning provision The accounting policy for decommissioning is discussed in Note 2 h. The cost of decommissioning is estimated by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
Further details are provided in Note 24.
5 Total revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2008 2007 $000s $000s Continuing operations Oil sales see Note 6 55,340 Investment revenue 7,175 5,916 62,515 5,916 Discontinued operations Oil sales see Note 6 43,984 98,420 Investment revenue 107 410 106,606 104,746 6 Segment information Geographical segments Geographical segments form the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 SOCO International plc 61 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 6 Segment information continued Business segment The Group has one principal business activity being oil and gas exploration and production.
Revenue by destination does not materially differ from revenue by origin.
There are no inter-segment sales.
7 Other gains and losses 2008 2007 $000s $000s Change in fair value of financial asset see Note 18 1,634 177 Exchange loss gain 146 69 1,488 246 8 Finance costs 2008 2007 $000s $000s Interest payable in respect of convertible bonds see Note 23 15,401 15,111 Other interest payable and similar fees see Note 30 509 205 Capitalised finance costs 14,607 8,152 Unwinding of discount on provisions see Note 24 144 1,447 7,164 The amount of finance costs capitalised was determined by applying the weighted average rate of finance costs applicable to the borrowings of the Group of 6.55% 2007 6.55% to the expenditures on the qualifying asset see Note 4.
9 Profit for the year Profit for the year is stated after charging fees payable to the Companys auditors: 2008 2007 $000s $000s Audit of the Companys annual accounts 177 127 Audit of the Companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 11 38 Other services pursuant to legislation 73 75 Recruitment and remuneration services 65 104 Corporate finance services 101 Other services: Audit of the Companys subsidiaries, not required by legislation 28 Other 17 15 Total fees 444 387 The amounts payable to Deloitte LLP by the Group in respect of other services pursuant to legislation comprise $73,000 relating to the Groups interim review 2007 $75,000.
The amount payable in respect of corporate finance services relates to reporting accountant work required in connection with the disposal of the Groups Yemen interest see Note 12.
Fees payable to Deloitte LLP for non-audit services to the Company are not required to be disclosed separately because the consolidated financial statements disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
62 SOCO International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financials Financials Financials Financials 10 Staff costs The average monthly number of employees of the Group including Executive Directors was 14 2007 14, of which 11 2007 11 were administrative personnel and 3 2007 3 were operations personnel.
The average monthly number of employees directly contracted to the Company was 8 2007 8 of which 7 2007 7 were administrative personnel and 1 2007 1 was operations personnel.
Their aggregate remuneration comprised: Group Company | 2008 2007 2008 2007 $000s $000s $000s $000s Wages and salaries 5,454 5,556 1,858 1,466 Social security costs 1,833 2,183 196 167 Share-based payment expense see Note 28 971 834 59 63 Other pension costs under money purchase schemes 470 430 135 116 8,728 9,003 2,248 1,812 A proportion of the Groups staff costs are capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Taxation in other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
During 2008 and 2007 both current and deferred taxation have arisen in overseas jurisdictions only.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: 2008 2007 $000s $000s Profit before tax on continuing operations 37,388 8,860 Profit before tax on discontinued operations 393,213 65,933 Profit before tax 430,601 57,073 Profit before tax multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28.5% 2007 30% 122,721 17,122 Effects of: Non-taxable income and non-deductible expenses 8,037 2,779 Non-taxable profit on disposal 101,656 Higher tax rates on overseas earnings 6,515 3,580 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous years 2 1,278 Tax charge for the year 19,541 24,759 The tax charge in future periods may also be affected by these factors.
The Groups overseas tax rates are higher than those in the UK, primarily because the profits earned in Vietnam and Thailand are taxed at a rate of 50% and in Yemen are taxed at a rate of 35%.
12 Discontinued operations In February 2008, the Group entered into a conditional sale agreement to dispose of its wholly owned subsidiary SOCO Yemen Pty Limited SOCO Yemen, the entity that held the Companys interest in the East Shabwa Development Area ESDA in Yemen, to Sinochem Petroleum Limited Sinochem.
The disposal was completed in April 2008 for $465.0 million, subject to certain financial adjustments the Disposal.
The consideration for the Disposal was paid in cash on completion.
SOCO Yemen held an indirect interest of 16.785% in the ESDA of Yemen through its 58.75% equity interest in Comeco Petroleum, Inc. Comeco.
Comeco, in turn, had a 28.57% interest in the ESDA.
The ESDA joint venture is operated by TOTAL E&P Yemen under a production sharing agreement with the Government of Yemen.
The Groups interest in the ESDA in Yemen was the only component of the Middle East segment disclosed in Note 6.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 SOCO International plc 63 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 12 Discontinued operations continued The results of the Groups discontinued Yemen interest is shown on the consolidated income statement and in Note 6.
Net operating cash flows from discontinued operations are shown in Note 29.
During the period to the date of disposal the cash used in investing activities was $9.6 million 2007 $41.1 million and cash used in financing activities was $7.8 million 2007 $11.2 million.
Immediately prior to the sale the Groups share of net assets associated with the Yemen interest was $102.5 million 2007 $86.6 million comprising property, plant and equipment of $96.8 million 2007 $86.8 million, current assets of $27.2 million 2007 $16.9 million, current liabilities of $8.5 million 2007 $8.2 million and long term liabilities of $13.0 million 2007 $8.9 million.
Upon completion the Group recognised cash inflow of $438.5 million reflecting the $465.0 million cash consideration net of the Groups share of cash held by the Yemen interest of $20.7 million, transaction costs of $5.3 million and financial adjustments of $0.5 million, and a gain of $356.7 million.
13 Profit attributable to SOCO International plc The profit for the financial year, inclusive of dividends received from subsidiary undertakings, dealt with in the accounts of the Company was $459,358,000 2007 $5,087,000.
As provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no income statement is presented in respect of the Company.
14 Earnings per share The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: 2008 2007 $000s $000s Earnings loss from continuing operations 30,573 8,882 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Interest on convertible bonds see Note 8 794 Earnings loss for the purposes of diluted earnings per share on continuing operations 31,367 8,882 Earnings from discontinued operations 380,487 41,196 Earnings for the purposes of diluted earnings per share on continuing and discontinued operations 411,854 32,314 Number of shares 2008 2007 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 71,446,122 70,491,970 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Share options and warrants 3,065,499 6,405,279 Ordinary shares of the Company held by the Group see Note 26 2,113,936 2,193,280 Convertible bonds see Note 23 6,238,000 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 82,863,557 79,090,529 At 31 December 2007 up to 6,238,000 potential ordinary shares in the Company that are underlying the Companys convertible bonds see Note 23 and that may dilute earnings per share in the future were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were antidilutive for that year.

The remaining consideration is payable, once cumulative production reaches 27.8 million barrels of oil, at the rate of 20% of the average monthly posted marker price for Daqing crude multiplied by the aggregate production for that month, up to a total of $52.7 million.
The subsequent payment amount is included in non-current assets as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.
The timescale for the production of crude oil in excess of 27.8 million barrels and the price of Daqing marker crude oil are factors that cannot accurately be predicted.
However, based upon the Directors current estimates of proven and probable reserves from the Mongolia interests and the development scenarios as discussed with the buyer, the Directors believe that the full subsequent payment amount will be payable.
The fair value of the subsequent payment amount was determined using a valuation technique as there is no active market against which direct comparisons can be made.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair value include the factors mentioned above, risked as appropriate, with the resultant cash flows discounted at a commercial risk free interest rate.
The fair value of the financial asset at the date of completion of the sale was $31.5 million.
As at 31 December 2008 the fair value was $34.4 million 2007 $32.7 million after accounting for the change in fair value see Note 7.

Awards are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the award vests.
Certain additional awards are outstanding and exercisable which were granted prior to the introduction of the LTIP.
Awards normally expire at the end of 10 years following the date of grant, subject to the requirement to exercise certain awards prior to 15 March of the year following vesting.
Awards would normally be equity-settled through a transfer at nil consideration of the Companys own ordinary shares Shares held by the Trust see Note 26.
