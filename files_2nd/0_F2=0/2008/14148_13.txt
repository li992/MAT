At a meeting of the Committee on 27 May 2008 the performance conditions for the financial year ended 31 March 2008 were determined to have been achieved, resulting in the vesting in full of the LTIPs granted in 2005.

Share Option Schemes The Committee believes that share ownership by employees encourages the matching of long term interests between employees and shareholders.
All UK employees including Executive Directors, subject to certain service conditions, may participate in HM Revenue & Customs approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS.
Senior executives were also able to participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Grants of options under the ESOS were discontinued in August 2005 when this scheme was replaced by the LTIP.
Under the terms of the SRSOS for UK employees, options may be granted during the ten year period to July 2015 to acquire up to 10% of the issued equity share capital of the Company, including options granted under the ESOS and LTIP.
Options are granted at the higher of the nominal value of an ordinary 10 pence share and an amount determined by the Remuneration Committee being not less than 80% of the market value.
Employees held options over nearly 0.7m shares under the SRSOS as at 31 March 2008.
At the AGM held on 26 July 2007 the shareholders approved an amendment to the SRSOS rules to extend the dates upon which invitations to apply for share options could be made to employees to include the period forty two days commencing from the AGM.
Under the terms of the discontinued ESOS, options could be granted during the ten year period to August 2005 to acquire up to 5% of the issued equity share capital of the Company.
The exercise of options granted under the ESOS, is subject to a performance condition, achievement of which is a pre-requisite for exercise of options.
The condition is tested once only after a period of three years and if it is not achieved the relevant options will lapse.
Options granted after 26 July 2001 will only be exercisable if the Groups EPS, calculated on a consistent basis, exceeds the growth in Retail Price Index over the same period by at least nine percentage points.
During the year the Committee confirmed the performance conditions for the ESOS granted in 2004 had been met and therefore was available for exercise.
At a meeting of the Committee on 27 May 2008 the performance conditions for the financial year ended 31 March 2008 were determined to have been achieved resulting in the vesting of the final tranche of executive options granted in 2005. shanks.
annual report 2008 35 remuneration report continued The Remuneration Committee applied a different performance condition for options granted under the ESOS prior to 26 July 2001.
These options may not be exercised unless the growth in the Groups EPS over the period of any three consecutive years after the date of grant equals or exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period by at least six percentage points.
During the year the Committee re-tested the performance conditions for the ESOS granted in 2000 and 2001 and confirmed these had been achieved and as a result these options were available for exercise.
Directors Service Contracts and Notice Periods The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the policy with regard to the notice period for Executive Directors is one year.
Accordingly, Mr T Drury and Mr F Welham have rolling service contracts dated 3 September 2007 and 21 July 2005, respectively, which require one years notice from the Company.
In the case of notice from the Director, Mr T Drury is required to give one years notice and Mr F Welham, six months.
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will consider carefully what compensation should be paid taking into account the circumstances of the particular case.
As has been detailed in the Directors Report, Mr Averill stood down from his position as Group Chief Executive and Director with effect from 30 September 2007.
However, in line with his notice period Mr Averill continued to be employed by the Company on an advisory basis until the end of May 2008.
Payments from that date were limited to the Directors contractual remuneration including basic salary and benefits for the unexpired portion of the notice period, being a salary of 187,000 and car allowance medical insurance benefit of 14,000 for the period 1 October 2007 to 31 March 2008.
Any entitlement to the exercise of LTIPs awarded previously is governed by the rules of the relevant scheme.
Pensionable service is accrued for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts as their terms of engagement are governed by letters of appointment.
Mr P Delaunois had and, post his retirement from the Board in July 2007, continues to have an agreement to provide consultancy services to the Groups Belgian subsidiary companies which can be terminated on giving three months notice by either party.

Executive directors are limited to hold one such position and the policy is that fees may be retained by the Director, reflecting the personal risk assumed in such appointments.
Mr M Averill had Board approval for two Non-executive positions during his last year in office.
The fees received from these appointments until his retirement from the Board were 35,000.

In the case of Mr Welham, pension benefits are capped at the notional HM Revenue & Customs earnings cap, which is reviewed annually.
For the year to 31 March 2008 the notional cap was 112,800.

iii The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service at the end of the year.
iv The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The calculation is based on the assumption that pensions will be paid from the earliest retirement age possible without the application of actuarial reduction factors at age of 57 for Mr M Averill and 62 for Mr F Welham.
Mr Averill resigned as a Director on 30 September 2007.
His transfer value has been calculated on his pensionable pay as at 30 September 2007.
He remained a member of the Scheme to the year end, and the increase in accrued pension and transfer value reflects accrual of benefits over the whole year.
v The increase in transfer value has been calculated taking into account market conditions and the Directors ages at 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2008.
