Share-based payments 2005 Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP, senior executives can receive conditional awards of rights over whole shares worth up to 200% of salary p. a.
The awards granted in 2008 under the PSP vest subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR based performance condition under which the Companys TSR performance is measured over a fixed three-year period against both the constituents of an Index and a comparator group of oil and gas companies.
For awards from March 2008 the index is the FTSE 100 index excluding investments trusts : for awards before March 2008, the index is the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts.
Half of an award is tested against the Index and the other half against the comparator group.
The test is over a three-year period starting on 1 January prior to grant, and an individual must normally remain in employment for three years from the date of grant for the shares to vest.
No dividends are paid to participants over the vesting period.
Further details in relation to the PSP award measurements are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.

Share-based payments continued 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The only share option scheme operated by the Group during the year was the 2000 ESOS.
Options granted under the 2000 ESOS normally only become exercisable following the third anniversary of the date of the grant if the performance condition has been met.
The condition requires that the Companys TRS performance over a fixed three-year period must exceed the median company in the constituents of an index.
For awards granted from March 2008 the index is the FTSE 100 index excluding investments trusts : for awards before March 2008 the index is the FTSE 250 index excluding investments trusts.
100% of the awards will vest if the Companys TSR is above the median of the respective index over the three-year period following grant.
Options awarded under the 2000 ESOS before 24 May 2005 are subject to monthly re-testing on a rolling three-year basis if the TSR performance criterion is not met.
Options granted on or after 24 May 2005 are not subject to monthly re-testing.
Options have previously been granted under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS.
Options granted under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS were made prior to 7 November 2002 and therefore, under the FRS transitional provisions, they have not been accounted for in accordance with FRS 20 Share-based payments.

Options outstanding at 31 December 2008 had exercise prices of 61p to 754.0p and remaining contractual lives of one to 10 years.
