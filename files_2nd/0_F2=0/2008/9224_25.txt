Annual Report and Accounts 2008 101 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Pensions The Company is the principal employer of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, a funded defined benefit group plan.
The pension cost relating to the plan is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected credit unit method.
Any actuarial gains or losses arising are taken to equity in the period in which they arise.
Any past service costs are recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise are amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits are vested.
The defined benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of defined benefit obligations adjusted for any unrecognised past service costs.
If necessary, the net defined benefit surplus is limited to the amount which can be recovered through reduced Company contributions in the future plus any refunds that have been agreed at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using a binomial model, further details of which are given in note 34 of the consolidated IFRS financial statements.
In valuing equitysettled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date, based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
ESOP trusts Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an ESOP trust these shares are shown as a reduction in equity.
Any consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds and no gain or loss is recognised within the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses on the purchase, sale or cancellation of these shares.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments that are reacquired treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own equity instruments.
Share buybacks in the close period During the close period, the period between the year end and the preliminary annual results announcement, the Company is prevented from purchasing its own shares by the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules, except under certain allowed contingent purchase agreements with third parties.
In accordance with FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, a financial liability is recognised when the Company enters into such an agreement, representing the purchase price of the shares the Company may be required to purchase.

The Company received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation HHC, at the time of the hotels division disposal, in relation to any loss the Company may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees.
The maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees is 943.1 million 2007: 1,228.1 million, with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount.
Included in the maximum liability exposure is 528.5 million 2007: 539.9 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 414.6 million 2007: 688.2 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Company has entered.
These guarantees expire between 2009 and 2042 and the net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2008 is 430.1 million 2007: 635.8 million.
Included in the net present value of the maximum exposure is 219.1 million 2007: 227.1 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 211.0 million 2007: 408.7 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Company monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations.
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.
The financial guarantee asset has been valued on a similar basis to the liability, taking account of the credit profile of the counter party, HHC, to assess the likelihood of HHC continuing to be solvent at the time of any future potential claim under the indemnity.
At 31 December 2008, the Company has recognised a financial liability of 9.0 million 2007: 10.0 million in respect of these guarantees together with a financial asset of nil 2007: 3.0 million in relation to the indemnity.

The latest formal actuarial valuation of the plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 September 2007.
The results of the actuarial valuation were updated to 31 December 2008 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with FRS 17.
The defined benefit obligations and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.
The following table sets out the key FRS 17 assumptions used for the plan.
The table also sets out as at 31 December 2008, 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006, the fair value of assets, a breakdown of the assets into the main asset classes, the present value of the FRS 17 liabilities, the surplus or deficit of assets compared to the FRS 17 liabilities, the related deferred tax liability or asset and the net pension asset or liability.

The currently agreed level of employer contributions is 20.5% of pensionable payroll, plus an additional 133,333 per month to remove the shortfall in funding identified at 30 September 2007 and 62,500 per month towards the regular expenses of maintaining the plan.
These lead to an expected contribution of 7.4 million in 2009.
As the plan is closed to new entrants and, under the method used to calculate pension costs in accordance with FRS 17, the service cost as a percentage of covered pensionable payroll will tend to increase over time as the average age of the membership increases.
