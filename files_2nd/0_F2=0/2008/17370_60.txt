i exchange adjustments on foreign currency net investments of 1,379.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: 68.7 million, 2006: 352.3 million largely arises from the retranslation at year-end exchange rates of the Groups opening, non-sterling assets and liabilities.
During 2008 the uS dollar and the euro strengthened against sterling by over 26% and 23% respectively.
this had a significant impact on the Groups balance sheet and the amount taken into equity in respect of the retranslation of net assets.
ii the actuarial loss on defined benefit pension schemes of 82.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: gain of 30.0 million, 2006: gain of 11.3 million was largely due to a decrease in pension scheme asset values in 2008 and reflects the deterioration in the global economic environment during the year.
Approximately 58.0 million or 70% of this actuarial loss arose on the Groups pension plans in north America.
