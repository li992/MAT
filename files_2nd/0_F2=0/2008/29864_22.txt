Following the outcome in a recent European Court of Justice Case, HM Revenue and Customs HMRC has now accepted that management fees charged to Investment Trusts can be treated as exempt for Value Added Tax VAT purposes.
The Company has also lodged protective claims with HMRC to recover VAT previously overpaid by it.
However, it is generally acknowledged that the resolution of retrospective claims is likely to be complex and may not occur for some time.
HMRC has recently issued some guidance in principle on how it views such claims should be settled but also reaffirms that claims will be considered on a case by case basis.
As such, the eventful outcome of the claims cannot be accurately predicted at this time.
No credit has been taken into these accounts for any amounts that may be recoverable.
