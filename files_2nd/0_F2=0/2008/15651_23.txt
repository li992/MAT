FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements 1.
General information Thomas Cook Group plc is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985 and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office is The Thomas Cook Business Park, Coningsby Road, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, PE3 8SB.
The principal activities of the Group are discussed in the Business review on pages 2 to 47.
These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 19 December 2008.
The Directors consider that Arcandor AG is the Companys ultimate controlling party.
The largest and smallest group of undertakings for which consolidated financial statements are prepared and which include the financial statements of the Thomas Cook Group is that headed by Arcandor AG.
Arcandor AG is incorporated in Germany and copies of its financial statements, which are publicly available, may be obtained from Arcandor AG, Theodor-Althoff-Str.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations that are expected to impact on the Group but which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective.
IAS 1 Revised Presentation of financial statements, revised version issued in January 2008, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This changes the presentation requirements for other comprehensive income and transactions with shareholders, and requires increased disclosures when there is a restatement of comparatives.
Adopting this standard will not affect the recognition, measurement or disclosure of any transactions or events.
IAS 23 Amendment Borrowing costs, revised version issued in March 2007, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This eliminates the option of expensing all borrowing costs when they are incurred and is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.
IAS 32 Amendment Financial instruments: Presentation, issued in February 2008, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This clarifies the treatment of puttable financial instruments.
The adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.
IAS 27 Revised Consolidated and separate financial statements, issued January 2008, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
This will require a different accounting treatment for minority interest but it is not expected to affect the Groups financial results or position materially.
IFRS 2 Amendment Share based payments, issued January 2008, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This provides a definition of vesting conditions and specifies the accounting treatment for non-vesting conditions.
It is not expected to materially affect the share-based payment charge recognised in the Group accounts.
IFRS 3 Revised Business combinations, issued January 2008, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
This will significantly change the recognition of goodwill, acquisition costs and contingent consideration relating to acquisitions.
However, it only applies to acquisitions made after it has been adopted.
IFRS 8 Operating segments, issued in November 2006, effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This may change the way in which we report operating segments.
A detailed review of the impact of this standard is currently in progress.
IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements, issued in December 2006, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008.
A detailed review of the impact of this interpretation is in progress.
IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes, issued in June 2007, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008.
A detailed review of the impact of this interpretation is currently in progress.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction, issued in July 2007, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, issued July 2007, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008.
The Group will also perform a detailed review of the annual improvements project published by the International Accounting Standards Board in May 2008.
Accounting policies These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to groups reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial period except that the Group has adopted IFRS 7: Financial instruments: Disclosures and the amendment to IAS 1: Presentation of financial statements.
Adoption of these standards has required additional disclosures on the credit quality of trade receivables, financial risks and capital management.
IFRIC 11: Group and treasury share transactions came into effect in the current period, however the interpretation had no impact on the Group.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for revaluation of certain financial instruments and investment property.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial information presented in this document are set out below.
These policies have been applied consistently to the periods presented.
Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 73 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Basis of preparation During the period, we changed the presentational currency for the Group to sterling as we now expect to generate the majority of our profits in non-euro countries, with the UK being by far the largest.
Accordingly, the prior period comparatives are re-presented in sterling.
The prior period comparatives for assets and liabilities were translated at the sterling to euro period end exchange rate 1.4346.
The prior period comparatives for equity and income statement items were translated at the sterling to euro exchange rate on the date of the transactions.
During the period, the prior year was restated for fair value adjustments related to the MyTravel Group plc acquisition.
The determination of fair values related to the MyTravel Group plc acquisition has now been concluded.
Refer to note 17 of the Group financial statements for further details.
During the period, the year end of the Group was changed from 31 October to 30 September.
As a result, the current financial period results are for eleven months and are not comparable with the prior year numbers.
The Groups financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method.
Where a transaction is a business combination amongst entities under common control, the requirements of IFRS 3 are applied.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Where audited financial accounts are not coterminous with those of the Group, the financial information has been derived from the last audited accounts available and unaudited management accounts for the period up to the Companys balance sheet date.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Interpretation guidance included within SIC Interpretation 12: Consolidation special purpose entities indicates that certain special purpose entities SPEs, which are involved in aircraft leasing and other arrangements with the Group, should be interpreted as controlled by the Group, and therefore subject to consolidation, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
As a consequence, the Group has consolidated twelve SPEs.
Associates and joint ventures Entities, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group exerts significant influence, but not control or joint control, are associates.
Entities which the Group jointly controls with one or more other party under a contractual arrangement are joint ventures.
The Groups share of the results of associates and joint ventures is included in the Group income statement using the equity accounting method.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are included in the Group balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the entity, and including any goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provided evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Other non-current asset investments The fair value of investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are measured using an appropriate valuation technique.
Where a fair value cannot be reliably measured, the investment is measured at cost.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Any impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset, and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Groups income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
The allocation of goodwill is made to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The Group allocates goodwill to each segment in which it operates.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets other Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are carried on the Groups balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised.
For all other intangible assets, amortisation is charged on a straight line basis over the assets useful life, as follows: Brands 10 years to indefinite life Customer relationship 1 to 12 years Computer software 3 to 10 years Other acquired intangible assets are assessed separately and useful lives established according to the particular circumstances.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inflows.
These are considered to have an indefinite life given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support.
The nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported by advertising and marketing spend.
com FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing their carrying amount to their recoverable amount.
All other intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date for indications of impairment.
If such indications exist, the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Except for investment property, property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of straight line depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Where costs are incurred as part of the start-up or commissioning of an item of property, plant or equipment, and that item is available for use but incapable of operating in the manner intended by management without such a start-up or commissioning period, then such costs are included within the cost of the item.
Costs that are not directly attributable to bringing an asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and investment property, upon which no depreciation is provided, is calculated on a straight line basis and aims to write down their cost to their estimated residual value over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 40 to 50 years Leasehold properties Shorter of remaining lease period and 40 years New aircraft 12 to 20 years or remaining lease period if shorter Aircraft spares 5 to 15 years or remaining lease period if shorter Other fixed assets 3 to 15 years Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
Investment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long-term rental yields and capital growth.
It is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Investment property is valued annually by external qualified professional valuers in the countries concerned.
In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal valuation is performed and adjustments made to reflect any material changes in fair value.
Non-current assets held for sale The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
To be classified as held for sale, the assets must be available for immediate sale in their present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for the sale of such assets, and their sale must be highly probable.
Sale is considered to be highly probable when management are committed to a plan to sell the assets and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated, at a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value, and there is an expectation that the sale will be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are carried on the Groups balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Aircraft overhaul and maintenance costs The cost of major overhauls of owned and finance leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes is capitalised and then amortised over between two and ten years until the next scheduled major overhaul, except where the maintenance of engines and auxiliary power units is carried out under fixed rate contracts, in which case the cost is spread over the period of the contract.
Provision is made for the future costs of major overhauls of leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes by making appropriate charges to the income statement, calculated by reference to hours flown and or the expired lease period, as a consequence of obligations placed upon the Group under the terms of certain of the operating leases.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Revenue recognition and associated costs Revenue represents the aggregate amount of gross revenue receivable from inclusive tours, travel agency commissions receivable and other services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business.
Revenue and direct expenses relating to inclusive tours arranged by the Groups leisure travel providers, including travel agency commission, insurance and other incentives, are taken to the income statement on holiday departure.
Revenue relating to travel agency commission on third-party leisure travel products is also recognised on holiday departure.
Other revenue and associated expenses are taken to the income statement as earned or incurred.
Revenue and expenses exclude intra-group transactions.
Income statement presentation Profit or loss from operations includes the results from operating activities of the Group, before its share of the results of associates and joint ventures.
Exceptional items are items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence and which the Groups management consider should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
Material business combination intangible assets were acquired as a result of the merger between Thomas Cook AG and MyTravel Group plc and the subsequent acquisitions made in the current year.
The amortisation of these intangible assets is significant and the Groups management consider that it should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
Tax Tax represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated tax is also recognised directly in equity.
Tax currently payable is provided on taxable profits based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for deferred tax so as to recognise all temporary differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date that result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future, except as set out below.
This is calculated on a non-discounted basis by reference to the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the relevant jurisdictions and for the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
The deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction does not affect either accounting or taxable profit or loss.
Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 75 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Deferred tax assets are assessed at each balance sheet date and are only recognised to the extent that their recovery against future taxable profits is probable.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for the temporary differences of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution of those earnings and it is probable that they will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
Pensions Pension costs charged against profits in respect of the Groups defined contribution schemes represent the amount of the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
The Group also operates a number of defined benefit schemes.
The pension liabilities recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these schemes represent the difference between the present value of the Groups obligations calculated using the projected unit credit method under the schemes and the fair value of those schemes assets.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the period in which they arise within the statement of recognised income and expense.
Other movements in the pension liability are recognised in the income statement.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Foreign currency Average exchange rates are used to translate the results of all subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that have a functional currency other than sterling.
The balance sheets of such entities are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange differences are recorded through a separate component of equity.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of an entity are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities held at the period end are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange gain or loss is recorded in the income statement.
When a foreign entity is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Leases Leases under which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group are finance leases.
All other leases are operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of minimum lease payments within property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their expected useful lives.
The interest element of finance lease payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are recognised at their fair value.
When a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting as a cash flow hedge, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting as a cash flow hedge, changes in fair value that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and is included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised in the income statement when the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability, attributable to the hedged risk, occur.
Non-derivative financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group transfers the financial asset or when the contractual rights expire.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The measurement of particular financial assets and liabilities is set out below.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method as reduced by allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
An allowance for irrecoverable amounts is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value.
Gains or losses except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised directly in equity until the financial asset is derecognised.
At this point, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Any impairment losses, foreign exchange gains or losses or dividends receivable are recognised in the income statement.
Held-for-trading investments Short-term investments are classified as held-for-trading and are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value.
Gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are recognised at their fair value net of any directly attributable transaction costs.
They are subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
com FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, if it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are recognised and subsequently recorded at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted to its present value.
Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees, according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity settled share options to certain employees as part of their total remuneration.
The fair values of the share options are calculated at the date of grant, using an appropriate option pricing model.
These fair values are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the expected vesting period of the options, with a corresponding increase in equity reserves.
Insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts Premiums written relate to business incepted during the year, together with any differences between the booked premiums for prior years and those previously accrued, less cancellations.
Premiums are recognised as revenue earned premiums proportionally over the period of coverage.
Premiums are shown after the deduction of commission and premium taxes where relevant.
Claims and loss adjustment expenses are charged to income as incurred based on the estimated liability for compensation owed to policyholders or third parties damaged by policyholders.
The Group does not discount its liabilities for unpaid claims.
Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated using the input of assessments for individual cases reported to the Group and statistical analysis for the claims incurred but not reported.
Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for losses on one or more contracts issued by the Group and that meet the classification requirements for insurance contracts are classified as reinsurance contracts held.
The benefits to which the Group is entitled under its reinsurance contracts held are recognised as receivables from reinsurers.
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on an annual basis.
Receivables and payables are recognised when due.
These include amounts due to and from insurance policyholders.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, described above, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Residual values of tangible fixed assets Judgements have been made in respect of the residual values of aircraft included in property, plant and equipment.
Those judgements determine the amount of depreciation charged in the income statement.
Recoverable amounts of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life Judgements have been made in respect of the amounts of future operating cash flows to be generated by certain of the Groups businesses in order to assess whether there has been any impairment of the amounts included in the balance sheet for goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life in relation to those businesses.
Special purpose entities The nature of the relationship with certain special purpose entities involved in leasing aircraft to the Group shows that they should be interpreted as controlled by the Group, and therefore consolidated, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life Determining whether goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life at the balance sheet date were 2,951.8m and 210.9m respectively 2007: 2,481.4m: 196.9m.
No impairment losses were recorded during the year.
Recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments Estimates have been made in respect of the volumes of future trading with hoteliers and the credit-worthiness of those hoteliers in order to assess the recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments made to those hoteliers.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Provisions for the cost of maintaining leased aircraft and spares are based on forecast aircraft utilisation, estimates of future maintenance costs and planned rollover and renewal of the aircraft fleet.
Tax The Group operates in many tax regimes and the tax implications of its operations are complex.
It can take several years for tax liabilities to be agreed with the relevant authorities.
Tax assets and liabilities represent managements estimate of tax that will be payable or recoverable in the future and may be dependent on estimates of future profitability.
In addition, estimates have been made in respect of the probable future utilisation of tax losses and deferred tax assets have been recognised.
The recoverability of these assets is dependent on the agreement of the losses with the relevant authorities and the estimates of future profitability.

Segmental information For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into five geographic operating divisions: UK and Ireland, Continental Europe, Northern Europe, North America and Airlines Germany.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Certain residual businesses and corporate functions are not allocated to these divisions and are shown separately as Corporate.
The primary business of all of these operating divisions is the provision of leisure travel services and, accordingly, no separate secondary segmental information is provided.

At 30 September 2008, the review was undertaken on a value in use basis, assessing whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from those assets, using cash flow projections discounted at a pre-tax rate of 10% to 13% 2007: 10% to 11% reflecting specific risks relating to the relevant segments.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, revenue and cost growth rates and the level of capital expenditure required during the period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recently approved annual budgets and three year plans of the relevant businesses.
The cash flow forecasts reflect the risk associated with each asset.
Cash flow forecasts for years beyond the three year plan period are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates which do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
There were no impairment losses for the period 2007: nil and no reasonable change to the assumptions would lead to an impairment.

No interest is charged on the receivables.
The credit risk in respect of direct receivables from customers is limited as payment is required in full before the services are provided.
In the case of travel services sold by thirdparty agents, the credit risk depends on the credit-worthiness of those third parties, but this risk is also limited because of the relatively short period of credit.
Deposits and prepayments include amounts paid in advance to suppliers of hotel and other services in order to guarantee the provision of those supplies and historically have covered periods from 1 to 24 months in advance.
The Groups current policy is that deposits and prepayments will normally only be made for periods of up to twelve months in advance.
There is a credit risk in respect of the continued operation of those suppliers during those periods.
Deposits and prepayments also include 63.3m 2007: 54.7m of deposits on aircraft lease arrangements which are primarily attributable to the UK Airline.

Loans include advances of 2.1m 2007: 1.8m to two hotel companies in which the Group has a participating interest.
These loans are interest bearing at rates based on Euribor and are unsecured.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Allowances for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivable balances are managed in the business units where the debts arise and are based on local management experience.
Factors that are considered include the age of the debt, previous experience with the counterparty and local trading conditions.
Trade receivables arise from individual customers as well as businesses in the travel sector.
The Directors do not consider there to be significant concentration of credit risk relating to trade and other receivables.

Financial instruments continued The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge against significant future transactions and cash flows.
The Group enters into a variety of foreign currency forward contracts and options in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments used are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets and the currency exposures in those markets, predominantly euro, US dollar and sterling, and are typically established for periods of 12 to 24 months in advance of a season to which the expected cash exposures pertain.
The Group undertakes hedging transactions to limit the risk of unfavourable changes in the jet fuel prices and to reduce the weighted average cost of fuel.
The Groups hedging policy aims to hedge up to 95 % of the Groups fuel requirements.
As at 30 September 2008, the Group had put in place hedging transactions for fuel volumes of 1,880,870 metric tonnes 2007:1,675,555 metric tonnes with terms running up until September 2010 at the latest three future seasons.
The Group uses combination of fixed price forward or swap contracts in either crude oil, gas oil and kerosene and net purchased collars in crude oil to hedge against its fuel price risk.
The Group is also subject to risks arising from interest rate movements in connection with the financing of aircraft and other assets.
Interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate and the US dollar euro sterling currency risk on such borrowings.
Interest rate currency swaps are reported within interest rate derivatives.
The maturities of interest rate derivatives extend out to May 2011 at the latest.
The fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments set out before have been determined by reference to prices available from the markets in which the instruments are traded.

The amount included in each line item in the income statement is shown below.
In addition, a loss of 25.7m was recognised in the income statement in respect of the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges 2007: 3.7m loss.
Financial risk The Group is subject to risks related to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, fuel prices, counterparty credit and liquidity within the framework of its business operations.
Details of the nature of these risks and the policies and processes that the Group operates to manage them and mitigate any financial impact are set out in the Financial review on pages 44 and 45.
The market risks that the Group is subject to have been identified as interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and fuel price risk.
The impact of reasonably possible changes in these risk variables on the Group, based on the period end holdings of financial instruments have been calculated and are set out in the tables below.
In each case it has been assumed that all other variables remain constant.
As explained in note 24, fuel price risk is hedged through the use of a combination of derivative instruments.
For the purpose of illustrating sensitivity, the price of the underlying commodity in each instrument has been assumed to change by 20%.

The Groups approach to credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables is explained in note 19.
Insurance Management of insurance risk Incidental to its main business, the Group, through its subsidiary White Horse Insurance Ireland Limited, issues contracts that transfer significant insurance risk and that are classified as insurance contracts.
As a general guideline, the Group defines as significant insurance risk the possibility of having to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder.
Business written includes standard commercial risks for the Group and travel insurance for both Group and non-Group customers.
The principal nature of travel insurance risks is one of short-term, low value and high volume.
Underwriting performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and pricing reviewed annually for each individual contract.
Exposure is capped by specific limits within the insurance policy and by using reinsurance contracts for any claims in excess of these retention limits.
Commercial policies with the Group are subject to policy excesses and single event and aggregate limits.
Insurance risk is spread across several European countries where the Group operates including the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia.
When estimating the cost of claims outstanding at the period end, the principal assumption underlying the estimates is the Groups past development pattern.
This includes assumptions in respect of historic claims costs, average claims handling expenses and market developments.
The Group also uses an independent actuary to review its liabilities to ensure that the carrying values are adequate.
Any changes to these variables are not expected to have a material effect on the Group financial statements.
The Group operates a reinsurance policy approved by the Board which ensures that reinsurers have a financial stability rating of B A M Best or above.
The Group has assessed these credit ratings as being satisfactory in diminishing the Groups exposure to the credit risk of its insurance receivables.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: 2008 2007 m m Deferred tax assets 328.6 294.5 Deferred tax liabilities 97.8 83.8 230.8 210.7 At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of 1,327.9m 2007: 1,255.0m available for offset against future profits.
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised where there is sufficient probability that there will be future taxable profits against which the assets may be recovered.
The increase in recognised tax losses in the period relates to non-recurring exceptional costs.
The UK and German business generated taxable profits before exceptional items which support the recognition of losses in these territories.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses of 531.0m 2007: 558.0m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Other temporary differences, on which deferred tax has been provided, primarily relate to the difference in book to tax value on qualifying tax assets, provisions for which tax relief was not originally available and fair value accounting on properties acquired as part of the merger.
In addition, the Group had unused other short-term timing differences in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised amounting to 34.0m 2007: 47.0m, also due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Deferred tax liabilities were offset against the corresponding deferred tax assets where both items fell within the responsibility of the same tax authority.
com FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the period end, without taking into consideration the offsetting balances within the same jurisdiction are 476.5m and 245.5m respectively.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognised was 295.2m 2007: 269.0m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Other provisions relate to provisions for onerous contracts and future obligations, including those arising as a result of reorganisation and restructuring plans that are irrevocably committed and include severance payments and provisions for social security compensation plans.
Provisions included in non-current liabilities are principally in respect of onerous contracts and are expected to be utilised over the term of those contracts which extend up to ten years from the balance sheet date.

Share-based payments The Company operates four equity-settled share-based payment schemes, as outlined below.
The total expense recognised during the period in respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions was 3.1m 2007: 0.6m.
The Thomas Cook Group plc 2007 Performance Share Plan PSP Executive Directors and senior executives of the Company and its subsidiaries are granted options to acquire, or contingent share awards of, the ordinary shares of the Company.
The awards will vest if performance targets for Earnings Per Share EPS and Total Shareholder Return TSR are met during the three years following the date of grant.
Subject to vesting conditions, the options are exercisable up to ten years after the date of grant.
The Thomas Cook Group plc 2008 Co-Investment Plan COIP Executive Directors and senior executives may be required to purchase the Companys shares using a proportion of their net bonus Lodged Shares.

The Thomas Cook Group plc 2008 Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE In May 2008, all eligible employees were offered options to purchase shares in the Company by entering into a three year savings contract.
The option exercise price was set at a 20% discount to the market price at the offer date.
Options are exercisable between three years and three years and six months after the start of the savings contract.
The Thomas Cook Group plc 2008 HM Revenue & Customs Approved Buy As You Earn Scheme BAYE In May 2008, all eligible UK tax paying employees were offered the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company by deduction from their gross pay.
For every ten shares an employee buys in this way, the Company will purchase one Matching Share on their behalf.
At 30 September 2008, 4,506 Matching Shares had been purchased.
The movements in options and awards during the period were: 2008 2007 PSP COIP SAYE PSP Outstanding at beginning of period 2,869,648 Granted 4,304,331 985,046 3,349,444 2,869,648 Exercised 83,333 Forfeited 516,460 22,294 Outstanding at end of period 6,574,186 985,046 3,327,150 2,869,648 Exercisable at end of period Exercise price nil nil 2.15 nil Average remaining contractual life years 9.2 9.8 3.3 9.7 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised during the period was 2.40.

Retirement benefit schemes Pension schemes for the employees of the Thomas Cook Group consist of defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, with the defined benefit plans being both funded and unfunded.
The obligations arising from defined contribution plans are satisfied by contribution payments to both private and state-run insurance providers.
Unfunded defined benefit pension obligations Unfunded defined benefit pension obligations primarily relate to the Groups employees in the German businesses of Thomas Cook AG and the Condor Group.
Provisions are established on the basis of commitments made to those employees for old-age and transitional pensions based on the legal, tax and economic circumstances of the individual countries and on the period of employment and level of remuneration of the respective employees.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations totalling 138.9m 2007: 140.9m were attributable to the pension commitments of Condor Group Condor Flugdienst GmbH and Condor Berlin GmbH.
For employees who joined a Condor Group company prior to 1995, the total pension commitment of the pensions authority of the German federal government and regional states was adjusted and maintained in the form of a company pension scheme.
com FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The flight crews were additionally entitled to a transitional provision for the period between the termination of their in-flight employment and the time they became eligible for a state-run or company pension.
In both cases, the benefit commitment depended on the final salaries of the employees concerned prior to the termination of their in-flight employment final salary plan.
Employees who joined a Condor Group company after 1994 participate in a company pension scheme under which the pension entitlements are based on the average salaries of those employees average salary plan.
Condor Group also has retirement obligations arising from individual commitments and transitional provisions.
In accordance with IAS 19, all these commitments are classified as unfunded defined benefit obligations and classified as such in these financial statements.
The Condor Group defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants with the exception of pilots since 2004.
There are additional unfunded defined benefit obligations comprising individual commitments to executive staff at Thomas Cook Group and obligations in respect of past service for employees in Sweden.
The unfunded pension benefits are accounted for as part of liabilities for retirement benefit obligations in the balance sheet.
The following weighted average actuarial assumptions were made for the purpose of determining the unfunded defined benefit obligations: 2008 2007 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 6.16% 5.50% Expected rate of salary increases 2.98% 2.80% Future pension increases 2.34% 2.00% The mortality tables 2005 G drawn up by Prof. Dr Klaus Heubeck were used as the basis for the mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of the pension obligations at 30 September 2008.
These assume a life expectancy for members currently aged 60 of 22.35 years for men and 26.98 years for women.
Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Current service cost 7.3 10.2 Past service cost 0.3 Curtailment gain 1.3 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 8.5 7.9 Total included in income statement 14.2 18.1 Service costs have been included in personnel expenses in the income statement and the unwinding of the discount rate of the expected retirement benefit obligations has been included in finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Changes in the present value of unfunded pension obligations were as follows: 2008 2007 m m At beginning of period 162.3 185.8 Current service cost 7.3 10.2 Past service cost 0.3 Interest cost 8.5 7.9 Benefits paid 3.5 8.3 Settlements 7.8 3.3 Curtailments 1.3 Actuarial gains 23.6 42.4 Acquisitions 0.7 5.5 Exchange difference 21.5 6.9 At end of period 163.8 162.3 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 107 Notes to the financial statements continued 38.
Retirement benefit schemes continued Funded defined benefit pension obligations The pension entitlements of employees of Thomas Cook UK, the Groups Dutch companies and employees in Norway are provided through funded defined benefit schemes where pension contributions are paid over to the schemes and the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries in each country.
The fair value of the pension assets in each scheme at the period end is compared with the present value of the retirement benefit obligations and the net difference reported as a pension asset or retirement benefit obligation as appropriate.
Pension assets are only recognised to the extent that they will result in reimbursements being made or future payments being reduced.
Funded defined benefit pension obligations have been determined on the basis of assumptions relevant to each country and the weighted averages of these were: 2008 2007 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 6.40 5.70 Inflation rate 3.40 3.25 Expected return on scheme assets 6.98 7.10 Expected rate of salary increases 4.33 4.50 Future pension increases 3.40 3.25 The Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan accounts for approximately 90% of the total funded defined benefit obligations and the mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of those obligations at 30 September 2008 are based on a life expectancy for members currently aged 60 of 25.2 years for men and 28.3 years for women.
The Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan has been closed to new entrants since April 2003.
Employees who have joined since that date participate in a new defined contribution scheme.
Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Current service cost 14.3 17.9 Past service cost 0.2 Gain on settlements 0.2 Expected return on scheme assets 41.9 38.9 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 33.4 30.0 Total included in income statement 5.8 9.0 Service costs have been included in personnel expenses in the income statement and the unwinding of the discount rate of the expected retirement benefit obligations has been included in finance costs.
