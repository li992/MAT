80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 94 Notes to the Company Accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for derivatives financial instruments which have been measured at fair value and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently through current and prior year.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption from presenting a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 Revised Cash Flow Statements.
The company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the group.
Further, the company, as a parent company of a group drawing up consolidated financial statements that meet the requirements of IFRS 7, is exempt from disclosures that comply with its UK GAAP equivalent, FRS 29 Financial Statements: Disclosures.
Accounting policies Turnover Turnover represents income from advertising, subscriptions, sponsorship and delegate fees, net of value added tax.
Advertising revenues are recognised in the income statement on the date of publication.
Subscription revenues are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the subscription.
Sponsorship and delegate revenues are recognised in the income statement over the period the event is run.
Turnover invoiced but relating to future periods are deferred and treated as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line or other systematic basis as allowed by SSAP 21 Accounting for Leases and Hire Purchase Contracts.
Pension schemes Details of the companys pension schemes are set out in note 27 to the group accounts.
The company participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme.
It is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in this scheme.
The defined benefit scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with no segregation of the assets to individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all participating employers i. e. the contribution rate charged to each employer is affected by the experience of the scheme as a whole.
The scheme is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the company.
This means that the pension charge included in these financial statements is the same as the cash contributions due in the period.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is provided on the straight-line basis over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Freehold land and buildings 2% Short-term leasehold premises over term of lease Office equipment 11% - 33% Goodwill Where the company has divisionalised the unincorporated businesses of its subsidiaries, the investment in the subsidiary then has the substance of goodwill and is reclassified accordingly.
Goodwill arising in these circumstances is not amortised in the company where the directors are of the view that the goodwill has an indefinite economic life, but is reviewed annually for impairment.
The non-amortisation of goodwill represents a departure from the Companies Act 1985 but is necessary to give a true and fair view under the provisions of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
It is not possible to quantify the impact of this departure, as it would depend on the life adopted.
94 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 95 1 Accounting policies continued Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is calculated under the provisions of FRS 19 Deferred Taxation, and is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when the timing differences crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange of the related foreign exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The company uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks, including forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps.
All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value.
Recognition of gains or losses on derivative instruments depends on whether the instrument is designated as a hedge and the type of exposure it is designed to hedge.
The effective portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedges are deferred in equity until the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The ineffective portion of such gains and losses is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
Gains or losses on the qualifying part of net investment hedges are recognised in equity together with the gains and losses on the underlying net investment.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise.
The premium or discount on interest rate instruments is recognised as part of net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Liabilities for put options over the remaining minority interests in subsidiaries are recorded in the balance sheet at their estimated discounted present value.
These discounts are unwound and charged to the income statement as notional interest over the period up to the date of the potential future payment.
In respect of options over further interests in joint ventures and associates, only movements in their fair value are recognised.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount, less provision for impairment.
A provision is made and charged to the profit and loss account when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand includes cash, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are approved by the companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If it is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 95 80766 notes 8 12 08 19:07 Page 96 Notes to the Company Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Share-based payments The company makes share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
At the period end the vesting assumptions are revisited and the charge associated with the fair value of these options updated.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20 Share-based payments has been applied to all grants of options after November 7 2002, that were unvested at October 1 2004, the date of application of FRS 20.

The ultimate parent company, Daily Mail and General Trust plc, is required to account for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The IAS 19 disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts of Daily Mail and General Trust plc have been based on calculations performed as part of the work being carried out for the formal valuation of the scheme as at March 31 2007, and adjusted to September 30 2008 by the actuary.
The calculations are adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by IAS 19.
These showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 1,322.5 million 2007: 650.0 million and that the actuarial value of these assets represented 99% 2007: 106% of the benefits that had accrued to members also calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations and disclosures required under IAS 19 for the financial statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc are not materially different to the valuations and disclosures required under FRS 17.
The group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme.
The scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with no segregation of the assets to individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all participating employers i. e. the contribution rate charged to each employer is affected by the experience of the schemes as a whole.
This means that the pension charge reported in these financial statements is the same as the cash contributions due in the period.

The directors are of the opinion that based on recent and forecast trading, the level of profits in future years are more likely than not to be sufficient to enable the asset to be recovered.

13 Share based payments An explanation of the companys share based payment arrangements are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 32.
The number of shares under option, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used to determine their values is given in note 23 to the group accounts.
Their dilutive effect on the number of weighted average shares of the company is given in note 10 to the group accounts.
Equity settled options The executive and Save as You Earn Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the groups share price over a 13 year period.
The executive options fair values have been discounted at a rate of 10% to reflect their performance conditions.
The expected term of the option used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The expense recognised in the year in respect of these options was 281,000 2007: 202,000.

It is anticipated that the revenue transactions will take place during the next 48 months at which stage the amount deferred in equity will be released in the income statement.
The ineffective portion recognised directly in the companys profit or loss that arose from cash flow hedges in the year was a loss of 11,961,000 2007: gain 7,331,000.
As at September 30 2008 all net investment hedges were classified as effective.
The company holds all the interest rate swaps for the group and full details regarding these can be found in note 18 to the group accounts.
There were no derivatives outstanding at the balance sheet date that were designated as fair value hedges.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The company has US dollar denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment of its subsidiaries which have US Dollars as their functional currency.
The change in fair value of these hedges resulted in an increased liability of 12,936,000 2007: nil.
The ineffective portion of these hedges was 2,563,000 2007: nil and has been charged to profit and loss account, the remaining portion has been deferred in reserves and will only be recognised in the companys profit and loss account if the related investment is sold.
Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amounts of shortterm borrowings approximate the book value.
