Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 13.
Intangible assets continued Goodwill As from 3 July 2004, goodwill is no longer amortised and is annually tested for impairment.
The goodwill charge of 2.4m 2007 2.4m is in respect of rail businesses which, due to the finite nature of the franchises, require the goodwill to be impaired annually.
Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to individual cash-generating units for impairment testing on the basis of the Groups business operations.
The carrying value of goodwill by cash-generating unit is as follows: Restated 2008 2007 m m Aviance and Plane Handling 16.1 16.1 Meteor Parking 18.4 18.4 New Southern Railway 3.4 5.8 Metrobus 6.5 6.5 Go South Coast 28.6 28.6 Brighton & Hove 2.1 2.1 Go West Midlands 3.8 London Bus 10.5 10.9 Go North East 0.8 86.4 92.2 The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation for each cash-generating unit, using cashflow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three-year period.
Growth has been extrapolated forward from the end of the forecasts, using the following growth rates which reflect the Directors view of long-term growth rates in each business: 2008 2007 % % Aviance and Plane Handling 2.25 2.25 Meteor Parking New Southern Railway 3.00 3.00 London Bus 3.00 Other bus businesses 3.00 3.00 The cashflows for all cash-generating units have been discounted using a discount rate of 12.1% 2007 10.6%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, plus an appropriate risk premium for each cash-generating unit of 0-2% 2007 0-2%.
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the forecast operating cashflows, the discount rate and the growth rate used to extrapolate cashflows beyond the budget period.
The operating cashflows are based on assumptions of revenue, staff costs and general overheads.
These assumptions are influenced by several factors both internally and externally.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each unit and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
It is believed that any reasonably possible movement on assumptions will not lead to an impairment and we have therefore not presented any sensitivity analysis.

On 8 December 2007 Metrobus Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired FirstGroups regulated bus operations in Orpington.
The total cash consideration for the above acquisitions was 5.5m.
They have been accounted for as acquisitions in accordance with IFRS3.
The acquisition balance sheets have been adjusted to reflect provisional fair values and the goodwill arising has been capitalised as an intangible asset.
Intangible assets acquired represent customer contracts of 1.2m.
Management believes that the goodwill represents future growth opportunities and created value to the Group in respect of noncontractual relationships, customer loyalty, and an assembled workforce, for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted.
A property valuation has been completed.
