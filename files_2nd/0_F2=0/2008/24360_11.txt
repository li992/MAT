The risk capital consumed by the Investment Manager should approximate the risk budget articulated in the risk and return objectives for the Company.

As the Company is primarilya price taker from the Investees, there is no guarantee that the ongoing Due Diligence Process and oversight in place will be adequate to ensure that errors or fraud will not take place at an Investee level.

Tracking Error Predicted tracking error isone possiblemeasure of the forward lookingorforecasted dispersion ofa portfoliosexcess returns .
Morespecifically, itisthe forward looking forecast of the standard deviation of such excess returns.
Normal statistical distributions of returns suggests that approximately twothirds of the time the Companys returns will lie in a range equal tothe benchmark return plus or minus the predicted tracking error estimate if the market behaves in a manner suggested by the historical relationships used toproduce the predictions.
Predicted tracking error is derived from current holdings and .

Such limitations include, but are not limited to, the assumption that historical marketriskfactors are good predictors of future marketrisk, and that historicalvolatility of returns will be repeated in the future.
In addition, changes in the investment positions could create material differences between predicted and realised levels of Tracking Error.
Predicted Tracking Error is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets without sudden fundamental changes or sudden shifts in market conditions.
Also, past tracking error is not indicative of future tracking errors and there can be noassurance that future levels of  Companywillbe at levelsreflected bythe , orwill .
Moreover,  volatility are predictive of levels that will be produced in the future.

VaR is presented below as a sensitivity .
 are reasonable given that VaR is only one determinant in the Investment Managers overall risk management.
In general the Companyobtains VaR from Predicted Tracking Error TE byscalingthe annualised TE forecast intoa daily forecast by dividing by the square root of 252, representing the number of business days in a year and then multiplyingthat result by1.645 togive a 95% confidence level.

ii Interest rate risk The Investees may invest in fixed income securitiesand interestrate swap contracts.
Anychange torelevant interest rates for particular securities may result in the advisors being unable to secure similar returns on the expiry of contractsor thesaleofsecurities.
Inaddition,  rates may result in an increase or decrease in the value of the securities held.
In general, if interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities will decline.
A decline in interest rates will in general have the opposite effect.

These side pocket share classes may have restricted liquidity and prohibit the Company from fully liquidating its investments without delay.

These estimates are based on information received from the majority, but not all of, the Advisors, and the Company has no way of independently  .
