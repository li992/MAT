The remaining Group investments are included in other investments.
b Presenting an unclassified balance sheet results in removal of the categorisation of assets and liabilities as current and non-current.
Assets and liabilities are now presented in order of liquidity, and the opportunity has been taken to summarise and remove smaller balances from the face of the balance sheet, as follows: i Trade and other receivables includes balances previously presented as current and non-current receivables: ii Trade and other payables includes balances previously presented as current and non-current payables: iii Borrowings includes balances previously presented as long-term and short-term borrowings and overdrafts: and iv Deferred tax liabilities are netted against deferred tax assets, as the gross balances are not significant.
c Joint ventures are insignificant and have been summarised into the associates note.
Both items are subject to equity accounting.
d Items of share capital and reserves attributable to the shareholders that previously were separately disclosed, have been summarised into one line on the face of the balance sheet.
Further details of these balances are provided in the Statement of Changes in Recognised Income and Expense and in Notes 19-22.
