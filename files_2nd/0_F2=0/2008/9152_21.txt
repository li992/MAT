This has IAS 1 Presentation of Financial no impact on the classi cation and valuation of the Groups financial instruments, nor to the disclosures Statements: Capital Disclosures relating to taxation and trade and other payables.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments, where the identi able consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued in order to establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
This had no impact on the Groups results.
IFRIC 9 Re-assessment of embedded Requires that a re-assessment of whether embedded derivatives should be separated from the underlying derivatives host contract should be made only where there are changes to the contract.

It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or funding requirements and contractual minimum funding requirement.

The following standards, amendments and interpretations became effective but were not relevant to the Groups results: IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Addresses the application of IAS 29 when an economy first becomes hyperin ationary and in particular Approach under IAS 29 the accounting for deferred tax.
Financial Reporting in Hyperin ationary Economies At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were issued but not yet effective: IAS 23 Borrowing costs effective from Still subject to endorsement by the European Union.
Requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs Amendment 1 January 2009 directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of that asset.
The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed.
This will be applied in the Groups 2009 10 financial statements.
IFRS 8 Operating segments effective IFRS 8 will replace IAS 14 and will align segment reporting with the requirements of the US standard from 1 January 2009 SFAS 131 Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.
The new standard requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
IFRIC 12 Service concession Applies to contractual arrangements whereby a private sector operator participates in the development, arrangements effective from nancing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure for public sector services.
This is not expected 1 January 2008 to be relevant to the Group as none of the Groups companies provide public sector services.

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions which have a signi cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other assets The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash ows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Actual outcomes could vary signi cantly from these estimates.
See note 12 for further information.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Signi cant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes in each territory.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts which were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
See notes 9 and 26 for further information.
Post employment bene ts The present value of the fide ned bene t liabilities recognised on the balance sheet is dependent on interest rates of high quality corporate bonds.
The net nancing charge or return is dependent on both the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds and the assumed investment returns on scheme assets.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations, including mortality rates, are based in part on current market conditions.
See note 27 for further information.
Restructuring provision The Group provided 224m in 2005 06 relating to the closure and downsizing of stores in B&Q UK and the termination of the B&Q UK financial services arrangement.
The ultimate costs and timing of cash ows are dependent on exiting the property lease contracts on the closed stores and sub-dividing and sub-letting the surplus space released from those stores to be downsized, as detailed in note 28.

A tax credit of 2m has been recognised in the income statement relating to exceptional items, of which 14m is charged against the current year tax charge in relation to the 4m net exceptional income, with the remaining 16m credit in respect of prior periods, relating to tax previously provided on exceptional items.
The tax credit on exceptional items for the year ended 3 February 2007 was 8m, of which 3m related to adjustments in respect of prior years.
In addition to the amounts charged to the income statement, tax of 19m 2006 07: 30m was charged directly to equity.
Of the 19m, 13m is included in deferred tax and 6m is included in current tax.
King sher paid 137.5m tax to the French tax authorities in the year ended 31 January 2004 as a consequence of the Kesa Electricals demerger and recorded this as an exceptional tax charge.
Proceedings for the recovery of this tax have been initiated and although this may take several years to be resolved, King sher believes that the risk of ultimately being liable for this amount is low.
No asset has been recognised in these financial statements as the recovery of this amount is not suf ciently certain at this time.
In certain circumstances, it is possible that the conditions of the UK and French tax clearances for the demerger of Kesa Electricals in the year ended 31 January 2004 could be breached.
Whilst the consequences of such a breach could be signi cant, the Group actively monitors compliance with these conditions and believes that the likelihood of any breach is remote.

Fair value is taken to be the open market value at the date of valuation.
All property acquired from 1 February 2004 is carried at cost.
Included in land and buildings is leasehold land in the UK, China, Poland, Russia and Germany.
This leasehold land is in effect a prepayment for the use of land and is accordingly being amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
The cost and depreciation of leasehold land included in land and buildings at 2 February 2008 were 273m and 50m 2006 07: 254m and 45m respectively.
The Group does not revalue properties within its financial statements.
A valuation exercise is performed for internal purposes annually in October by independent external valuers covering over one third of the property portfolio with the remaining portfolio valued internally.
Based on this the value of property would be 3.5 billion 2006 07: 3.1bn.

The average lease term maturity for buildings is eight years 2006 07: nine years and for xtures and equipment is two years 2006 07: two years.
Building leases include a clause to enable upward revision of the rental charge to prevailing market conditions.

Fair value of borrowings The fair values of current borrowings approximate to their carrying amounts.
Where available, market values have been used to determine the fair value of non-current borrowings.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

Fair value hedges Interest rate swap contracts convert xed rate debt issued under the Groups MTN programme and the US Private Placement to oating rate liabilities.
At 2 February 2008 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was 1,202m 2006 07: 1,151m.
In ation swaps hedge in ation rate exposures in certain property lease contracts.
The swaps limit the annual in ation uplift on the underlying lease payments at 3% each year until April 2021 and are accounted for as a fair value hedge of unrecognised future commitments.
At 2 February 2008 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was 10m 2006 07: 10m.
Cash ow hedges Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge currency exposures of forecast inventory purchases.
At 2 February 2008 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was 172m 2006 07: 158m.
The associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to inventories when the purchases occur during the next 12 months.
Losses of 8m 2006 07: 3m have been transferred to inventories for contracts which matured during the year.
Net investment hedges Forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps hedge currency exposures of overseas investments.
At 2 February 2008 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was 343m 2006 07: 295m.
Non-designated hedges The Group has entered into certain derivatives to provide a hedge of uctuations in the income statement arising from balance sheet positions.
At 2 February 2008 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was 609m 2006 07: 424m.
These have not been hedge accounted, since the fair value movements of the derivatives in the income statement offset the retranslation of the balance sheet position.
These include forward foreign exchange instruments hedging part of the funding of the Groups overseas operations, a cross-currency swap converting a euro-denominated debt into a Sterling liability and short-term foreign exchange and interest rate contracts.
The Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives.
The Group does not have any embedded derivatives which are not closely related to the host contract and therefore is not required to account for these separately.

The Board reviews the levels of exposure regularly and approves treasury policies covering the use of financial instruments required to manage these risks.
King sher Treasury is not run as a pro t centre and it does not enter into any transactions for speculative purposes.
In the normal course of business the Group uses financial instruments including derivative financial instruments.
The main types of financial instruments used are Medium Term Notes and other xed term debt, bank loans and deposits, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, spot and forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange options.
Interest rate risk Borrowings arranged at oating rates of interest expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk, whereas those arranged at xed rates of interest expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group manages its interest rate risk by entering into certain interest rate derivative contracts which modify the interest rate payable on the Groups underlying debt instruments, principally the Medium Term Notes and other xed term debt.
King shers policy is to manage the currency and interest rate pro le of its issued debt using derivative contracts.
The effect of these contracts on the Groups net debt was as follows: Sterling euro US Dollar Other millions Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Total At 2 February 2008 Net debt before derivatives 443 95 820 28 262 21 83 72 1,582 Derivatives 401 626 547 561 262 23 Net debt 42 721 273 533 21 83 72 1,559 At 3 February 2007 Net debt before derivatives 423 107 708 6 243 2 58 37 1,250 Derivatives 394 618 473 536 243 44 Net debt 29 511 235 542 2 58 37 1,294 Currency risk The Groups principal currency exposures are to the euro, the US Dollar, the Polish Zloty and the Chinese Renminbi.
The euro and Zloty exposures are operational and arise through the ownership of the retail businesses in France, Italy, Spain and Poland.
Balance sheet euro translation exposure is substantially hedged by maintaining a proportion of the Groups debt in euro.
In China, balance sheet translation exposure is partly hedged by local debt in China and partly by forward foreign exchange contracts entered into to hedge this exposure.
However, it is the Groups policy not to hedge the translation of overseas earnings primarily euro into Sterling.
In addition, the Group has signi cant transaction exposure arising on the purchase of inventories denominated in US Dollars, which it hedges using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Under Group policies, the Group companies are required to hedge committed inventory purchases and a proportion of forecast inventory purchases arising in the next 12 months, and this is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Financial instruments affected by interest rate and currency risks, being the principal market risks impacting King sher, include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.

It has been prepared on the basis that the Groups debt, hedging activities, hedging designation, foreign currency proportion of debt and derivative contracts remain constant, re ecting the positions at 2 February 2008 and 3 February 2007 respectively.
As a consequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions have been made in preparing the sensitivity analysis: the oating leg of any swaps, oating rate debt and cash and cash equivalents are treated as not having had the interest rate set.
A full 12 month effect of a change in interest rates is shown: the Groups designated fair value hedges are assumed to be fully effective, with gains or losses on derivative financial instruments and underlying hedged items offsetting fully in the income statement: forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash ow hedges of future US Dollar inventory purchases are assumed to be fully effective.
Changes in their carrying value due to sensitivity to US Dollar Sterling and US Dollar euro exchange rates are re ected in equity: the Groups designated net investment hedges are assumed to be fully effective, and as such do not expose the Group to currency risk and are not included in this analysis.
The above assumptions are made when illustrating the effect on the Groups income statement and equity given reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates, before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement to be 0.50%, based on recent interest rate history for Sterling and the euro.
Similarly, sensitivity to movements in US Dollar Sterling and US Dollar euro exchange rates of 10% are shown, re ecting changes of reasonable proportion in the context of movements in those currency pairs over recent years.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and long-term cash ow forecasts, supplemented by forecasts of financial headroom.
It promotes a diversity of funding sources and debt maturities, utilising committed bank revolving credit facilities to provide additional liquidity, which are available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital requirements.
The analysis below is of the contractual undiscounted cash ows payable under financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date.

Credit risk Credit risk of third parties that the Group deals with is managed by setting a credit limit using published credit ratings.
The exposure against this limit is determined by taking account of the full value of deposits and a proportion of the value of derivative contracts.
Credit risk is reduced by spreading the Groups debt, investment and derivatives transactions across a range of markets using counterparties with strong credit ratings.
The Group has a very low retail credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Groups financial assets at the balance sheet date is represented by the amounts reported under the corresponding balance sheet headings.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated and therefore no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
There are no other signi cant concentrations of credit risk associated with the financial instruments of the Group.
At 2 February 2008, trade and other receivables that were past due but not impaired amounted to 19m 2006 07: 10m, of which 3m 2006 07: 2m were over 120 days past due.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 21m 2006 07: 25m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 159m 2006 07: 131m due to the unpredictability of future pro t streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are tax losses arising in China and South Korea of 73m 2006 07: 55m which can only be carried forward in the next one to five years and tax losses arising in Spain of 24m 2006 07: 18m which can only be carried forward for up to 15 years.
Other losses may be carried forward inde nitely.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
Earnings which could be remitted on which there would be tax to pay total 191m 2006 07: 127m.

The most signi cant are the funded, final salary fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution schemes for the Groups UK employees: however various retirement bene t and fide ned contribution schemes are operated in France, Poland, Italy and China.
In France and Poland, they are retirement indemnity in nature: and in Italy, termination indemnity in nature.
a fide ned contribution schemes Pension costs for fide ned contribution schemes, at rates speci ed in the individual plans rules, are as follows: millions 2007 08 2006 07 fide ned contribution schemes 5 3 b fide ned bene t schemes The Groups principal fide ned bene t pension plan is in the UK.
The assets of this plan are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds.
The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans bene ciaries.
The Group also has other retirement bene t plans in other territories but these are not material in relation to the Group as a whole.
The Group has one main fide ned bene t pension plan in the UK the UK plan which was closed to new entrants in 2004.
A full actuarial valuation of the UK plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the plan Trustee and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2007.
The Company monitors the plan funding level on a regular basis and will review with the plan Trustee at future valuations the continued appropriateness of the repayment schedule currently in place.
c Principal actuarial valuation assumptions The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups fide ned bene t pension plans, as shown in the tables below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally quali ed actuaries.
The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time.
Movements in the financial assumptions can lead to signi cant movement in the estimated obligations of the plan, as illustrated in the sensitivity analysis in section d of this note.
The UK discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index.
The overall expected rate of return on plan assets re ects market expectations at the valuation date of long-term asset returns and the mix of assets in the plans.

For the UK plan, the base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables PA 92 tables projected forward to 2007 with the medium cohort improvement factors for males and with the standard improvement factors for females.
In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy.
For males, the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 1% pa, and for females, the allowance is in line with the standard improvements, subject to a minimum of 0.5% pa.
These improvements have been set with regard to trends observed within the plan over the past decade.
The corresponding assumptions for life expectancy of UK pension plan members are as follows: 2007 08 2006 07 Age to which current pensioners are expected to live 60 now Male 87.2 85.1 Female 85.9 86.3 Age to which future pensioners are expected to live 60 in 15 years time Male 88.8 86.2 Female 87.1 87.5 KF6712 p54-IBC v6a.

Since grants under the KIS are made following the year end to which the first year of charge relates, it is not possible to give the number of options granted until after the year end.
2 The weighted average exercise price for options granted during the period represents a blend of nil price KIS and Performance Share Plan options and discounted ShareSave options see below.
Options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the period.
On that basis, the weighted average share price during the year, rather than at the date of exercise, was 2.11 2006 07: 2.43.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have exercise prices ranging from nil to 2.45 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.2 years 2006 07: 3.6 years.
