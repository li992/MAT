Group financial statements 24526 Txt 49 108. qxp 12 6 08 11:19 am Page 53 Notes to the group financial statements 1 General information The Severn Trent group has a number of operations, these are described in the segmental analysis in note 5.
Severn Trent Plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom, the address of its registered office is shown on the back of the cover of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Severn Trent Plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
2 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, International Accounting Standards IAS and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective and ratified by the European Union as at 31 March 2008 and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The comparative figures for the balance sheet as at 31 March 2007 have been restated to reclassify the analysis of derivative financial instruments between current and non current amounts.
This balance sheet was originally prepared on the basis of widely prevailing practice at that time which was to classify as current assets or liabilities all derivative instruments that were not designated as hedges.
However, in May 2007 the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee reported that it had recommended to the IASB that IAS 1 be amended to remove the implication that such classification was required.
In view of this decision the group now classifies all derivative financial assets and liabilities according to their maturity.
The impact on the comparative balance sheet as at 31 March 2007 is to decrease current assets and increase non current assets by 12.5 million and to decrease current liabilities and increase non current liabilities by 57.5 million.
b Basis of consolidation The financial statements include the results of Severn Trent Plc and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings are included from the date of acquisition or incorporation, and excluded from the date of disposal.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated where the group has the power to control a subsidiary.
The results of joint venture undertakings are accounted for on an equity basis where the company exercised joint control under a contractual arrangement.
The results of associates are accounted for on an equity basis where the company holding is 20% or more or the company has the power to exercise significant influence.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the groups equity therein.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of changes in equity since that date.
Losses attributable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
All intra group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
c Revenue recognition Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding value added tax, trade discounts and intercompany sales, in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.
Revenue is not recognised until the service has been provided to the customer, or the goods to which the sale relates have either been despatched to the customer or, where they are held on the customers behalf, title has passed to the customer.
Turnover includes an estimate of the amount of mains water and waste water charges unbilled at the year end.
The accrual is estimated using a defined methodology based upon a measure of unbilled water consumed by tariff, which is calculated from historical billing information.
In respect of long term contracts, revenue is recognised based on the value of work carried out during the year with reference to the total sales value and the stage of completion of these contracts.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the groups rights to receive payment have been established.
Interest and dividend income are included in finance income.
Severn Trent 53 24526 Txt 49 108. qxp 12 6 08 11:19 am Page 54 Notes to the group financial statements continued d Exceptional items Exceptional items are income or expenditure, which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate should, in the opinion of the directors, be disclosed by virtue of their size or nature if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view.
In this context, materiality is assessed at the segment level.
e Taxation Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expenses that are taxable in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on taxable temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to utilise it.
Deferred taxation is measured on a non discounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have then been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
f Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets, whilst goodwill arising on acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates.
If an acquisition gives rise to negative goodwill this is credited directly to the income statement.
Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended within one year of the acquisition, if required, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.
Goodwill arising on all acquisitions prior to 1 April 1998 was written off to reserves under UK GAAP and remains eliminated against reserves.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions after 31 March 1998 is treated as an intangible fixed asset.
Goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy set out above and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating unit that derives benefit from the goodwill for impairment testing purposes.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and all or part of that unit is disposed of, the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount of that operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
g Intangible non current assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and when acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, the historical cost model is applied to intangible assets.
Amortisation charged on assets with finite lives is taken to the income statement through operating expenses.
Finite life intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Years Software 3-10 Other assets 2-20 Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment where indicators of impairment exist.
h Research and development Research expenditure is expensed when it is incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised and written off over its expected useful economic life where the following criteria are met: an asset is created that can be identified: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost can be measured reliably.
Expenditure on property, plant and equipment relating to research and development projects is capitalised and written off over the expected useful life of those assets.
i Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred except where it is probable that the contract will be awarded, in which case they are recognised as prepayments which are written off to the income statement over the life of the contract.
54 Severn Trent Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Group financial statements 24526 Txt 49 108. qxp 12 6 08 11:19 am Page 55 j Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprises: i Infrastructure assets Infrastructure assets are included at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS less accumulated depreciation.
The costs of like for like replacement of infrastructure components are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Where it is probable that the money spent will cause future economic benefits to flow to the group, then costs are capitalised.
Infrastructure assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives, which are as follows: Years Impounding reservoirs 250 Raw water aqueducts 250 Mains 80-150 Sewers 150-200 ii Other assets Other assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated over their estimated economic lives to their residual value, which are principally as follows: Years Buildings 30-80 Fixed plant and equipment 2-40 Vehicles and mobile plant 2-15 Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
Interest costs of debt raised to finance new property, plant and equipment are not included within the cost of those fixed assets, but are expensed to the income statement as they arise.
k Leased assets Where assets are financed by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee finance leases, the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments is capitalised as an asset with a corresponding liability representing the obligation to the lessor.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of a capital element and a finance charge, the capital element reducing the obligation to the lessor and the finance charge being written off to the income statement at a constant rate over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
Depreciation is charged over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease period.
Where assets are financed by leasing arrangements where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the lessor, these are classified as operating leases.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Leases of land are normally treated as operating leases, unless ownership is transferred at the end of the lease.
l Grants and contributions Grants and contributions received in respect of non current assets, including charges made for new connections to the water and sewerage networks, are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the useful economic life of those non current assets.
Grants and contributions which are given in compensation for expenses incurred with no future related costs are recognised in the income statement in the period that they become receivable.
m Impairment of non current assets If the recoverable amount of goodwill, an item of property, plant and equipment, or any other non current asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or estimated value in use at the date the impairment review is undertaken.
Fair value less costs to sell represents the amount obtainable from the sale of the assets in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing third parties, less costs of disposal.
Value in use represents the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from a cash generating unit, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the cost of capital of the cash generating unit or asset.
The discount rate used is based on the groups cost of capital adjusted for the risk profiles of individual businesses.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
Impairment reviews are also carried out if there is an indication that an impairment may have occurred, or, where otherwise required, to ensure that non current assets are not carried above their estimated recoverable amounts.
Impairments are recognised in the income statement.
Severn Trent 55 24526 Txt 49 108. qxp 12 6 08 11:19 am Page 56 Notes to the group financial statements continued n Investments After initial recognition at cost being the fair value of the consideration paid, investments which are classified as available for sale are measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognised in equity.
When an available for sale investment is disposed of, or impaired, the gain or loss previously recognised in equity is taken to the income statement.
Where there is no active market in the investments and the fair value cannot be measured reliably, the investments are held at cost.
Other investments are classified as held to maturity when the group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
Investments held for an undefined period are excluded from this classification.
Such investments and those held to maturity are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with any gains or losses being recognised in the income statement.
o Financial instruments i Debt instruments All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the net fair value of the consideration received.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Where a loan or borrowing is in a fair value hedging relationship it is remeasured for changes in fair value of the hedged risk at the balance sheet date, with gains or losses being recognised in the income statement see below.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
ii Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The group uses derivative financial instruments such as cross currency swaps, forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative instruments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently remeasured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.
Net interest receivable or payable in respect of derivative financial instruments is included in finance income or finance costs.
In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is taken to the income statement where the effective portion of the hedge will offset the gain or loss on the hedged item see above.
In relation to cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion in the income statement.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the income statement in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the income statement.
Where forward currency contracts and foreign currency borrowings are used to hedge net investments in foreign currency denominated operations, to the extent that they are designated and effective as net investment hedges, they are matched in equity against changes in value of the related assets.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that date any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, or transferred to the income statement if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, gains or losses are taken directly to the income statement in the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value, with gains and losses reported in the income statement.
p Inventory Inventory and work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials, transport and attributable overheads.
q Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at fair value on initial recognition and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method unless there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, where it is written down to its recoverable amount and the irrecoverable amount is recognised as an expense.
Trade receivables that are assessed not to be impaired individually are assessed collectively for impairment by reference to the groups historical collection experience for receivables of similar age.
r Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
56 Severn Trent Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Group financial statements 24526 Txt 49 108. qxp 12 6 08 11:19 am Page 57 s Retirement benefits The group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The difference between the value of defined benefit pension scheme assets and defined benefit pension scheme liabilities is recorded on the balance sheet as a retirement benefit asset or obligation.
Defined benefit pension scheme assets are measured using bid price.
Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date by an independent actuary using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
Service cost, which is the increase in the present value of the liabilities of the groups defined benefit pension schemes expected to arise from employee service in the period, is included in operating costs.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities, arising from the passage of time, are included in other finance income or cost.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to pension plans are charged or credited to equity and recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
t Provisions Provisions are recognised where: there is a present obligation as a result of a past event: it is probable that there will be an outflow of economic benefits to settle this obligation: and a reliable estimate of this amount can be made.
Insurance provisions are recognised for claims notified and for claims incurred but which have not yet been notified, based on advice from the groups independent insurance advisers.
u Purchase of own shares The group balance sheet includes the shares held by the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust and which have not vested unconditionally by the balance sheet date.
These are shown as a deduction from shareholders funds until such time as they vest.
v Share based payments The group operates a number of equity settled, share based compensation plans for employees.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the grant.
The fair value of employee services is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards granted calculated using an appropriate pricing model, excluding the impact of any non market vesting conditions.
The number of awards that are expected to vest takes into account non market vesting conditions including, where appropriate, continuing employment by the group.
The charge is adjusted to reflect shares that do not vest as a result of failing to meet a non market condition.
w Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Such investments are normally those with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition and include cash, balances at banks and investments in liquidity funds.
Cash and cash equivalents also include overdrafts repayable on demand.
x Foreign currency The results of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling, the presentational currency of the group, using average rates of exchange ruling during the year.
The net investments in overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Exchange differences thus arising are treated as movements in equity.
On disposal of a foreign currency denominated subsidiary, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity since 1 April 2004 relating to that entity is recognised in the income statement under the transitional rule of IFRS 1.
Exchange differences arising in respect of foreign exchange instruments taken out as hedges of overseas investments are also treated as movements in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective see note 2 t. All other foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of the company and its subsidiary undertakings are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the income statement.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
All profits and losses on exchange arising during the year are dealt with through the income statement.
Severn Trent 57 24526 Txt 49 108. qxp 12 6 08 11:19 am Page 58 Notes to the group financial statements continued y Discontinued operations and assets held for sale Where an asset or group of assets a disposal group is available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable and expected to occur within one year then the disposal group is deemed as held for sale.
The disposal group is measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Where a group of assets which comprises operations that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the group, a component, has been disposed of or classified as held for sale, and it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale then the component is classified as a discontinued operation.
Non current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Depreciation is not charged on such assets.
3 New accounting policies and future requirements In the current year the group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the groups financial instruments and management of capital see note 22.
Four Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the current period.
These are: IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach Under IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies: IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2: IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives: and IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment.
The adoption of these Interpretations has not led to any changes in the groups accounting policies.
The following statements have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and are likely to affect future financial statements.
International Financial Reporting Standard 8 Operating Segments IFRS 8 was issued in November 2006 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2009.
The standard requires identification of operating segments based on internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance.
The impact of the standard on Severn Trents financial statements is not expected to be significant since the groups segmental reporting already closely reflects reports regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive and the board.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements was issued in November 2006 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2008.
The interpretation draws a distinction between two types of services concession arrangement: those where the operator receives a financial asset, specifically an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from a government body in return for constructing or upgrading a public sector asset: and those where the operator receives an intangible asset, the right to charge for the use of the public sector asset that it constructs or upgrades.
The interpretation will be applicable to the groups contracts with the UK Ministry of Defence MoD and is expected to result in the recognition of both a financial asset in respect of the right to receive cash in return for upgrading the MoD assets and an intangible asset arising from the right to provide water and sewerage services.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes was issued in June 2007 and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008.
The interpretation addresses accounting by entities that grant loyalty award credits to customers.
It is not anticipated to have any impact on the groups financial statements.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction was issued in July 2007 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2008.
The interpretation addresses when refunds or reductions in future contributions should be regarded as available, and therefore recognised as an asset, in accordance with IAS 19: how a minimum funding requirement might affect the availability of reductions in future contributions: and when a minimum funding requirement might give rise to a liability.
The impact of the interpretation will be dependent on the actuarial position of the groups defined benefit schemes in the future.
IAS 23 revised was issued in March 2007 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2009.
The revision to the standard removes the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale.
Such costs are therefore required to be capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
The revised standard will require Severn Trent to change its existing policy and is likely to result in a proportion of borrowing costs that are currently expensed being capitalised in property, plant and equipment or intangible assets.
The costs will then be amortised over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets.
58 Severn Trent Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Group financial statements 24526 Txt 49 108. qxp 12 6 08 11:19 am Page 59 IAS 1 revised was issued in September 2007 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2009.
The revision is aimed at improving users ability to analyse and compare the information given in financial statements.
The changes made are to require information in financial statements to be aggregated on the basis of shared characteristics and to introduce a statement of comprehensive income.
Since Severn Trent already presents a statement of recognised income and expense, the changes will have no significant impact on the group financial statements.
IAS 27 revised was issued in January 2008 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2010.
The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions with non controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control.
The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost.
Severn Trent has had no transactions in the current or prior year that would have been impacted by the revised standard.
IFRS 3 revised was issued in January 2008 and is required to be implemented by Severn Trent from 1 April 2010.
The standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, with some significant changes.
The directors assess that the other standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective are not applicable to the group.
4 Significant accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the groups accounting policies, the group is required to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available.
The more significant judgments and key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty are summarised below: i Goodwill impairment Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value.
Details of the assumptions used are set out in note 17 to the financial statements.
ii Depreciation and carrying amounts of property plant and equipment Calculating the depreciation charge and hence the carrying value for property, plant and equipment requires estimates to be made of the useful lives of the assets The estimates are based on engineering data and the groups experience of similar assets.
Details are set out in note 2 e. iii Retirement benefit obligations Determining the amount of the groups retirement benefit obligations and the net costs of providing such benefits requires assumptions to be made concerning long term interest rates, inflation, salary and pension increases, investment returns and longevity of current and future pensioners.
Changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the amount of the obligations or the cost of providing such benefits.
The group makes assumptions concerning these matters with the assistance of advice from independent qualified actuaries.
Details of the assumptions made are set out in note 29 to the financial statements.
iv Tax provisions Assessing the outcome of uncertain tax positions requires judgments to be made regarding the result of negotiations with and enquiries from tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions.
The assessments made are based on advice from independent tax advisers and the status of ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities.
v Provisions for other liabilities and charges Assessing the financial outcome of uncertain commercial and legal positions requires judgments to be made regarding the relative merits of each partys case and the extent to which any claim against the group is likely to be successful.
The assessments made are based on advice from the groups internal counsel and, where appropriate, independent legal advice.

This comprised: a charge of 13.9 million in Water and Sewerage and 1.0 million in Corporate arising from the ongoing and developing programme to restructure and realign the business by improving standards through process improvement, enhancements to supporting technology, systems and facilities and the development and retraining of our people: a net cost of 13.6 million arising from the flooding incidents that affected the Water and Sewerage networks during the summer of 2007.
This includes costs of 29.6 million which have been identified to date less insurance recoveries of 16.0 million which have been received.
Costs still to be incurred are expected to relate mainly to the replacement of damaged assets which will be covered by insurance recoveries: a charge of 35.8 million relating to a provision arising from Ofwats proposal to fine Severn Trent Water for misreporting customer service data and failure to meet Guaranteed Standards of Service in 2005 06.
The provision has been recorded on the basis that the best available evidence for making an estimate of the fines that will be payable is Ofwats proposals.
However, Ofwats consultation relating to the fines remains open, and there is a right of appeal at its conclusion, so the amounts that eventually become payable might not be the amounts proposed by Ofwat: and a charge of 4.5 million relating to third party legal costs incurred in the conclusion of a Water Technologies and Services arbitration to settle an interpretation on a long term operating service contract.
2007 A net exceptional credit of 24.7 million arose in respect of continuing operations and an exceptional charge of 24.4 million arose in respect of discontinued operations in the year ended 31 March 2007.
The exceptional credit in continuing operations comprised: a charge of 14.9 million in Water and Sewerage arising from a programme to restructure and realign the business including write off of decommissioned assets 11.9 million and restructuring costs of 3 million: a charge of 16.7 million in corporate costs, arising from the demerger of Biffa Plc, including 7.8 million relating to the settlement of pension obligations, and: a credit of 56.3 million of which 36.2 million arose from the disposal of properties in Severn Trent Water, 14.7 million arose in Water Technologies and Services from the disposal of Aquafin and 5.4 million in Corporate and Other businesses from the disposal of Severn Trent Property and other property assets.
The exceptional charge in discontinued operations comprised: a charge of 31.5 million arising from the impairment of goodwill relating to US Laboratories: a loss of 2.4 million on the sale of US Laboratories: and a gain of 9.5 million on the sale of Biffa Belgium.

The draft Finance Act 2008 includes legislation which would prevent the group from claiming industrial buildings allowances on affected assets after 2011.
It is proposed that this change is introduced by reducing the rate of allowances that may be claimed from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2011 at which point the allowances will be removed.
The directors estimate that, if enacted, the proposed changes would increase the future corporation tax charge by up to 12 million in the three years up to abolition of the allowance.

Severn Trent 67 24526 Txt 49 108. qxp 12 6 08 11:19 am Page 68 Notes to the group financial statements continued 16 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are calculated on the basis of profit from continuing operations attributable to the equity holders of the company.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings 2008 2007 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations being: Profit for the period attributable to the equity holders of the company 209.5 267.1 Adjustment to exclude: Profit for the period from discontinued operations 0.8 20.0 Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 208.7 247.1 Number of shares 2008 2007 m m Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 233.6 232.9 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Share options and LTIPs 1.7 2.2 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 235.3 235.1 Adjusted earnings per share 2008 2007 Pence Pence Adjusted basic earnings per share 97.8 82.4 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 97.1 81.6 Adjusted earnings per share figures are presented for continuing operations.
These exclude the effects of deferred tax, gains losses on financial instruments and exceptional items in both 2008 and 2007.
The directors consider that the adjusted figures provide a useful additional indicator of performance.
The denominators used in the calculations of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as those used in the unadjusted figures set out above.
The adjustments to earnings are as follows: Adjustments to earnings 2008 2007 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 208.7 247.1 Adjustments for: Exceptional fines 35.8 Exceptional flood costs 13.6 Exceptional restructuring costs 14.9 14.9 Exceptional provision for third party legal costs 4.5 Exceptional demerger and related costs 16.7 Exceptional profit on disposal of property and businesses 56.3 Current tax related to exceptional items at 30% 5.6 Losses gains on financial instruments 31.0 48.8 Deferred tax 74.4 18.4 Earnings for the purpose of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share 228.5 192.0 68 Severn Trent Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Group financial statements 24526 Txt 49 108. qxp 12 6 08 11:19 am Page 69 17 Goodwill 2008 2007 m m Cost and net book value At 1 April 49.1 506.3 Impairment of US Laboratories see below 31.5 Disposal of subsidiaries 414.1 Additions 0.4 Adjustment to consideration on acquisitions in prior years 0.3 Exchange adjustments 0.7 11.3 At 31 March 50.2 49.1 Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and business segment.

The group is funded using a mixture of equity and debt including fixed rate, index linked and floating rate.
The groups target for gearing measured by the ratio of net debt to regulatory capital value for the current regulatory period is 60%.
At 31 March 2008 the gearing ratio calculated by this method was 58.0% 2007: 56.4%.
During the year the group issued a further 400 million of 50 to 60 year maturities bonds to the index linked bonds markets.
The group also borrowed 150 million from the European Investment Bank and 199 million via a commercial bank loan.
The group also extended the range of markets from where it obtains funds through a 700 million eight year Eurobond issue, which was entirely swapped into sterling at the issue date.

The group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Discounted cash flows are used to determine fair value for the debt.
Discount rates are derived from yield curves based on quoted interest rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Cross currency swaps and forward exchange contracts are valued by reference to quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
The fair values of the unquoted equity instruments cannot be measured reliably since there is no active market in the instruments.
Hence, the investments are held at cost.
It is not possible to determine a range of estimates within which the fair values are highly likely to lie.
The nominal values less impairment provisions of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the group for similar financial instruments.

The groups overall risk management programme addresses the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance or position.
Financial risks are managed by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the board of directors.
Group Treasury identifies evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non derivative financial instruments and the investment of surplus funds.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates.
The groups policy is that derivative financial instruments are not held for trading.
i Market risk The principal market risks that the group is exposed to are fluctuations in interest rates.
Since substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water which has no significant exposure to changes in exchange rates, the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
Interest rate risk The groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain over 50% of borrowings in fixed rate instruments.
At 31 March 2008 some 70% of the groups net debt was fixed 2007: 69%.
The group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals mainly biannually, the difference between fixed contract and floating rate interest rates calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
The group has entered into a series of long dated interest rate swaps to hedge future debt.
Economically these act to fix debt within the group which is denominated as floating rate, but do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a 24.3 million charge 2007: credit of 52.7 million in the income statement.
Some of the groups debt is index linked, that is its cost is linked to changes in the Retail Price Index RPI.
This debt provides an economic hedge for Severn Trent Waters revenues and regulatory asset values that are also RPI linked under its regulatory regime.

However, since substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water, which has no significant exposure to changes in exchange rates, the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
The group has a significant value of foreign currency debt, primarily in US dollars, yen and euros.
Foreign exchange risk arises when transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
To manage the foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency debt the group enters into cross currency swaps with external parties.
The groups risk management policy is to hedge 100% of all foreign currency denominated debt.
At 31 March 2008 all foreign currency denominated debt was hedged 2007: 100%.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis Since substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water which has no exposure to changes in exchange rates, the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
Monetary assets and liabilities by currency, excluding functional currency Certain of the groups subsidiaries operate in markets where the local currency is different from the functional currency of the operation.
Exchange risks relating to such operations are managed centrally by Group Treasury through forward contracts to buy or sell currency.
External foreign exchange contracts are designated at group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.
The net amount of foreign currency assets and liabilities and the forward contracts that have been taken out to hedge the exchange risks on these assets and liabilities and on future committed transactions are summarised below.

It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water, whose operating licence obliges it to continue to supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid.
Amounts provided against accounts receivable and movements on the provision during the year are disclosed in note 24.
For financing purposes, derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions.
The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.

Group Treasury manages liquidity and flexibility in funding by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and the maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities and by keeping committed credit lines available.
At the balance sheet date the group had the following committed undrawn borrowing facilities available: 2008 2007 m m Expiring within one year Expiring in more than one, but not more than two years 41.7 Expiring in more than two, but not more than five years 458.3 500.0 500.0 500.0 In addition, the group has a committed facility of 80.0 million 2007: 80.0 million, of which up to 60 million may be drawn in the form of money market borrowings and the balance not utilised by such drawings may be drawn as overdraft.
The amount undrawn at the year end was 80.0 million 2007: 47.2 million Financial liabilities analysed by maturity date The following tables detail the groups remaining contractual maturity for its non derivative financial liabilities.

Hedge accounting is adopted for such instruments where the criteria set out in IAS 39 are met.
i Fair value hedges The group raises debt denominated in currencies other than sterling principally US dollar and euro.
Cross currency swaps are entered into at the time that the debt is drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR in order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.
The terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt hence the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.
At the year end the amounts of cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges was as follows: Notional principal amount Fair value 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m US dollar 55.5 56.1 6.7 8.4 Euro 581.0 409.2 21.8 0.5 Yen 251.8 254.8 2.0 55.4 Czech krona 100.3 37.8 24.6 2.4 Other 14.7 14.5 1.9 1.3 1,003.3 772.4 39.6 62.2 ii Cash flow hedges The group has entered into interest rate swap contracts under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the future cash flow exposures arising from issued variable rate debt.
The group has also entered into a number of interest rate swap contracts with start dates set at annual intervals throughout the AMP4 regulatory period.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on debt which is highly probable to be issued over the AMP4 period to fund Severn Trent Waters capital programme and have been accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the balance sheet date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves prevailing at the balance sheet date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
The interest rate swaps settle net on a biannual basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is six months LIBOR.
Details of interest rate swaps that have been accounted for as cash flow hedges are summarised below: Average contract Notional fixed interest rate principal amount Fair value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Period to maturity % % m m m m Less than 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years 4.76 4.74 142.0 236.0 0.1 More than 5 years 5.18 14.7 1.5 0.5 156.7 236.0 1.6 0.5 Changes in the amounts deferred in equity during the period relating to cash flow hedges were as follows: 2008 2007 m m Fair value gains losses deferred in equity at start of the period 4.1 2.4 Fair value losses gains recognised in equity in the period 2.3 6.4 Fair value gains transferred to finance costs in the period 4.6 0.1 Fair value gains deferred in equity at end of the period 6.4 4.1 80 Severn Trent Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Group financial statements 24526 Txt 49 108. qxp 12 6 08 11:19 am Page 81 During the period the group has ceased to account for certain forward start swaps as cash flow hedges because the group was not able to identify specific debt instruments that would enable the strict hedge accounting criteria of IAS 39 to be met when the swaps started.
Fair value losses amounting to 0.5 million relating to these swaps that had been taken directly to equity will be transferred to the income statement on a straight line basis over the remaining lives of the swaps.
Any future changes in the fair values of the swaps will be recorded in the income statement.
Details of interest rate swaps that have not been accounted for as cash flow hedges, including those where hedge accounting has been discontinued in the period, are summarised below: Average contract Notional Contracts where the group pays fixed interest fixed interest rate principal amount Fair value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Period to maturity % % m m m m Less than 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5.34 4.91 213.0 413.0 1.8 1.8 5-10 years 6.32 6.32 235.0 225.0 18.8 13.4 10-20 years 20-30 years 4.83 4.83 560.0 560.0 42.7 35.4 1,008.0 1,198.0 63.3 50.6 During the year the group cancelled swaps with a notional value of 338 million.

There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables.
Prepayments and accrued income include 13.3 million 2007: 8.2 million in respect of amounts due from customers for contract work and 42.4 million 2007: 19.1 million which is recoverable after more than one year.
Credit control policies and procedures are determined at the individual business unit level.
By far the most significant business unit of the group is Severn Trent Water, which represents 82% of group turnover and 67% of trade receivables.
Severn Trent Water has a statutory obligation to provide water and sewerage services to customers within its region.
Therefore there is no concentration of credit risk with respect to its trade receivables and the credit quality of its customer base reflects the wealth and prosperity of all of the commercial businesses and domestic households within its region.
None of the other business units are individually significant to the group.

No asset had been recognised for these losses since it was not considered probable that there would be sufficient taxable profits available against which the losses could be utilised.
In the year ended 31 March 2008 the unused losses have been recognised in full.
The draft Finance Act 2008 involves legislation which, if enacted, would prevent the group from claiming industrial buildings allowances on affected assets after 31 March 2011.
The current best estimate of the impact of this legislation is that it would increase the groups deferred tax liability by 168 million.

The defined benefit schemes are funded to cover future salary and pension increases and their assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out on behalf of the trustees at triennial intervals by an independent professionally qualified actuary.
Under the defined benefit schemes, members are entitled to retirement benefits calculated as a proportion varying between one thirtieth and one eightieth for each year of service of their salary for the final year of employment with the group or, if higher, the average of the highest three consecutive years salary in the last 10 years of employment.
The final salary sections of all of the pension schemes listed below are closed to new entrants and the age profile of scheme participants is expected to rise and hence service costs are also expected to rise in the future.
The UK defined benefit schemes and the date of their last formal actuarial valuation are as follows: UK defined benefit scheme Date of last formal actuarial valuation Severn Trent Pension Scheme STPS 31 March 2004 Severn Trent Senior Staff Pension Scheme SSPS 31 March 2004 Severn Trent Water Mirror Image Pension Scheme 31 March 2006 The STPS is by far the largest of the groups UK defined benefit schemes.
On the demerger of Biffa Plc the company entered into an agreement with that company and the trustees of the STPS, the SSPS and the UK Waste Pension Scheme UKWPS whereby the assets and liabilities relating to Biffa Plc employees in the STPS and the SSPS would be transferred to the UKWPS with effect from 31 March 2007.
The net deficit relating to Biffa Plc employees at the demerger date was 39 million.
This has been included in the net assets that formed the dividend in specie on demerger.
The reduction in the deficit between the demerger date and 31 March 2007 was treated as an exceptional loss on settlement of 7.8 million.
The group has an obligation to pay pensions to a number of former employees, whose benefits would otherwise have been restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
Provision for such benefits amounting to 6.4 million 2007: 7.5 million is included as an unfunded scheme within the retirement benefit obligation.
b Actuarial assumptions The major assumptions used in the valuation of the STPS also the approximate weighted average of assumptions used for the valuations of all group schemes were as follows: 2008 2007 % % Price inflation 3.40 3.00 Salary increases 4.90 4.50 Pension increases in payment and deferred 3.40 3.00 Discount rate 6.40 5.40 Long term rate of return on: Equities 8.00 8.25 Gilts 4.55 4.65 Corporate bonds 6.40 5.40 Property 6.30 6.55 Cash 5.25 5.25 The assumption for price inflation is derived from the difference between the yields on longer term fixed rate gilts and on index linked gilts.
The discount rate is based on the annualised yield from the iBoxx over 15 year AA rated sterling corporate bond index.
At 31 March 2008 the yield on this index was distorted by certain bonds that were exhibiting unusually high yields.
These bonds have been excluded from the calculation of the discount rate.
The expected rate of return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period for returns over the life of the benefit obligation.
For gilts and corporate bonds the expected rates of return are based on market yields at the balance sheet date.
For equities, an equity risk premium has been added to the gilt rate.
The mortality assumptions adopted are based on mortality tables applicable to the sex and year of birth of individual members, with the medium cohort allowance for future improvements in longevity.
For men, the assumptions are based on the 00 series tables and for women, the 92 series, both projected to calendar year 2005 with medium cohort improvements to 2005 and a two year age rating applied.
These have been based on a mortality investigation carried out in conjuction with the STPS, on behalf of the trustees, as at 31 March 2007.
For the year ended 31 March 2007 the revised mortality assumption had not been agreed when the financial statements were approved and the financial impact of the improvements in longevity amongst the scheme members was not known.
The group applied a loading of 4.26% of liabilities as a reserve against longevity improvements, increasing the liabilities at 31 March 2007 by 60 million.
Had the revised mortality assumption been in place at 31 March 2007, the increase in liabilities from this change in isolation would have been 4m less than the loading adopted.

The following table summarises the estimated impact on scheme liabilities and service cost resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.

Derwent Insurance Ltd, a captive insurance company, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the group.
Provisions for claims are made as set out in note 2 t. The associated outflows are estimated to arise over a period of up to five years from the balance sheet date.
The onerous or loss making contract provision relates to specific contractual liabilities either assumed with businesses acquired or arising in existing group businesses, where estimated future costs are not expected to be recovered in revenues.
The associated outflows are estimated to occur over a period of ten years from the balance sheet date.
Provisions relating to terminated operations and disposals include amounts that it is probable will be paid in respect of: claims arising from services performed by these businesses: overseas employee tax liabilities: and the indemnities described in note 38 c. On 8 April 2008, Ofwat published its proposals to fine Severn Trent Water 35.8 million for misreporting customer service data and failure to meet Guaranteed Standards of Service in 2005.
A provision has been made for the full amount of the proposed fine.
The provision has been recorded on the basis that the best available evidence for making an estimate of the fines that will be payable is Ofwats proposal.
However, Ofwats consultation relating to the fines remains open, and there is a right of appeal at its conclusion so the amounts that finally become payable might not be the amounts proposed by Ofwat.
Environmental and landfill restoration provisions reflected costs to be incurred over the operational life of individual landfill sites and in the case of aftercare costs, for up to 30 years thereafter.
Following the disposal of Biffa Belgium and the demerger of Biffa Plc the group no longer has any landfill operations.
Other provisions include a charge relating to third party legal costs incurred in the conclusion of a Water Technologies and Services arbitration to settle an interpretation on a long term operating service contract.

Weekly volatility in the observed data varied between 10% and 20%.
For the 2007 08 award the comparator group is the companies ranked 51-150 in the FTSE index.
Comparator group volatility was therefore based on observed volatility for the FTSE 250 index.
Correlation between Severn Trent and the comparator group was based on the average pairwise correlation for companies in the FTSE 250.
For the 2006 07 award the comparator group volatility was based on the actual observed volatility for the companies within the comparator group and the correlation between Severn Trent and the comparator group was calculated from the average pairwise correlation between Severn Trent and the companies within the comparator group.
The share price at the grant date was 13.70 2007: 11.78.
Dividends paid on shares during the vesting period are accumulated during the vesting period and released subject to achievement of the performance condition, in the same manner as the underlying shares.
As a result a dividend yield assumption is not required.

The contract relating to the disposal of Severn Trent Laboratories Inc required adjustments to the consideration based on the values of certain assets and liabilities in completion accounts drawn up to the date of disposal.
The completion accounts were agreed with the purchasers during the year ended 31 March 2008.
This resulted in a further gain on disposal of 0.8 million which has been included in discontinued operations.

38 Contingent liabilities a Bonds and guarantees Group undertakings have entered into bonds and guarantees in the normal course of business.
No liability is expected to arise in respect of either bonds or guarantees.
b Regulatory matters In May 2004 an employee of Severn Trent Water raised a number of allegations relating, in particular, to alleged accounting inaccuracies and regulatory returns.
On 7 March 2006 Ofwat published its interim report concerning the allegations of false reporting made against Severn Trent Water in 2004.
In responding to the report Severn Trent Plc agreed to credit customers accounts and reduce future tariffs.
The company also acknowledged that Ofwat may expect further amends to be made to customers.
Severn Trent Water has pleaded guilty to two offences relating to leakage data supplied to Ofwat in 2001 and 2002.
A sentencing hearing to determine the amount of the fine began on 2 June 2008 and is due to resume on 1 July 2008.
When concluded, Severn Trent Water will be able to commence discussions with Ofwat concerning further amends to be made to customers.
No reliable estimate can currently be made of the amount that will become payable as a result of the SFO charges or Ofwats final conclusion in respect of the allegations of false reporting.
Consequently no provision has been included in these financial statements in respect of these matters.
c Disposal of subsidiaries The group has given certain guarantees and indemnities in relation to disposals of businesses.
In June 2005 The Flemish Waste Agency OVAM instigated an investigation by the Antwerp Examining Magistrate into Biffa Belgiums waste recycling operations in connection with the payment of environmental taxes.
Two of the Biffa Belgium companies were indicted by the Flemish prosecuting authorities on 13 December 2005.
On 3 March 2008 the company was informed by the purchaser of the Biffa Belgium companies that certain directors of those companies had been summoned to appear before the court in Antwerp.
The Biffa Belgium companies were not summoned.
However, under Flemish law the Biffa Belgium companies may be civilly liable for criminal penalties that may be levied upon the directors.
Severn Trent 93 24526 Txt 49 108. qxp 12 6 08 11:19 am Page 94 Notes to the group financial statements continued 38 Contingent liabilities continued Separately, the Nivelles Public Prosecutor issued a claim on 22 November 2006 against Biffa Belgium that may relate to the same matters investigated in the Flanders region.
Pursuant to the sale agreement of 11 May 2006, the group has given an indemnity in relation to certain costs that may be suffered by the former Biffa Belgium businesses as a result of these proceedings.
A provision of 1.5 million is included in these financial statements for liabilities that may result from this indemnity.
On 5 March 2007 the group received notice of a claim for 23.4 million from Veolia Proprete SA alleging breach of warranty in relation to the disposal of Biffa Belgium.
The group has subsequently received notice from Veolia of a further claim for 5 million relating to the same matter.
The group considers that there is no basis for this claim and hence no provision has been recorded in the financial statements in relation to this matter.
The group is not aware of any other liability that is likely to result from these guarantees and indemnities that has not been provided for in these financial statements.
39 Financial and other commitments 2008 2007 m m Investment expenditure commitments Contracted for but not provided in the financial statements 261.4 242.7 In addition to these contractual commitments, Severn Trent Water has longer term expenditure plans which include investments to achieve improvements in performance mandated by the Director General of Water Services and to provide for growth in demand for water and sewerage services.
