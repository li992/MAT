This company provides reinsurance exclusively accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to certain companies within the Group, principally to cover to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial US casualty, UK employers liability and Group property damage statements.
These actuarial assumptions include discount rates, risks.
Provision is made based on actuarial assessment of the assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates, liabilities arising from the insurance coverage provided.
The and are disclosed in note 29. actuarial assessment of the reserve for future claims necessarily includes estimates as to the likely trend of future claims costs and While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are the estimates as to the emergence of further claims subsequent appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect to the year end.
An actuarial review of claims is performed the balance sheet and income statement.
To the extent that actual claims differ from those that the most sensitive assumptions are the discount rate and projected the provisions could vary significantly.
The Group has estimated the sensitivity of the 2008, the provision for claims arising from this insurance was financial statements to changes in these assumptions as follows: 51 million 2007: 48 million.

For certain agreements the rebate rises as a proportion of purchases as Effect of an increase in life expectancy higher quantities or values of purchases are made.
The Group Increase of 1 year 27 accrues the receipt of vendor rebates as part of its cost of sales for products sold, taking into consideration cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected purchases through to the end of the qualifying period.
Rebates are accrued for each reporting period with an extensive reassessment of the rebates earned being performed at the end of the financial year and half way through the financial year.
The Group has agreements with numerous and geographically dispersed suppliers, but a slowdown in the markets in which the Group operates, or a significant change in the profile of products purchased may result in purchases for the remainder of the year differing significantly from those projected.
Consequently the rebate actually received may vary from that accrued in the financial statements.
Taxation Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates in relation to tax audit issues and exposures.
Amounts accrued are based on managements interpretation of country-specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions are probable of being sustained.
Once considered to be probable, management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on the basis of the potential settlement through negotiation and or litigation.
All such provisions are included in creditors due within one year.
Any recorded exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax charge.

Segmental analysis Wolseleys reportable segments, which are those reported to the Board, are the operating businesses overseen by distinct continental and divisional management teams responsible for their performance.
All reportable segments derive their revenue from a single business activity, the distribution and supply of construction materials and services.
The Groups business is not highly seasonal and its customer base is highly diversified, with no individually significant customer.
The revenue, trading profit and operating profit of the Groups reportable segments are detailed in the following three tables.

Exceptional items Exceptional items are those material items which, by virtue of their size or incidence, are presented separately in the income statement to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
In 2008, the Group recognised exceptional restructuring costs of 76 million before tax.
The costs comprise staff redundancy costs of 32 million and other costs, including provisions for future lease rentals on closed branches and asset write-downs, of 44 million.
There were no exceptional items in 2007 as restructuring costs in that year were not considered to be material 20 million.
Exceptional items before tax are analysed by segment as follows: 2008 2007 m m UK and Ireland 12 France 21 Nordic region 3 Central and Eastern Europe 2 European central costs 4 Europe 42 US plumbing and heating 21 US building materials 6 Canada 5 North American central costs North America 32 Group central costs 2 Group 76 74 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Our business Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information WO40011 R&A 42-124 3 10 08 14:31 Page 75 5.

In 2008, the Group determined that an equity holding in Building Materials Holding Corporation categorised as an available-for-sale investment was impaired.
The cumulative loss as at 31 July 2007 of 13 million that had been recognised in equity has accordingly been recycled from equity and recognised in finance costs along with the 9 million fair value reduction experienced in the year.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share of 11.33 pence 2007: 73.52 pence is calculated on the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of 74 million 2007: 474 million on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by Employee Benefit Trusts, of 655 million 2007: 644 million.
As detailed in note 10 below, the Group believes that profit measures before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements.
Basic earnings per share, before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles, has, therefore, been presented in the following table.
2008 2007 Before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 56.58p 87.80p Add back: exceptional items net of tax 7.62 p Add back: amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles net of deferred tax 37.63 p 14.28 p Basic earnings per share 11.33p 73.52p The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of shares in issue to 656 million 2007: 647 million and therefore reduce basic earnings per share to 11.32 pence 2007: 73.17 pence.
Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is 56.50 pence 2007: 87.39 pence.
Non-GAAP measures of performance Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles.
Exceptional items are material non-recurring items which are excluded from trading profit to enable a clear and consistent presentation of the Groups underlying financial performance.
In addition, the current businesses within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition.
Operating profit includes only the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles arising on those businesses that have been acquired subsequent to 31 July 2004 and as such does not reflect equally the performance of businesses acquired prior to 31 July 2004 where no amortisation or impairment of acquired intangibles was recognised, businesses that have developed organically where no intangibles are attributed and those businesses more recently acquired where amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is charged.
The Group believes that trading profit provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing the Groups performance since it provides information on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly able to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group.
The Group uses trading profit, and certain key performance indicators calculated by reference to trading profit, for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for its internal assessment of the operating performance of individual businesses within the Group.

On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was allocated to cash-generating units CGUs.
These are independent sources of income streams, and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at country, divisional, brand or regional level.
Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five-year financial forecasts approved by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those regarding revenue growth, net margin and the level of working capital required to support trading, which management estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are extrapolated after the five-year period at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate for each market ranging from 1 per cent to 4 per cent, and discounted back to present value.
The discount rate assumptions use an estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital, based on the five-year historic volatility of Wolseley shares and on benchmark interest rates, adjusted for the risk attributable to individual CGUs.
The pre-tax discount rate ranges from 11 per cent to 14 per cent.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 July 2008.
At Stock Building Supply Stock, the US building materials business, the further significant deterioration in the US housing market has continued to adversely affect revenue and trading profit.
The Group has consequently reassessed its shortand medium-term outlook for Stocks cash-generating units and has recognised an impairment loss in the year ended 31 July 2008.
The loss mainly relates to the Texas, Florida, Nevada, New York and Massachusetts regions.
It is calculated on a value in use basis and consists of a 110 million write down of goodwill and a 4 million write down of other acquired intangible assets.
In the year ended 31 July 2007, the Group recognised an impairment loss in respect of the Midwest region of 2 million relating to goodwill and 3 million relating to other intangible assets.
The housing market in Ireland has also deteriorated significantly over the last year, and the Group has revised its expectations about the level of activity which will be sustainable in the long term.
An impairment loss has been calculated on a value in use basis and consists of a 33 million write down of goodwill and a 13 million write down of other acquired intangible assets.
The Groups business in Italy has performed poorly in recent years and the Group has reappraised how long it will take to restore previous levels of profitability.
An impairment loss has been calculated on a value in use basis and consists of a 10 million write down of goodwill and a 1 million write down of other acquired intangible assets.

In 2007 a small amount of software 4 million was acquired with the DT Group.
Other intangible assets arise on business combinations.
Included in the amounts above are 132 million 2007: 60 million relating to assets under construction.
The Group has reduced its planned capital expenditure significantly in the medium term.
As a consequence, certain software assets under development will not be implemented in the short term in as many territories as was originally intended.
As a result of the consequent reduction in anticipated benefits from improved margins, productivity and working capital utilisation, the estimated value in use of these assets has fallen below the accumulated costs to date, and a 15 million impairment loss has been recognised.

All of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 679 million 2007: 650 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the associated temporary deferred tax differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as the Groups customer base is large and unrelated.
Accordingly, management considers that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.
Trade receivables can be aged with respect to the payment terms specified in the terms and conditions established with customers as follows: 2008 2007 m m Amounts not yet due 1,269 1,239 Past due not more than one month 763 822 Past due more than one month and less than three months 316 285 Past due more than three months and less than six months 40 40 Past due more than six months 34 28 Amounts individually determined to be impaired 57 43 2,479 2,457 Other receivables include an amount of 36 million 2007: 35 million which has been discounted at a rate of 4.6 per cent 2007: 5.0 per cent due to the long-term nature of the receivable.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Groups bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR.
Certain interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges, with the valuation gains being deferred in equity until realised.

Certain interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the fair values of these borrowings.
The movement in fair value of these interest rate swaps has been analysed into a proportion that is effective as a hedge, and a proportion that is ineffective: both portions have been charged to the income statement with the effective portion offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged borrowings see note 6.

The contracts expire between September 2008 and November 2020 2007: September 2007 and November 2020, and the gains deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement over that period.
The fixed interest rates vary between 2.488 and 5.415 per cent 2007: 2.313 and 5.415 per cent.

Derivative financial instruments continued Currency swaps The Group uses currency swaps either to obtain the optimum return on its surplus funds or to hedge cash flows in respect of committed transactions.
The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the contracts using market prices at the balance sheet date.
At the balance sheet date the Group had entered into certain short-term currency swaps amounting to assets of 119 million, US$177.5 million, C$5 million, CHF2 million, SEK50 million, DKK1,784 million, HUF1,000 million and SKK59 million 2007: 98 million, US$150 million, DKK640 million and SEK16 million and liabilities of a459 million and C$96 million 2007: a172 million, C$136 million and CHF127 million which were designated and effective as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.

Financial instruments and financial risk management continued b Financial risk management The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international operations, and the financial instruments which fund them.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has well-defined policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have been consistently applied during the financial years ended 31 July 2007 and 2008.
By the nature of its business the Group also has trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated to operating businesses.
There has been no change since the year end in the major financial risks faced by the Group.
The Treasury Committee of the Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies are regularly reviewed.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables, that arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
Derivatives are also used to a limited extent to hedge movements in the price paid for lumber.
These options and futures hedging contracts mature within one year and all are with organised exchanges.
The Groups policy is to control credit risk by only entering into financial instruments with authorised counterparties after taking account of their credit rating.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations are located.
Approximately 44 per cent of the Groups revenue is in US dollars and 21 per cent in Euros.
The Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposure.
However, those that do arise are generally hedged with either forward contracts or currency options.
The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges have only temporary effect.
Most of the foreign currency earnings generated by the Groups overseas operations are reinvested in the business to fund growth in those territories.
The Groups policy is to maintain the majority of its debt in the currencies of its operating companies as this hedges both the net assets and cash flows of the Group.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group, are shown in the Five year summary on page 119.
The net effect of currency translation was to increase revenue by 324 million 2.0 per cent 2007: 776 million, or 5.5 per cent and to increase trading profit by 18 million 2.0 per cent 2007: 51 million, or 5.8 per cent.
These currency effects reflect a movement of the average sterling exchange rate against each of the major currencies with which the Group is involved as follows: 2008 2007 Strengthening Strengthening weakening weakening of sterling of sterling US dollar 2.6 % 8.2 % Euros 10.0% 1.7 % Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank and other borrowings.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies principally at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile, so managing the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at both Treasury Committee and Board meetings.
The Treasury Committee gives prior approval to any variations from floating rate arrangements.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are exposed to both fair value interest rate risk fixed rate borrowings and cash flow interest rate risk floating rate borrowings.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities that comprised the Groups net debt at 31 July 2008 and 31 July 2007, after including the effect of interest rate swaps, are set out in the following tables.

These facilities will only be refinanced when market conditions are appropriate.
During the year ended 31 July 2008 facilities amounting to 645 million matured or were repaid early, and new facilities of 298 million were arranged.
Capital risk management The Group monitors two principal measures of financial gearing, the ratio of net debt to shareholders funds and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.
Over the longer term the Group aims to maintain the ratio of net debt to shareholders funds within the range of 40 per cent to 75 per cent and as at 31 July 2008 the ratio was 73.5 per cent.
The Groups main borrowing facilities all contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
For all facilities agreed after 1 August 2005 this ratio has been set at 3.5.
The Group aims to maintain this ratio generally in the range of 1.5 to 2.3.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amounts of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Credit risk Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers.
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay outstanding balances.
Stock also provides loans to finance the construction of properties.
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay outstanding loan balances.
At 31 July 2008 the maximum exposure to credit risk was 2,830 million 2007: 2,901 million.
Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables.
Significant outstanding and overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are put in place on a timely basis.
In many cases, protection is provided through lien rights on projects or through credit insurance arrangements.
All of the major businesses use professional, dedicated credit teams, in some cases field based.
Historic write-off rates are low and appropriate provisions are made for debts that may be impaired on a timely basis.
Stocks construction loans are secured on the related properties and are managed by a dedicated lending team within that business.
Policies are also applied to provide further protection and KPIs are monitored regularly by management outside the business.
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with financial institutions, and enters into certain contracts such as interest rate swaps which entitle the Group to receive future cash flows from financial institutions.
These transactions give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties.
This risk is managed by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties, all of which have credit ratings equivalent to Standard & Poors A or higher.
The limits are approved by the Treasury Committee, and ratings are monitored regularly.
Market price risk The Group regularly monitors its interest rate and currency risk by reviewing the effect on profit before tax over various periods of a range of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
On the basis of the Groups analysis, it is estimated that the maximum effect of a rise of one percentage point in the principal interest rates on the Groups continuing businesses would result in an increase in the interest charge of approximately 25 million 2007: 17 million.
Similarly, it is estimated that a strengthening of sterling by 10 per cent against all the currencies in which the Group does business would reduce operating profit before amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles by approximately 52 million 9 per cent due to currency translation, with the US dollar reduction being 24 million and the euro reduction being 8 million 2007: 72 million, 45 million and 12 million respectively.
The Group does not require operating businesses to adhere to a formalised risk management policy in respect of trade credit risk or commodity price risk, and does not consider that there is a useful way of quantifying the Groups exposure to any of the macro-economic variables that might affect the collectibility of receivables or the prices of commodities.

Environmental and legal liabilities include known and potential legal claims and environmental liabilities arising from past events where it is probable that a payment will be made and the amount of such payment can be reasonably estimated.
Included in this provision is an amount of 36 million 2007: 35 million related to asbestos litigation involving certain Group companies.
This liability is covered by insurance and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in Other receivables note 18.
The liability has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2008 based on advice from independent professional advisers.
The provision and the related receivable have been stated on a discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 4.6 per cent 2007: 5.0 per cent.
The level of insurance cover available significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
The majority of restructuring provisions fall due within one year.
Other provisions relate to rental commitments on vacant properties, dilapidations on leased properties and warranties.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately nine years.
Retirement benefit obligations i Description of plans United Kingdom The principal scheme operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The schemes retirement benefits are funded by a contribution from employees with the balance being paid by Group companies.
The contribution rates paid by employees at 31 July 2008 are either 5 per cent or 8 per cent of earnings depending on the level of benefits that were accruing at that date.
The Group and employee contribution rates are calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
Outside the United Kingdom North America The principal schemes operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, which are established in accordance with US 401k rules.
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans.
Contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
In the year to 31 July 2008 the cost of defined contribution plans charged to the income statement was 24 million 2007: 24 million.
In addition, the Group operates three defined benefit schemes in the United States.
In Canada a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme are operated.
Two of the US schemes and the Canadian scheme are funded: two plans are closed to new entrants.
The majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution scheme.
The remaining schemes provide benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit credit Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.

Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with actuarial advice.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period in which they fall due.
The cost of defined contribution schemes charged to the income statement was 20 million 2007: 15 million.
Post-retirement health care There are no material obligations to provide post-retirement health care benefits.
The Group expects to contribute 33 million to the UK defined benefit scheme in the year ending 31 July 2009 and 8 million to the non-UK defined benefit schemes.

The expected equity returns can be considered as a risk free rate of return determined by reference to government bond rates in the countries in which the plans are based plus a risk premium to reflect the additional risks associated with equities.
For the UK scheme the expected return implies a premium of 3.4 per cent per year as at 31 July 2008 2007: 3.0 per cent over the expected return from government bonds.
For the principal overseas schemes in the USA, Canada and Switzerland, a similar approach was adopted with returns set by reference to long-term bond rates after taking actuarial advice.
The Groups investment strategy for its funded post-employment plans is decided locally by the Group and, if relevant, the trustees of the plan, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The Groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention being that this will result in the ongoing cost to the Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long term and be within acceptable boundaries of risk.

The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the Group.
For the overseas schemes, the investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels of predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being invested in cash and bonds.

Share-based payments The Group operates seven share option plans: the 1984 Executive Share Option Scheme, the 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme and the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 collectively, the Executive Option Schemes : the Wolseley Employees Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1981, the Wolseley Irish Sharesave Scheme 2000 and the Wolseley European Sharesave Plan 2001 collectively, the Employees Savings Option Schemes : and the Wolseley Employee Share Purchase Plan 2001 the ESPP.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9 per cent and consequently vest over a period of three years.
Awards granted under the Employee Savings Option Schemes vest over periods ranging from three to seven years.
Awards granted under the Employee Share Purchase Plan vest over a one-year period.
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and the Wolseley Restricted Share Plan RSP for senior executives.
Under the LTIS, executives will be awarded a variable number of shares depending on the level of total shareholder return over the next three years relative to that of a number of comparator companies.
The vesting period is three years.
The maximum award under the scheme is determined at grant date, and then adjusted at vesting date in accordance with the market performance condition.
Under the RSP, executives are granted free shares.
The vesting period is three years and there are no performance measures.

The fair value of shares granted under the RSP was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were: Executive Employee Long Term Share Options Share Options Incentive Schemes 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Risk free interest rate 4.93% 4.78% 4.19% 5.34% 4.93% 4.98% Expected annual increase in dividends 10.00% 10.00% 10.00% 10.00% Expected dividend yield 2.94% 2.60% Expected volatility 26.15% 27.07% 31.03% 24.94% 25.00% 22.00% Expected life 5.7 years 5.7 years 17 years 17 years 3 years 3 years The initial assumption was for 2008 interim and final dividends of 11.94 pence and 23.71 pence respectively 2007: 10.84 pence and 21.51 pence respectively.
Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historic volatility over the expected term.
Expected life has been estimated on the basis of historical data on the exercise pattern.

Further adjustments to goodwill may be necessary when additional information is available concerning some of the judgemental areas.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the new markets and product ranges to which the Group has gained access, and to additional profitability and operating efficiencies in respect of existing markets.
The acquisitions contributed 218 million to revenue, 26 million to trading profit and 15 million to the Groups operating profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax, as the Group manages its borrowings as a portfolio and cannot attribute an effective borrowing rate to an individual acquisition.
It is not practicable to disclose profit attributable to equity shareholders, as the complexity of the Groups tax arrangements is such that it cannot attribute an effective tax rate to an individual acquisition.
If each acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue would have been 16,613 million and Group trading profit would have been 689 million.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax or profit attributable to equity shareholders, as stated above.
It is not practicable to disclose operating profit as the Group cannot estimate the amount of intangible assets that would have been acquired at a date other than the acquisition date.

Accounting standards, interpretations of and amendments to published standards not yet effective Certain new standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 August 2008 or later periods, but which the Group has not early adopted.
The new standards which are expected to be relevant to the Groups operations are as follows: Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment effective from 1 August 2009 This amendment clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only.
Other features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions.
It also specifies that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment.
Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment on the Groups financial statements.
Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations and amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements effective from 1 August 2009 These amendments make a number of changes to the method of accounting for business combinations, including a requirement to expense acquisition costs and to measure contingent consideration at fair value at acquisition date, and then record subsequent changes to the estimate in the income statement.
Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements effective from 1 August 2009 This amendment requires information in financial statements to be aggregated on the basis of shared characteristics and introduces a statement of comprehensive income.
Preparers will have the option of presenting items of income and expense and components of other comprehensive income either in a single statement of comprehensive income with subtotals, or in two separate statements a separate income statement followed by a statement of comprehensive income.
Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs effective from 1 August 2009 This amendment requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs, to the extent they are directly attributable to the acquisition, production or construction of assets that need a period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes effective from 1 August 2008 IFRIC 13 addresses accounting by entities that grant loyalty award credits to customers who buy other goods or services.
It requires the award to be accounted for as a separate component of the sale transaction, with the fair value of the award being deferred until the obligation to provide free or discounted goods or services has been redeemed.
Management is currently assessing the impact of this interpretation on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction effective from 1 August 2008 Paragraph 58 of IAS 19 Employee Benefits limits the measurement of the defined benefit asset in a pension plan to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
IFRIC 14 clarifies how to measure this limit in the case of plans subject to a minimum funding requirement.
Management does not expect adoption of this interpretation to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation effective from 1 August 2009 IFRIC 16 provides guidance on identifying the foreign currency risks that qualify as a hedged risk in the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation: where, within a group, hedging instruments that are hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation can be held to qualify for hedge accounting: and how an entity should determine the amounts to be reclassified from equity to profit or loss for both the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
