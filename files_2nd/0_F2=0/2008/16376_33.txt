Shareholder information Shareholder information continued Dividend record Our interim ordinary dividends are normally announced in November and paid in December.
Final ordinary dividends are normally proposed in February and, if approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meetings, paid in June.
The following tables show the dividends paid by NV and PLC for the last five years, expressed in terms of the revised share denominations which became effective from 22 May 2006.
Dividends have been translated into US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of declaration of the dividend with the exception of the proposed final dividend for 2008 see below.
Differences between the amounts ultimately received by US holders of NV and PLC shares are the result of changes in exchange rate between the equalisation of the dividends and the date of payment.
The interim dividend is normally 35% of the previous years total normal dividend per share, based on the stronger of our two parent currencies over the first nine months of the year.
Equalisation of the interim dividend in the other currency takes place at the average exchange rate of the third quarter.
Equalisation of the final dividend takes place at the average exchange rate for the full year.
Final dividends for 2008 are payable on 18 June 2009, subject to approval at the AGMs.
For purposes of illustration, the amounts payable in respect of NV New York Registry Shares and PLC ADRs have been translated in the table below at rates of exchange on 4 February 2009, which was the day before the date on which the proposed dividends were announced.
The actual amounts payable in US dollars will be calculated by reference to the exchange rates on the day on which the dividends are approved 14 May 2009 in the case of NV and 13 May 2009 in the case of PLC.
The dividend timetable for 2008 is shown on page 158.

This will allow us to change to a simpler and more transparent dividend practice for the Unilever group.
These changes will result in more frequent payments to shareholders, and better align with the cash ow generation of the business.
