Political donations 9 That in accordance with section 366 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company and any company which is or becomes a subsidiary of the Company during the period to which this resolution relates be and is hereby authorised: a to make political donations to political parties, political organisations or independent election candidates: and b to incur political expenditure, Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 124 Notice of Annual General Meeting Political donations continued Provided that: i the authority conferred by this resolution shall commence on the date on which it is passed and expire 15 months after the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or adjournment thereof after the passing of this resolution: ii the aggregate amount of such donations and expenditure shall not exceed 50,000 and the amount authorised under each of paragraphs a and b above shall also be limited to such amount: and iii in this resolution the expressions political donation, political parties, political organisation, political expenditure and independent election candidate have the meanings set out in Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006.
Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006 prohibits the Company and its subsidiaries from making donations of more than 5,000 in any twelve month period to a political party or other political organisations or to an independent election candidate unless they have been authorised to make donations by the Companys shareholders.
The Company has a policy that it does not make donations to political parties, political organisations or independent election candidates and the Board will not use these authorities, if given, to do so.
However, the Companies Act 2006 includes broad and ambiguous denitions of political donations and expenditure, which may have the effect of covering some normal business activities, and therefore presents potential for inadvertent or technical breach.
The Board therefore considers that it would be prudent to obtain shareholder approval for the Company to make donations to political parties, political organisations and independent election candidates and to incur political expenditure up to the specified limit in the forthcoming year.
Authority to allot relevant securities 10 a That the directors be and they are hereby generally and unconditionally authorised in accordance with section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 the Act to exercise all the powers of the Company to allot: i relevant securities as dened in section 80 of the Act up to an aggregate nominal amount of 700,000: and ii equity securities as dened in section 94 of the Act up to a further aggregate nominal amount of 700,000 in connection with an offer by way of a rights issue, such authorities to expire 15 months after the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or adjournment thereof after the passing of this resolution.
Notwithstanding such expiry, the authorities shall in each case still permit the Company to make allotments of relevant securities in respect of offers or agreements made before such expiry, which would or might require relevant securities to be allotted after such expiry.
All previous authorities to directors pursuant to section 80 of the Act are hereby revoked without prejudice to any allotment of securities pursuant thereto.
b For the purposes of this resolution rights issue means an offer to ordinary shareholders in proportion as nearly as may be practicable to their existing holdings and, if applicable, to the holders of any other class of equity security in accordance with the rights attached to such class to subscribe further securities by means of the issue of a renounceable letter or other negotiable document which may be traded for a period before payment for the securities is due, subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors may deem necessary or expedient in relation to i fractions of such securities, ii the issue, transfer and or holding of any securities in certicated form or in uncerticated form, iii the use of one or more currencies for making payments in respect of such offer, iv any such shares or other securities being represented by depositary receipts, v treasury shares or vi any legal or practical problems arising under the laws of, or the requirements of any regulatory body or any stock exchange, in any territory.
Paragraph a i of this resolution is proposed annually in order to provide a measure of authority to the directors to allot ordinary shares, limited to approximately 33% of the issued share capital of the Company at 3 March 2009, in circumstances dened by the resolution so as to enable them to respond, in the interests of the Company, to any appropriate opportunities that may arise.
In addition, this resolution seeks to authorise the directors to allot more ordinary shares, limited to the amount set out in paragraph a ii being approximately a further 33% of the issued share capital of the Company at 3 March 2009.
This authority may be used for fully pre-emptive rights issues and is consistent with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers on 31 December 2008.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 125 Notice of Annual General Meeting Notice of Annual General Meeting continued Power to waive pre-emption rights 11 a That the directors be and they are hereby empowered in accordance with section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 the Act to allot equity securities as dened in section 94 of the Act, payment for which is to be wholly in cash: i pursuant to the authority given by paragraph a i of resolution 10 in the notice of this meeting: A in connection with any rights issue, open offer or other pre-emptive offer, open for acceptance for a period determined by the directors, to the holders of ordinary shares on the register on any xed record date in proportion to their holdings of ordinary shares and, if applicable, to the holders of any other class of equity security in accordance with the rights attached to such class, subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors may deem necessary or expedient in relation to i fractions of such securities, ii the issue, transfer and or holding of any securities in certicated form or in uncerticated form, iii the use of one or more currencies for making payments in respect of such offer, iv any such shares or other securities being represented by depositary receipts, v treasury shares or vi any legal or practical problems arising under the laws of, or the requirements of any regulatory body or any stock exchange in, any territory: and B other than pursuant to paragraph a i A above, up to an aggregate nominal amount of 100,000: and ii pursuant to the authority given by paragraph a ii of resolution 10 in the notice of this meeting in connection with a rights issue: as if section 89 1 of the Act did not apply to any such allotment.
References herein to the allotment of equity securities shall include the sale of treasury shares within the meaning of section 162A of the Act.
b The powers given by this resolution shall expire 15 months after the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or adjournment thereof after the passing of this resolution.
Notwithstanding such expiry, the authority shall still permit the Company to make allotments of equity securities in respect of offers or agreements made before such expiry which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry.
All previous disapplications of section 89 1 of the Act are hereby revoked without prejudice to any allotment of securities pursuant thereto.
c For the purposes of this resolution rights issue has the same meaning as in resolution 10 in the notice of this meeting.
This first special resolution seeks authority, limited to approximately 5% of the issued share capital of the Company at 3 March 2009, regarding allotments, other than to members proportionately to their respective shareholdings and for which payment is to be wholly in cash.
Additionally, the resolution seeks authority for the Company to sell or otherwise deal with treasury shares being shares acquired and held by the Company without necessarily involving shareholders.
Over the three years to 31 December 2008, shares with a nominal value of 79,594 were allotted for cash, representing 3.7% of the issued share capital at that date.
This compares with institutional shareholder guideline limits of 7.5% in any three-year period.
Renewal of this limited authority will enable the directors to issue shares, in the interests of the Company, in response to any appropriate opportunities that may arise.
For transactions of a substantial nature involving the allotment of shares, it is normal for the UK Listing Authority or company law to require shareholder approval for the specic transaction notwithstanding this general authority.
Authority to purchase ordinary shares 12 That the directors be and they are hereby granted pursuant to Article 12 of the Articles of Association of the Company general and unconditional authority to make market purchases as dened by section 163 3 of the Companies Act 1985 of any of its ordinary shares of 5p each upon and subject to the following conditions: a the maximum number of ordinary shares in the Company hereby authorised to be acquired is 2,000,000 shares being approximately 5% of the issued share capital of the Company at 3 March 2009 : b the minimum price which may be paid for an ordinary share is 5p: Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 126 Notice of Annual General Meeting
