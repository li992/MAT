Provisions for liabilities and charges Deferred Environmental Emissions Restructuring Taxation Other Total m m m m m m At 1 April 2007 44 1 20 806 41 912 Charged credited to profit and loss account - 4 23 23 7 11 Transferred to reserves - - - 1 - 1 Utilised 1 - 22 - 2 25 Unwinding of discount 1 - - - - 1 At 31 March 2008 44 5 21 784 46 900 The environmental provision represents the net present value of the estimated statutory decontamination costs of old gas manufacturing sites discounted using a nominal rate of 5.0%.
The anticipated timing of the cash flows for statutory decontamination cannot be predicted with certainty, but they are expected to be incurred over the next 50 years.
There are a number of uncertainties that affect the calculation of the provision for gas site decontamination, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
The Company has made its best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties in the calculation of the provision, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the profit and loss account.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2008 relating to gas site decontamination was 69m 2007: 70m, being the undiscounted best estimate of the liability having regard to the uncertainties referred to above.
The provision for emission costs is expected to be settled using emission allowances granted or purchased.
At 31 March 2008, 6m of the total restructuring provision 2007: 7m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties.
The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs, largely to be paid within the next financial year.
Other provisions at 31 March 2008 include 17m 2007: 24m in respect of property transfer costs related to the sales of four UK gas distribution networks and 18m 2007: 17m in respect of employer liability claims.
The payment dates for the property transfer costs are uncertain but should largely be over the next three years.
In accordance with insurance industry practice the estimates for the employer liability claims are based on experience from previous years and, therefore, there is no identifiable payment date.
Deferred taxation comprises: 2008 2007 m m Accelerated capital allowances 784 803 Other timing differences - 3 784 806 Deferred tax assets in respect of capital losses of 18m 2007:nil have not been recognised as their future recovery is uncertain or not currently anticipated.
The capital losses are available to carry forward indefinitely.
The capital losses can be offset against specific types of future capital gains.
There are no other significant unrecognised deferred tax assets or liabilities 2007: nil.

e Litigation and claims On 28 February 2008, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority imposed a 41.6m fine on National Grid Gas plc for infringement of the Competition Act 1998 in relation to a number of metering contracts entered into with gas suppliers in 2004.
We believe that the contracts do not infringe competition law, were entered into voluntarily by gas suppliers and Ofgem was consulted throughout the process of contract development and negotiation.
Therefore, we have lodged an appeal with the Competition Appeal Tribunal.
The fine has been suspended pending the outcome of the appeal and no provision has been made in the accounts.
We remain convinced that The Company has not breached the Competition Act 1998, that our position will be upheld and the fine reversed on appeal.
Related parties Subsequent to the sale of Advantica Limited, a former fellow subsidiary of National Grid plc, on 31 August 2007, the Company purchased services amounting to 9m from Advantica.
