Pensions The primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan that remains open to new employees.
Retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below.
The assumptions used to evaluate accrued pension at 31 December in any year are used to determine pension expense for the following year, that is, the assumptions at 31 December 2008 are used to determine the pension liabilities at that date and the pension expense for 2009.
Financial assumptions % 2008 2007 2006 Expected long-term rate of return 7.5 7.4 7.0 Discount rate for plan liabilities 6.3 5.7 5.1 Rate of increase in salaries 4.9 5.1 4.7 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.0 3.2 2.8 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.0 3.2 2.8 Inflation 3.0 3.2 2.8 In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumption reflects best practice in the UK, and has been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
As part of the triannual valuation of our pension plan, our mortality assumption was reviewed and updated at end-2008 resulting in an increase in the liability of around $800 million.
Mortality assumptions Years 2008 2007 2006 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 25.9 24.0 23.9 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 28.9 25.1 25.0 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 28.5 26.9 26.8 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 31.4 27.9 27.8 The market values of the various categories of asset held by the pension plan at 31 December are set out below.
The market value of pension assets at the end of 2008 is lower compared with 2007 due to a fall in the market value of investments when expressed in their local currencies and a reduction in value that arises from changes in exchange rates reducing the reported value of investments on consolidation when expressed in US dollars.
Movements in the value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail on page 199.
