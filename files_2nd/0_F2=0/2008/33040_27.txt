Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue after deducting the groups shares held by employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.
In calculating the diluted earnings per share, share options outstanding and other potential ordinary shares have been taken into account where the impact of these is dilutive.
Options over 58 million shares 2007: 12 million shares, 2006: 52 million shares were excluded from the calculation of the total diluted number of shares as the impact of these is anti-dilutive.
