Profit before taxation Profit before taxation decreased by 2 million from 2,095 million to 2,093 million in the year ended 30 June 2008.
Taxation The reported effective tax rate for the year ended 30 June 2008 is 24.9% compared with 32.4% for the year ended 30 June 2007.
Factors that increased the reported effective tax rate for the year ended 30 June 2007 were a provision for the settlement of tax liabilities relating to the Guinness GrandMet merger, lower carrying value of deferred tax assets primarily following a reduction in tax rates and the tax impact of an intragroup reorganisation of certain brand businesses.
The underlying effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended 30 June 2008 is 24.5%, compared with 25.1% for the year ended 30 June 2007.
The underlying effective tax rate is expected to be 25% for the year ending 30 June 2009.
Discontinued operations In the year ended 30 June 2008, profit after tax in respect of discontinued operations was 26 million.
This principally arose from a tax credit of 24 million relating to the disposal of the Pillsbury business.
In the year ended 30 June 2007, profit after tax in respect of discontinued operations was 139 million.
This profit represented a tax credit of 82 million in respect of the recognition of capital losses that arose on the disposal of Pillsbury and Burger King and a tax credit of 57 million following resolution with the tax authorities of various audit issues including prior year disposals.
Exchange rates For the year ending 30 June 2009, at current exchange rates, foreign exchange movements excluding the exchange impact under IAS 39 are forecast to increase operating profit by 60 million and increase the interest charge by 15 million.
Dividend The directors recommend a final dividend of 21.15 pence per share, an increase of 5% on last years final dividend.
The full dividend will therefore be 34.35 pence per share, an increase of 5% from the year ended 30 June 2007.

Adjusting the reported tax rate to exclude the net exceptional charges of 69 million and the associated tax credit of 8 million, the group has an underlying effective tax rate of 24.5% on profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2008.
Adjusting the reported tax rate for the year ended 30 June 2007 for the provision for the settlement of tax liabilities relating to the GrandMet Guinness merger, and a lower carrying value of deferred tax assets primarily following a reduction in tax rates, and the tax impact of an intragroup reorganisation of certain brand businesses and excluding the net exceptional income of 39 million which had no associated tax charge, the group had an underlying effective tax rate of 25.1% on profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2007.
ANALYSIS BY BUSINESS AREA AND BRAND In order to assist the reader of the financial statements, the following comparison of 2008 with 2007 includes tables which present the exceptional items, exchange, acquisitions and disposals and organic components of the year on year movement for each of volume, sales, net sales and operating profit.
Organic movements in the tables below are calculated as follows: a The organic movement percentage is the amount in the column headed Organic movement in the tables below expressed as a percentage of the aggregate of the column headed 2007 Reported, the column headed Exchange and the amounts in respect of transfers see note 2 beneath the tables of organic movement calculations and disposals see note 4 beneath the tables of organic movement calculations included in the column headed Transfers, acquisitions and disposals.
The inclusion of the column headed Exchange in the organic movement calculation reflects the adjustment to exclude the effect of exchange rate movements by recalculating the prior period results as if they had been generated at the current periods exchange rates.
Organic movement percentages are calculated as the organic movement amount in million, expressed as a percentage of the prior period results at current period exchange rates and after adjusting for transfers, disposals and exceptional items.
The basis of calculation means that the results used to measure organic movement for a given period will be adjusted when used to measure organic movement in the subsequent period.
b Where a business, brand, brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of, or terminated, in the current period, the group, in organic movement calculations, adjusts the results for the comparable prior period to exclude the amount the group earned in that period that it could not have earned in the current period i. e. the period between the date in the prior period, equivalent to the date of the disposal in the current period, and the end of the prior period.
As a result, the organic movement numbers reflect only comparable performance.
Similarly, if a business was disposed of part way through the equivalent prior period, then its contribution would be completely excluded from that prior periods performance in the organic movement calculation, since the group recognised no contribution from that business in the current period.
In the calculation of operating profit, the overheads included in disposals are only those directly attributable to the businesses disposed of, and do not result from subjective judgements of management.
For acquisitions, a similar adjustment is made in the organic movement calculations.
For acquisitions subsequent to the end of the equivalent prior period, the post acquisition results in the current period are excluded from the organic movement calculations.
For acquisitions in the prior period, post acquisition results are included in full in the prior period but are only included from the anniversary of the acquisition date in the current period.
c Organic movement in operating margin is the difference between the 2008 operating margin operating profit adjusted for exceptional items expressed as a percentage of sales and an operating margin where the amounts for each of sales and operating profit are the aggregate of those captions in the column headed 2007 Reported, the column headed Exchange and the amounts in respect of transfers see note 2 beneath the tables of organic movement calculations and disposals see note 4 beneath the tables of organic movement calculations included in the column headed Transfers, acquisitions and disposals.
Organic movement in operating margin is calculated as the movement amount in margin percentage, expressed in basis points, between the operating margin for the prior period results at current period exchange rates and after adjusting for transfers, disposals and exceptional items and the operating margin for the current period results adjusted for current period exceptional items.

2 Transfers represent the movement between operating units of certain activities, the most significant of which were the reallocation of certain net operating items between Corporate and the regions.
Transfers reduced operating profit for International, Asia Pacific and Corporate by 5 million, 4 million and 1 million respectively and increased operating profit in North America and Europe by 4 million and 6 million respectively.
3 The exchange adjustments for sales, net sales and operating profit are principally in respect of the US dollar and the euro.
4 Acquisitions in the year ended 30 June 2008 that affected sales, net sales and operating profit were the acquisition of Rosenblum Cellars, Ketel One Worldwide BV and the distribution rights for Zacapa rum, which contributed volume, sales, net sales and operating costs of 65,000 equivalent units, 7 million, 7 million and 1 million, respectively, in the year ended 30 June 2008.
The only disposal affecting the year was the disposal of the distribution rights of certain champagne brands, which contributed volume, sales, net sales and operating profit of 6,000 equivalent units, 6 million, 6 million and 1 million, respectively, in the year ended 30 June 2007.
5 Operating exceptional items in the year ended 30 June 2008 comprised restructuring costs for the Irish brewing operations of 78 million.
Operating exceptional items in the year ended 30 June 2007 comprised a gain on the disposal of land at the Park Royal site of 40 million.

Overall volume growth was driven by the priority brands.
Price increases on 40% of spirits volume in the United States drove net sales growth despite negative mix within the global priority brands due to the strong growth of Smirnoff and Captain Morgan.
The continued challenges in the ready to drink segment reduced overall volume growth by 1 percentage point and net sales growth by 2 percentage points.
Marketing spend grew 3% as investment was realigned behind the priority and reserve brands and away from ready to drink.
Marketing excluding ready to drink grew 5%.
Diageo grew share on the majority of its priority spirits and wine brands.
Loss of share in the value brands resulted in overall share of US spirits being broadly maintained during the year at 28.3 percentage points, with share of priority spirits brands up 0.3 percentage points.
In Canada share gains of 1.0 percentage points were delivered in the spirits category.
Volume grew 6% driven by the global priority brands and net sales were up 9% as price increases were implemented.
Smirnoff continued its strong performance from the first half and grew volume 8%.
Price increases were taken in key markets driving net sales growth of 12% and share grew 0.2 percentage points.
Growth of Smirnoff Red was driven by two successful advertising campaigns, the Diamonds programme and Vladimirs Journey, which reinforced the quality image of the brand and its heritage.
Smirnoff flavours were driven by the launch of three new flavours: Blueberry, Passion Fruit and White Grape and the Simple Drinks campaign, which taught consumers simple ways of making drinks at home with flavoured vodka.
Johnnie Walker also grew ahead of the category with volume up 5% and net sales up 10% driven by Johnnie Walker Black Label and the super deluxe labels, leading to share growth of 1.2 percentage points.
Price increases were taken across the Johnnie Walker range.
Expansion of the Johnnie Walker Blue Label bottle engraving programme and the distribution of Johnnie Walker Blue Label King George V drove growth of the super deluxe labels and improved mix.
Captain Morgan volume was up 7% and net sales were up 12% driven by Captain Morgan Original Spiced rum which gained a further 0.6 percentage points of share despite the launch of two competitor brands in the rum category.
Successful marketing campaigns around holidays and the Pose-off contest continued to build this iconic brand.
The overall Baileys results were constrained by lower volume in Baileys flavours, which lapped the launch in fiscal 2007.
Baileys Original Irish Cream outperformed the category with volume up 3% and net sales up 7% as price increases were taken across most of its markets.
Strong year round marketing support of the brand along with summer programming for Baileys Shiver helped drive the growth.
37 212833 DIAGEO REPORT P28-71 5 9 08 10:08 Page 38 DIAGEO | ANNUAL REPORT 2008 OPERATING RESULTS 2008 COMPARED WITH 2007 CONTINUED The release of Jos Cuervo Platino in the first half of 2008 to good consumer response is one of the ways Jos Cuervo is positioning itself in an increasingly premiumising category.
Jos Cuervo Especial experienced heavy pricing competition and volume decreased 5% as the Jos Cuervo brand maintained price and in some states increased it, to support the premiumisation of the brand.
Marketing spend on Jos Cuervo was weighted toward the summer season and promoted the mixability of the brand.
Tanqueray again outperformed a declining gin category, gaining 1.6 percentage points of share driven by the continued growth of Tanqueray Rangpur.
Crown Royal continued to take share in the North American whiskey category, up 0.4 percentage points.
Volume grew 5% and price increases drove net sales up 9%.
Crown Royal Cask 16, launched in October 2007, helped to drive mix.
The brand was supported by two off trade promotions, the Legend of the Purple Bag and Id Rather Be as well as its continued sponsorship of NASCAR.
Guinness showed good growth against the import segment which was broadly flat, with volumes up 5% driven by keg sales and Guinness Extra Stout.
Net sales grew 7% as price increases were implemented.
The brand was supported by a new advertising campaign, Guinness Alive Inside.
The local priority brands grew volume 3% and net sales were up 8%, benefiting from price increases and mix improvement from the higher margin spirits brands.
Crown Royal led this performance.
Buchanans volume was up 18% and net sales up 24% and Seagrams 7 Crown and Seagrams VO grew net sales 4% and 1%, respectively, on flat volumes.
Local priority wines grew volume 6% and net sales were up 8%, driven by strong performance of Sterling Vineyards and Chalone Vineyard and price mix improvement in Beaulieu Vineyards.
Within the category brands, mix improvement was driven by strong growth of Don Julio volume up 19% and net sales up 22%, the Classic Malts volume up 14% and net sales up 19%, Bushmills volume up 13% and net sales up 16% and Croc volume up 89% and net sales up 90% on strong marketing and distribution gains.
Successful marketing of Smithwicks Irish heritage delivered strong growth albeit off a low base with volume up 19% and net sales up 20% following national price increases.
This offset net sales declines among the value brands such as Gordons vodka, net sales down 10% and Gordons Gin, down 1%.
The ready to drink segment continued to decline with volume down 13% and net sales down 10%.
This was driven by progressive adult beverages, led by the decline of Smirnoff Ice.
Smirnoff Ice Light, Smirnoff Ice Strawberry Acai and Captain Morgan Parrot Bay Mojito were introduced in the second half of the year to help refresh the segment.
The decline in progressive adult beverages was partially offset by the success of the recently launched Smirnoff cocktail line which has performed very well to date.
Consequently marketing spend has been reduced on progressive adult beverages and support provided to the spirit based cocktails.
On 9 June 2008, Diageo completed the acquisition of a 50% equity stake in the newly formed company Ketel One Worldwide BV, which holds the exclusive and perpetual rights to market, sell and distribute Ketel One vodka products.

Strong volume growth in Great Britain, driven by Smirnoff and Baileys, and in Eastern Europe and Russia, was partially offset by continued volume weakness in Iberia.
Price increases across Europe, combined with focus on the premium spirit brands, offset negative market mix from the rapid growth in Eastern Europe and resulted in net sales up 3%.
Global priority brands were the key growth driver with volume up 3% and net sales up 4%.
Johnnie Walker was the main contributor with double-digit net sales growth.
J&B, Smirnoff and Baileys also performed strongly and Guinness continued its positive performance from the first half, delivering net sales growth for the full year.
Smirnoff volume was up 6% and net sales were up 5%.
This performance was driven by Great Britain where new advertising campaigns and a successful Christmas trading period drove volume up 10%.
Net sales were up 8% as a simplified promotional strategy led to higher volume but an increased percentage of that volume being sold on promotion.
Within Continental Europe, negative market mix generated by the growth of Smirnoff Vladimir in Poland was partially offset by price increases and the growth of Smirnoff Black as it was seeded across a number of markets.
Johnnie Walker volume was up 6%, driven by growth in Eastern Europe and Russia, both of which were up over 30%, albeit off a small base.
Consistent advertising has increased awareness and the status of the brand in these markets.
This growth was partially offset by declines in Iberia and Greece.
Net sales were up 11% as a result of price increases and mix improvement as investment focused on Johnnie Walker Black Label and Johnnie Walker super deluxe labels.
Baileys returned to growth in Great Britain and delivered strong growth in Russia, resulting in overall volume and net sales up 4%.
In Great Britain a return to advertising on television and a revised promotional strategy at Christmas drove the brand back to growth.
In Russia Baileys continued to demonstrate great potential with net sales growth of 37%, albeit off a small base.
In Continental Europe net sales were flat as the brand lapped the Baileys flavours launch in the prior year.
J&B returned to growth in Europe supported by the Start a Party advertising campaign and expansion across Continental Europe.
In Iberia category volume declines worsened, however J&B delivered net sales growth and share gains as further price increases were implemented.
Within Continental Europe, France and Eastern Europe were the main growth drivers.
In France a price increase was implemented and J&B gained share.
In Romania and Bulgaria, the brands biggest markets in Eastern Europe, the Start a Party campaign has delivered strong growth.
Guinness volume was flat and net sales were up 3% as the brand continued to outperform the beer categories in both Ireland and Great Britain.
This was the result of new advertising campaigns, focus on quality and the cooler summer of 2007.
In Ireland net sales were up 2% and share gains were made in both the on and off trade, driving an overall share gain for Diageo Ireland in the beer category.
In Great Britain the beer category worsened in the second half.
However, Guinness net sales were up 2% as it continued to outperform the category, particularly in the on trade where it recorded its highest ever share.
Volume was up 3% in the rest of Europe as a result of growth across a number of markets which, combined with price increases, led to net sales up 6%.
Local priority brand volume was down 3% and net sales were down 2%.
This was driven by beer in Ireland and Cacique in Spain.
Local beer brands in Ireland declined, impacted by the continued decline of the beer category in the on trade and the decision to reduce the volume sold on promotion in the off trade.
Carlsberg, however, delivered net sales growth as a result of distribution gains and a new advertising campaign and gained share.
In Spain lower volumes of Cacique were partially offset by price increases.
Category brands delivered price mix improvement with volume flat and net sales up 4%, as a result of price increases on category scotch brands and the strategy to drive net sales from wine through a change in promotional strategy and mix improvement.
Ready to drink continued to decline, driven by Smirnoff Ice in Great Britain.
The segment now accounts for less than 5% of net sales in the region.

Following the loss of Diageos import licence in Korea, the route to market was through a third party distributor for part of the year.
There was a reduction in net sales per case, marketing spend and operating profit in Korea and this had a significant impact on the overall performance of Asia Pacific for the year.
Excluding Korea net sales increased 5% and marketing increased 4%.
In addition, overheads increased to support the future performance in the region with the establishment of in market companies in China and Vietnam, increased resources behind the Indian domestic route to market and the creation of the distribution hub in Singapore.
Smirnoff grew volume 20% and net sales 29%.
This performance was driven by double-digit volume and net sales growth in India, Australia and Thailand.
The focus on Smirnoff flavours in India and Smirnoff Black and flavours in Australia drove the overall price mix improvement.
A significant increase in marketing spend fuelled performance in Thailand.
The brand grew share in all these markets.
Johnnie Walker volume was marginally down, with volume decline in India as a result of the closure of the duty free channel which was only partially offset by the growth of sales in the domestic channel, in Australia where net sales grew as a result of significant price increases and in Taiwan where the scotch category declined but Johnnie Walker gained share.
In China Johnnie Walker grew volume 7% in the second half.
Therefore volume was flat for the year, recovering from the 8% decline in the first half.
Full year net sales increased 4%, following a 10% decline in the first half.
Consumer demand continued to strengthen and Johnnie Walker gained an estimated 3 percentage points of volume share in the growing deluxe scotch segment in China.
In Thailand Johnnie Walker grew net sales 5% and Diageo remained the market leader in both premium and deluxe scotch.
Across the region net sales grew 4% on the back of price increases.
Marketing spend was broadly in line with last year.
Windsor volume increased 7% whilst net sales were down 12% as a result of having to pay distributor margin in Korea for part of the year.
Consistent marketing activity throughout the year extended Windsors leading share within deluxe scotch by 1.1 percentage points in volume terms.
Guinness volume was up 1% and net sales up 6%, with increased distribution and successful consumer promotions driving strong double-digit net sales growth in Korea and with the expansion of the brand in China following a new distribution agreement, supported by significant marketing activity.
Overall performance of local priority brands was impacted by Korea, with volume up 4% but net sales down 7%.
Excluding Korea volume was up 2% and net sales were up 3%.
This was driven by Bundaberg in Australia, with volume up 5% and net sales up 6% as a result of strong sales of Bundaberg ready to drink prior to the significant increase in duty which was implemented at the end of April and, after this duty increase, an uplift in Bundaberg spirit sales.
This was partially offset by declines in Old Parr and Dimple.
45 212833 DIAGEO REPORT P28-71 5 9 08 10:08 Page 46 DIAGEO | ANNUAL REPORT 2008 OPERATING RESULTS 2008 COMPARED WITH 2007 CONTINUED The volume of category brands in the region was down 4%, however net sales value grew 6% as a result of continued focus on improving profitability of scotch brands in Thailand where low value brands were discontinued.
The growth of locally bottled scotch brands in India, together with the growth of bottled in India brands in other categories, enhanced Diageos route to market there and offset much of the volume decline in category scotch brands.
The growth of The Singleton malt whisky in Greater China further contributed to price mix improvement.
The Australia ready to drink segment represents over 90% of ready to drink net sales in the region.
Ready to drink brands in Australia performed strongly for the first 10 months of the year but slowed significantly following a 70% duty increase in April 2008, and for the full year volume declined 2% and net sales were down 1% for the region.
For the year ending 30 June 2009, it is expected that the increase in excise duty in Australia will reduce operating profit by 25 million.
As previously reported, Diageo Korea and several of its current and former employees have been subject to investigations by Korean authorities regarding various regulatory and control matters.
