FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 16.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost, less subsequent depreciation and impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life as follows: Buildings life of the lease Equipment 3-10 years Major renovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset or to the date of the next major renovation, whichever is sooner.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
