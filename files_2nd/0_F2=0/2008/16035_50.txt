BORROWINGS continued h Guarantees and security There are cross guarantees on the overdrafts between group companies.
The companies listed in note 18, with the exception of Benchmarx Kitchens and Joinery Limited and Tile Giant Limited, together with Wickes Limited are guarantors of the following facilities advanced to Travis Perkins plc: 525m term loan: 475m revolving credit facility: $400m unsecured senior notes note 24 i : Interest rate and currency derivatives, note 25.
The group companies have entered into other guarantee and counter-indemnities arrangements in respect of guarantees issued in favour of group companies by the clearing banks amounting to approximately 13.2m 2007: 19.4m.
i Unsecured senior notes On 26 January 2006 the Group finalised a US private placement that resulted in it receiving $400m.
$200m of the unsecured senior notes is repayable in January 2013 and $200m in January 2016.
The US borrowings carry fixed rate coupons of between 130 bps and 140 bps over US treasuries.
As described in note 25, to protect itself from currency movements and bring interest rate exposures back into line with the Groups desired risk profile the Group entered into five cross currency swaps.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Fair value of financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and applicable yield curves from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.

The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Interest rate swaps The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is either on a fixed rate basis or is subject to movements within pre-defined limits.
To achieve its desired interest rate profile the Group uses interest rate swaps and interest rate collars.
As part of their interest rate management processes, in respect of the facilities described in note 24, the Group and the Company are parties to two amortising interest rate swaps, four non-amortising interest rate swaps, two non amortising interest rate swaps with a call option, with one amortising interest rate floor option and an amortising interest rate cap option.
Two amortising interest rate swaps each have a notional value of 118.5m, the remaining non-amortising swaps have notional values of 50m each.
The interest rate cap and floor options provide a collar on 118.5m of borrowings between rates of 4.21% and 5.7%.
Contracts with nominal values of 537m have fixed interest payments at an average rate of 4.95% for periods up until October 2013 and have floating interest receipts equal to 6 month LIBOR.
At 31 December 2008 the fair value of interest rate derivatives, all of which terminate between 1 year and five years from the balance sheet date, to which the Group and the Company were parties was estimated at 25.8 m 2007: 3.6m.
This amount is based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps excluding those with a call option are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
An amount of 2.7 m 2007: 0.6m in respect of the fair value movement on the cap and floor has been taken to the income statement through net finance charges as the Company has not applied hedge accounting.
An additional amount of 6.0 m 2007: nil in respect of the fair value movement on interest rate swaps with a call option has been taken to the income statement through net finance charges as the Company has not applied hedge accounting.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts as at the reporting date: Cash flow hedges outstanding receive floating pay fixed contracts Average contract Notional principal fixed interest rate amount Fair value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % m m m m 1 to 2 years 4.95 - 237.0 - 4.2 - 2 to 5 years 5.02 4.95 200.0 278.0 13.5 3.0 Greater than 5 years - 5.07 - 50.0 - - 437.0 328.0 17.7 3.0 The interest rate swaps settle on a half yearly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 6 months LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest rate payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.
Currency swaps In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the $400m unsecured senior notes described in note 24 i the Group and the Company have entered into five cross currency swaps in varying amounts between 23m and 63m to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire lives of the unsecured loan notes, although there is a mutual break clause on each swap on 1 December 2010.
The forward options fix the notional amount receivable and payable in respect of the unsecured senior notes to 231m as well as fixing the exchange rate applicable to future coupon payments.
The currency swaps manage the Groups and the Companys exposure to the fixed interest rate on the US dollar denominated borrowing arising out of a private placement on 26 January 2006.
There are two interest rate swaps of 58m that convert the borrowing rate on $200m of debt from 5.77% to a variable rate on 6 month LIBOR plus a weighted average basis point increment of 81.9.
At 26 January 2006 the variable rates were both at 5.43%.
A further three interest rate swaps of 29m, 23m and 63m convert the borrowing rates on US$50m, US$40m and US$110m of debt from 5.89% to a variable rate based on six month LIBOR plus basis point increment of 86.5, 86.7 and 86.05 respectively.
At 26 January 2006 the variable rates were at 5.47 weighted average %.
At 31 December the fair value of currency derivatives was estimated at 80.3m 2007: 29.8 m. All of these currency swaps are designated and effective as fair value hedges.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Fair value hedges outstanding receive fixed pay floating contracts Average contract Notional principal floating interest rate amount Fair value 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 % % m m m m 2 to 5 years 6.6 - 115.6 - 35.8 - Greater than 5 years 6.6 7.0 115.6 231.2 44.5 29.8 231.2 231.2 80.3 29.8 The interest rate swaps settle on a half yearly basis.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest on a net basis.
Interest rate swap contracts exchanging fixed rate interest for floating rate interest are designated and effective as fair value hedges in respect of interest rates.
During the period, the hedge was 100% effective in hedging the fair value exposure to interest movements and as a result, the carrying amount of the loan was adjusted by 108.2m 2007: 2.3m, which was included in profit or loss at the same time that the fair value of the interest rate swap was included in profit or loss.
The Group acquires goods for sale from overseas, which when not denominated in Sterling are paid for principally in US dollars.
The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts all of which are less than one year in duration to buy US dollars to hedge the exchange risk arising from these anticipated future purchases.
At the balance sheet date the total notional value of contracts to which the Group was committed was US$46m 2007: US$17m.
The fair value of these derivatives is 2.4m 2007: 0.1 m. These contracts have not been designated as hedges and accordingly the fair value movement has been reflected in the income statement.
The following table details the Groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instrument that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows and outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date.

For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: Profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2008 wo uld have decreased increased by 7m 2007: increased decreased by 5m including 4m 2007: decreased increased by nil of movement on interest rate swaps with options: Net equity would have decreased increased by 11m 2007: decreased increased by 2m mainly as a result of the changes in th e fair value of interest rate derivatives.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period mainly due to the increase in the nominal value of interest rate derivatives.
