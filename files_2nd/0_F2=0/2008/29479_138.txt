This is as a result of the variable maturity values of the financial liabilities as a consequence of future policyholder investments and withdrawals as well as investment return.
The contractual value required to be paid to the policyholder as at 31 December 2008 would not be materially different from the investment contract benefits value in the table above.

Financial assets and liabilities held outside unitised funds primarily consist of fixed interest securities, units in money market funds, cash and cash equivalents, and other assets and liabilities.
The fixed interest securities are held to match non linked liabilities and the liability values move broadly in line with the matching asset values such that fair value interest rate risk is immaterial, although these is some residual risk due to imperfect matching.
Cash held in unitised money market funds and at bank is valued at par and is unaffected by movement in interest rates.
Other assets and liabilities are similarly unaffected by market movements.
As a result of these combined factors, the Groups financial assets and liabilities held outside unitised funds are not materially subject to market risk, and movements in interest rates and equity values have an immaterial impact on the Groups profit after tax and equity.
