The principal restructurings in 2008 and 2007 are as described in note 3 e. While some elements of the noncurrent provisions of 76 million will unwind over several years, as termination payments are made over extended periods in some countries, it is estimated that over 50 per cent will unwind in 2010 and approximately 80 per cent within 5 years.
Provisions in respect of acquired businesses mostly relate to those which were part of the integration of the Rothmans businesses in 1999, the transition of Imperial Tobacco Canada to a subsidiary in 2000 and the reorganisation of the Italian business acquired in 2003.
While some elements of the non-current provisions of 8 million will unwind over several years, it is estimated that around 50 per cent will unwind within 5 years.
Employee-related benefits mainly relate to long-term employee benefits other than post-retirement benefits.
As the principal components of these provisions are long service awards and jubilee payments due after a certain service period, they will unwind over several years.
It is estimated that approximately 45 per cent of the non-current provisions of 26 million will unwind within 5 years.
Other provisions comprise balances set up in the ordinary course of general business that cannot be classified within the other categories, such as sales returns, onerous contracts and the age verification scheme in Japan, together with amounts in respect of supplier, excise and other disputes.
The nature of the amounts provided in respect of disputes is such that the extent and timing of cash flows is difficult to estimate and the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided.
Amounts provided above are shown net of reversals of unused provisions which include 20 million 2007: 10 million for restructuring of existing businesses, 6 million 2007: 3 million for acquired businesses, nil 2007: nil for employee related benefits and 15 million 2007: 24 million for other provisions.
