78 THE GAME GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007-2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 January 2008 17 FINANCIALINSTRUMENTS CONTINUED c Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated, for example a change in interest rate and a change in foreign currency interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis prepared by management for foreign currency risk and interest rate risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
At 31 January 2008, if interest rates on the oating rate borrowings denominated in sterling had been 100 basis points higher with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the period would be 1,037,910 lower 2007: 468,461 lower.
At 31 January 2008, if interest rates on the oating rate borrowings denominated in euros had been 100 basis points higher with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the period would have been 173,231 lower 2007: 106,797 lower.
The Directors consider that 100 basis points is the maximum likely change to sterling and euro interest rates over the next year, being the period up to the next point at which the Group expects to make these disclosures.
The Directors do not consider that any reasonably possible change in the interest rates attached to the Australian dollar debt would have a significant effect on the Group.
The tables in a and b above present financial liabilities and assets denominated in foreign currencies held by the Group in 2008 and 2007.
If the euro weakened or strengthened by 10 per cent against sterling, with all other variables held constant, profit after tax and equity would move by 352,146.
If the Australian dollar weakened or strengthened by 10 per cent against sterling, with all other variables held constant, profit after tax and equity would move by 205,562. d Fair value of borrowings and financial assets Set out below is an analysis of all the Groups borrowings and financial assets by category.
The fair value of oating rate borrowings is the amortised cost because the interest rate payments are based on market value.
2008 2007 000 000 Trade and other receivables 33,295 13,642 Net cash and cash equivalents 137,899 32,927 Current portion of long-term debt 38,038 4,477 Non-current portion of long-term debt 57,809 27,827 There is no material difference between the book value and current value of these borrowings.
e The Group had no material monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.
f As at 1 April 2008, the Group had undrawn working capital facilities available to it of 15.9 million 2007: 48.8 million and Euro nil 2007: Euro nil.
There are no significant conditions attached to these facilities.

The Group expects increased competition from food retailers who are expanding their range of non-food items.

Turnover, operating profit and cash ow may be adversely impacted by variations in demand during this period.
Technology Playing games online is a growing part of the market, whereby software content is sent digitally, direct from the publisher to the gamer.
This may lead to reduced product sales for mainline retailers.
