Financial statements 59 Meggitt PLC Report and accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial risk factors The Groups operations expose it to a number of financial risks including foreign exchange risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
These risks are managed by a centralised treasury department, in accordance with Board approved objectives, policies and authorities.
Regular reports monitor exposures and assist in managing the associated risks.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is subject to foreign exchange risks on future commercial transactions and net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The principal exposures arise with respect to the US dollar against the Pound sterling.
To mitigate risks associated with future commercial transactions the Group policy is to hedge known, and certain forecast transaction exposures based on historical experience and projections.
The Group hedges at least 70% of the next 12 months anticipated exposure and can hedge up to five years ahead.
The Group uses borrowings denominated in the relevant currencies to hedge its investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Details of the hedges in place can be found in note 32. Credit risk The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a large number of companies across the world.
In addition, many of the Groups principal customers are either government departments or large multinationals.
Policies are maintained to ensure the Group makes sales to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Letters of credit or other appropriate instruments are put in place to reduce credit risk where considered necessary.
The Group is also subject to credit risk on the counterparties to its other financial instruments which it controls through only dealing with highly rated counterparties and netting transactions on settlement wherever possible.
Interest rate risk The Group has borrowings issued at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk whereas floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is to maintain at least 25% of its net debt at fixed rates.
The Group mitigates interest rate risks through swaps which have the economic effect of converting fixed rate borrowings into floating rate borrowings and floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings.
Details of the hedges in place can be found in note 32.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains sufficient committed facilities to meet projected borrowing requirements based on cash flow forecasts.
Additional headroom is maintained to protect against the variability of cash flows and to accommodate small bolt-on acquisitions.
Key ratios are monitored to ensure continued compliance with covenants contained in the Groups principal credit agreements.
The following table analyses the Groups financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date.

The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the Groups results to changes in these key variables as at the balance sheet date.
The analysis covers only financial assets and liabilities held at the balance sheet date and is made on the basis of the hedge designations in place on the relative dates and assuming no hedge ineffectiveness.

However, as all US dollar debt is designated as a net investment hedge, the impact is entirely offset by the retranslation of overseas operations.
Capital risk management The Groups objective when managing its capital structure is to minimise the cost of capital while maintaining adequate capital to protect against volatility in earnings and net asset values.
The strategy is designed to maximise shareholder return over the long term.
The relative proportion of debt to equity will be adjusted over the medium term depending on the cost of debt compared to equity and the level of uncertainty facing the industry and the Group.
The capital structure of the Group at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Obligations under finance leases current see note 29 1.0 0.5 Bank and other borrowings current see note 30 13.5 16.7 Obligations under finance leases non-current see note 29 6.2 5.0 Bank and other borrowings non-current see note 30 1,094.5 858.1 Less cash and cash equivalents see note 26 67.3 64.9 Total net debt 1,047.9 815.4 Total equity 1,286.4 1,063.4 Debt equity % 81% 77% 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS In applying the Groups accounting policies set out in note 2 management is required to make certain estimates and judgements concerning the future.
These estimates and judgements are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary.
The estimates and judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows: Goodwill Each year the Group carries out impairment tests of its goodwill balances which requires estimates to be made of the value in use of its cash generating units CGUs.
These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of the future cash flows and long-term growth rates of the CGUs.
Further details on these estimates are provided in note 19.
Development costs and programme participation costs The Group capitalises development costs and programme participation costs provided they meet certain criteria as set out in note 2.
Costs are only capitalised where management are satisfied as to the ultimate commercial viability of the project based on available information.
Projects typically involve long-term relationships on aircraft platforms and in assessing commercial viability, estimates need to be made of future revenues, margins and cashflows which are dependent on a number of factors including the size, utilisation and life of the aircraft fleet to which the capitalised costs relate.
Fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination On the acquisition of a business it is necessary to attribute fair values to any intangible assets acquired provided they meet the criteria to be recognised.
The fair values of these intangible assets are dependent on estimates of attributable future revenues, margins and cashflows.
Income taxes In determining the Groups provisions for income tax and deferred tax it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.
Financial statements 61 Meggitt PLC Report and accounts 2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS CONTINUED Environmental matters The Group is involved in the investigation and remediation of certain sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under US law.
Advice is received by the Group from its environmental consultants and legal advisors to assist in the determination of the timing and estimation of the costs that the Group may incur in respect of such claims and an appropriate provision is made.
To the extent that these estimates change as more information becomes available adjustments are made to the carrying value of the provision.
The Group has extensive insurance arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of historical environmental events on the Group.
Legal and regulatory The Group is subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
The Group is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.
A determination of the amount of reserves required for these matters is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel.
However, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates.
Retirement benefit obligations The liability recognised in respect of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to mortality, inflation, salary increases, healthcare cost increases and the rate at which liabilities are discounted.
Any change in these assumptions would impact the retirement benefit obligations recognised.
Further details on these estimates are provided in note 35.

IFRS 3 requires finished goods acquired through a business combination to be valued at estimated selling price less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort.
Work in progress acquired in a business combination is valued at estimated selling price less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the work not yet completed.
The fair value of acquired inventory is thus significantly higher than the same items built post acquisition, the value of which includes no profit element.
This increase arising from the revalued inventory is charged to the income statement as the inventory is consumed and is excluded from the Groups underlying profit figures.
c. Although the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures, it has decided that the costs of meeting the extensive documentation required to be able to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are not merited.
The Groups underlying profit figures exclude amounts which would not have been recorded if hedge accounting had been applied.
Where interest rate derivatives do not qualify to be hedge accounted, movements in the fair value of those derivatives are excluded from underlying profit.
Where interest rate derivatives do qualify to be accounted for as fair value hedges, any difference between the movement in the fair values of the derivatives and in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is excluded from underlying profit.
Any gains or losses arising from the requirement to continue to measure fixed rate borrowings at fair value after the associated interest rate derivatives have matured or have been cancelled are also excluded from underlying profit.

The goodwill adjustment arises from the recognition of tax losses during the year in respect of businesses acquired in earlier years.
These tax losses existed when the businesses were acquired but a deferred tax asset was not recognised at the time as the recoverability of those losses was not probable at the time the fair values were finalised.
IFRS requires that goodwill is adjusted in the year the recoverability becomes probable with a corresponding charge recorded in profit before tax see note 14.

Costs incurred during the year include the rationalisation of repair and overhaul centres with the relocation of the Slough and Liege facilities to Coventry in the UK and the relocation of the Atlanta facility to Akron in the US.
Costs were also incurred in rationalising and restructuring R&D and engineering capabilities and in moving steel brake and structural manufacturing from Akron to Mexico.
Further exceptional operating costs of 14.1m are expected to arise over the next two years as the integration is completed.
During the year the relocation of Caswell and FATS US to a new site in Atlanta was completed.
c. During the year other business integration costs were also incurred, principally the integration of the Avery Hardoll business into other businesses in the Group.
Cash expenditure on all exceptional operating costs above was 16.5 million 2007: 4.2 million, including 9.5 million in respect of K&F 2007: 1.9 million and 3.3 million 2007: 1.3 million in respect of FATS.

In January 2008 the Group completed the disposal of S-Tec Corporation and recorded a profit of 1.9 million which has been treated as an exceptional operating item.
e. The Group announced on 6 March 2007 the proposed acquisition of K&F for an enterprise value of USD 1.8 billion funded in part by a rights issue with the balance financed by a new debt facility.
The reduction in net finance costs arising from the cash raised by the rights issue and finance costs associated with the new debt facilities was treated as exceptional net finance income in respect of the period between the completion of the rights issue on 18 April 2007 and the completion of the acquisition on 22 June 2007. f. Following the acquisition of K&F, the Group commenced a cash tender offer for K&Fs USD 315 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior subordinated notes which were due in 2014.
This tender offer successfully completed on 3 August 2007.
The premium payable on redemption, being the difference between the total consideration paid and the book value of the notes at the date the offer completed, was treated as exceptional finance costs.

15 PROFIT OF PARENT COMPANY The profit attributable to the shareholders of Meggitt PLC includes a profit, after dividends received, of 104.6 million 2007: 40.8 million which has been dealt with in the accounts of that Company.
Meggitt PLC, which prepares its accounts in accordance with UK GAAP, has taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 allowing it not to publish a separate profit and loss account.
16 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Earnings per ordinary share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The weighted average number of shares used excludes any shares bought by the Group and held as own shares see note 39.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share adjusts the weighted average number of shares to reflect the assumption that all potentially dilutive ordinary shares convert.
For the Group this means assuming all share options in issue are exercised.

No impairment charge was required in the year 2007: Nil and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date is Nil 2007: Nil.
For the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs which principally comprise its individual business operations.
The allocation of goodwill to CGUs is initially carried out in the year a business is acquired according to those CGUs which are expected to benefit from the acquisition.
Subsequent adjustments are made to this allocation to the extent that operations to which goodwill relates are transferred between CGUs or disposed of outside the Group.
An analysis of goodwill by principal CGU is shown below: 2008 2007 Restated m m Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems MABS 749.6 575.1 Whittaker Controls Inc 183.3 132.4 Engineering Fabrics Corporation EFC 79.0 57.4 Meggitt Training Systems Inc 72.5 52.4 Other 298.3 250.5 Total 1,382.7 1,067.8 For each CGU the Group has determined its recoverable amount from value in use calculations.
The value in use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and plans approved by management in December 2008 for the next three years.
Cash flows for periods beyond three years are extrapolated using estimated growth rates.
The resultant cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate for the relevant CGU.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are shown below: Sales volumes, selling prices and cost increases over the five years covered by managements detailed plans.
Sales volumes are based on industry forecasts and or management estimates for the businesses in which each CGU operates including forecasts for OEM deliveries of large jets, regional aircraft and business jets: air traffic growth and military spending by the US DOD and other major governments.
Sales prices and cost increases are based on past experience and management expectations of future changes in the market.
A cautious approach to volume levels, selling prices and cost increases has been taken given the current global economic uncertainty.
The extent to which these assumptions affect each CGU with a significant level of goodwill are described below.
MABS and Whittaker Controls Inc are broadly spread across both civil aerospace and military platforms with Whittaker Controls Inc also operating in the energy sector.
Within the civil aerospace sector MABS is a world leader in the supply of brake systems for regional aircraft and business jets, whilst the Whittaker Controls business, which designs and manufactures fluid control devices and systems, has a higher content on large jets.
Both businesses have significant OEM and aftermarket revenues with the latter representing the greater proportion of revenues.
In civil aerospace external forecasts suggest air traffic, measured in available seat kilometres ASKs, will decline by 3% to 5% in 2009 and remain flat or increase slightly in 2010.
This will translate into reduced use of existing aircraft and, combined with adverse conditions in credit markets, lower sales of new aircraft.
Sales and usage of business jets will also see the declines.
In military markets, the US DoD base budget is predicted to grow by around 3% in 2009 and, with market share gains, the Groups energy business are also forecast to grow: these markets are forecast to remain robust over the coming years.
EFC and Meggitt Training Systems Inc both operate in the military sectors.
The principal customer of EFC is the US DOD to whom EFC are a leading supplier of flexible fuel tanks.
Meggitt Training Systems Inc supplies integrated live and virtual training packages for armed forces and law enforcement agencies across the world.
The forecasts used for military markets are as outlined above: Growth rates used for periods beyond those covered by managements detailed budgets and plans.
Growth rates are derived based on managements estimates which take into account the long-term nature of the industry in which each CGU operates, external industry forecasts of long-term growth in the aerospace and defence sectors, the extent to which a CGU has sole source position on platforms where it is able to share in a continuing stream of highly profitable aftermarket revenues, the maturity of the platforms supplied by the CGU and the technological content of the CGUs products.
For the purpose of impairment testing a conservative approach has been used and where the derived rate is higher than the long-term GDP growth rates for the countries in which the CGU operates UK: 2.4%, US: 2.9%, the latter has been used: and Discount rates applied to future cash flows.
The Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC was used as the foundation for determining the discount rates to be applied.
The Group WACC was then adjusted to reflect risks specific to the CGU that are not already reflected in the future cash flows for that CGU.
The discount rates used were as follows: MABS 11.8%, Whittaker Controls Inc, 12.0%, EFC 12.3%, and Meggitt Training Systems Inc 12.6%.
The Group has carried out a sensitivity analysis on the impairment testing on the CGUs carrying values.
In performing the sensitivity analysis the Group has considered the potential impacts of the current economic uncertainty affecting the civil aerospace markets in particular.
The Group has examined the effects of other past shock events on air traffic growth both in the short term and the medium long term.
These included the effects of the 1973 and 1979 oil crises, the first Gulf War in 1991 and impact of 9 11, SARS and the second Gulf War in 2001.
Past experience has shown that these events only had a short term negative impact on air traffic growth.
Accordingly, and given the sole source position that both MABS and Whittaker Controls Inc have on civil platforms with lives of up to thirty years and the exposure to military markets, with typically larger platform lives, that all four CGUs have, management has concluded that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.

31 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS For cash, receivables and short-term borrowings the fair value of the financial instruments approximates to their book value due to the short maturity periods of these financial instruments.
On receivables, allowances are made within the book value for credit risk.
For other borrowings and financial liabilities, the fair value is based on market values or, where not available, on discounting future cash flows at prevailing market rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
Market rates have been used to determine the fair values of the interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.

Meggitts operations and facilities are subject to laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants and hazardous substances into the ground, air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of such materials and other environmental matters.
Failure to comply with its obligations potentially exposes the Group to serious consequences, including fines, other sanctions and limitations on operations.
The Group is involved in the investigation and remediation of current and former sites for which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under US law.
Provision has been made for the expected costs arising from these sites based on information currently available and a receivable established to the extent these costs are recoverable under the Groups environmental insurance policies.
A number of asbestos-related claims have been made against subsidiary companies of the Group.
To date, the amount connected with such claims in any year has not been material and many claims are covered fully or partly by existing insurance and indemnities.
There is a provision for claims which cannot be recovered from insurers.
In 2000, the US Government started to investigate alleged violations of US export control laws by a US subsidiary of the Group and is also investigating alleged breaches by three other subsidiaries, one of which is in the UK.
These investigations are likely to lead to financial penalties for which provision has been made.
The provisions are expected to be mainly utilised over the next ten years and are discounted, where appropriate, using a discount rate relevant to each provision.
b Onerous contracts include lease obligations and trading contracts.
Provision has been set up for the estimated rental shortfall in respect of properties with onerous lease obligations and will be utilised over the lease terms typically up to ten years and are discounted using a discount rate appropriate to each provision.
Provision has also been set up for the estimated losses to be made under certain trading contracts.
These are expected to be utilised over the next five years.

The balances after allowing for such offsets are as follows: 2008 2007 Restated m m Deferred tax assets 112.4 41.4 Deferred tax liabilities 359.9 265.5 Net balance at 31 December 247.5 224.1 Deferred tax assets are analysed as follows: 2008 2007 m m To be recovered within 12 months 10.1 23.0 To be recovered after more than 12 months 102.3 18.4 Total 112.4 41.4 Deferred tax liabilities are analysed as follows: 2008 2007 Restated m m To be recovered within 12 months 25.9 22.7 To be recovered after more than 12 months 334.0 242.8 Total 359.9 265.5 The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 11.8 million 2007: 7.5 million.
The majority relate to the Groups operations in the USA and unutilised losses.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items, as it is not regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets not recognised would be recoverable in the event that they reverse and suitable taxable profits are available.
No provision has been made for taxation that would arise in the event of foreign subsidiaries distributing their reserves as these amounts are retained for investment in the businesses.
The aggregate unrecognised deferred tax liability in respect of such unremitted earnings is 36.0 million 2007: 21.0 million.
35 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Pension schemes In the UK, the Group operates three defined benefit schemes all of which are closed to new members.
In the USA, the Group operates five defined benefit schemes, two of which are closed to new members.
The US schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans.
In Switzerland the Group operates a defined benefit scheme which is a funded scheme.
The assets of all of the defined benefit schemes are held in trust funds separate from the Groups finances.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes.
Healthcare schemes The Group has two principal other post-retirement benefit schemes providing medical and life assurance benefits, both of which arose on the acquisition of K&F.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

In determining pension liabilities the Group uses mortality assumptions which are based on published mortality tables adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the scheme populations.
The Groups mortality assumptions are based on the PA92 medium cohort year of birth mortality tables for the UK schemes and the RP2000 IRS RPA tables for the US schemes.
The life expectancies reflected in the mortality assumptions used are as follows: 2008 2007 UK Overseas UK Overseas schemes schemes schemes schemes years years years years Member age 45 life expectancy at age 65 male 21.2-22.8 19.2 21.2-22.8 19.2 Member age 45 life expectancy at age 65 female 24.0-25.6 21.1 24.0-25.6 21.1 Member age 65 current life expectancy male 20.1-21.5 18.8 20.1-21.5 18.8 Member age 65 current life expectancy female 23.0-24.4 20.8 23.0-24.4 20.8 Details on the sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in discount rates and inflation rates are provided below: The impact of a 10 basis point reduction in discount rate would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2008 to increase by approximately 9.8 million: The impact of a 10 basis point reduction in inflation rate would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2008 to reduce by approximately 5.4 million: The impact of a 10 basis point increase in medical trend rates would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2008 to increase by approximately 0.3 million: The impact of assuming every scheme member were to live for an additional year would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2008 to increase by approximately 14.3 million.

Performance was measured by comparing the Total Shareholder Return TSR achieved by Meggitt with that of other companies in a comparator group chosen by the Remuneration Committee.
The Meggitt Equity Participation Scheme was replaced during 2005 by the Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005.
Under the Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005 an annual award of shares may be made to certain senior executives.
The number of shares if any, that an executive will ultimately receive, will depend on the Groups performance during a three year period commencing at the beginning of the financial year in which the award is made the measurement period.
Performance is measured by comparing the Total Shareholder Return TSR achieved by the Group with that of other companies in a comparator group chosen by the Remuneration Committee.
Changes to the performance condition were made for the 2008 award.
In line with what is now common market practice, 50% of the awards vesting will be based on TSR performance, and 50% on an earnings per share condition.
An expense of 2.4 million 2007: 1.9 million was recorded in the year.

At 31 December 2007 the Group had allocated provisional fair values to the net assets acquired as a result of this acquisition.
The Group finalised these fair values in 2008.
In accordance with IFRS 3 these amendments have been recorded as though they were made in 2007.
The impact on net assets and the income statement arising from the finalisation of fair values is shown in note 46.
