Notes to the Accounts 1 Statement of significant accounting policies a Statement of compliance The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985. b Basis of preparation of financial statements The Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Group will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Groups cash flow forecasts show that it has adequate resources available to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
In preparing these forecasts the Directors have taken into account the following matters that give rise to a material uncertainty: the potential breaches of various financing covenants if there are continued reductions in property valuations the successful completion of one or more of the options being pursued to provide additional financial flexibility including disposals of assets, debt renegotiations and an equity raising.
Having taken into account the above matters, the Directors have concluded, based on the cash flow forecasts, that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Further details on the above uncertainty and the options being pursued are included in the Chairmans Statement on pages 4 and 5, the Chief Executives Review on pages 6 and 7 and the Financial Review on pages 26 to 29.
The financial statements are presented in sterling and amounts are disclosed rounded to the nearest 100,000, unless otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all periods presented in these financial statements, except as stated below.
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 40 Investment Property.
Development properties previously accounted for under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, are now classified as investment properties in the course of construction under IAS 40.
This has no impact on the equity or results for the current and previous year.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of these financial statements are reasonable.
However, actual outcomes may differ from those anticipated.
c Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the results of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December each year.
Control is assumed where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.
d Investment in joint ventures Joint ventures are those entities over which the Group exerts joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The Group accounts for its investments in its jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting.
Under this method the investment is initially recorded at cost and is subsequently adjusted to reflect the Groups share of the net profit or loss of the joint venture.
The Groups share of joint venture results is included in a single line item in the income statement.
e Goodwill On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill is carried in the balance sheet at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The balance is reviewed for impairment at least annually with impairment being recognised immediately in the income statement.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
On disposal of a subsidiary or a property disposal, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
f Investment properties and investment properties in the course of construction Investment properties are properties owned or leased under finance leases by the Group which are held either for long term rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost including related transaction costs and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
The basis of valuation of properties is described in note 12.
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, investment property held under a finance lease is stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the income statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Additions to investment properties consist of costs of a capital nature and, in the case of investment properties in the course of construction, capitalised interest, certain internal staff and associated costs directly attributable to the management of the investment properties under construction.
uk 1 Statement of significant accounting policies continued When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property remains an investment property measured at fair value through the income statement.
Borrowing costs associated with direct expenditure on investment properties in the course of construction and investment properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised using the Groups weighted average cost of the relevant borrowings.
Interest is capitalised from the commencement of the development work until the date when the property is physically complete and becomes available for occupation.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of an investment property in the course of construction are capitalised.
When investment properties in the course of construction are completed, they are reclassified as investment properties.
g Plant and equipment Plant and equipment comprise computers, motor vehicles, furniture, fixtures and fittings and improvements to Group offices.
These assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives are computers three years: motor vehicles four years: furniture 10 years: fixtures and fittings 10 years and improvements to Group offices 10 years.
h Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and written down accordingly.
i Leases Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction.
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as a lessee In accordance with IAS 40, leases of investment property are assessed on a property by property basis.
The Groups investment properties are accounted for as finance leases and are recognised as an asset and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments.
The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet at fair value, gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Lease payments, where material, are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate.
Other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Group as lessor Assets leased out under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the net investment in the leases.
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant rate of return on net investment.
A description of the Group, as a lessor, with respect to leasing arrangements is included in the Business Review on pages 8 to 25.
Assets leased out under operating leases are included in investment property, with rental income recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Benefits granted as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
j Financial instruments Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised at invoiced value, if that is not materially different from fair value, less provisions for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the agreed terms of the receivables concerned.
Cash and short term deposits Cash and short term deposits comprise cash on hand, deposits with banks, other short term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, net of bank overdrafts.
Interest bearing borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and are recognised at invoiced amount.
Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps in order to manage the risks arising from its activities as described in more detail in the Risk Management section on page 30, the Financial Review on pages 26 to 29 and in note 19.
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are remeasured to fair value as calculated by the counterparties based on market prices at subsequent balance sheet dates.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments and hence any change in the fair value of such derivatives is recognised immediately in the income statement as a finance cost.
k Pension costs The obligations of defined benefit pension schemes, representing benefits accruing to employees, are measured at discounted present value while scheme assets are measured at their fair value.
The discount rate used is the yield on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the working lives of the employees concerned and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from either experience differing from previous actuarial assumptions or changes to those assumptions are recognised in full in the year in which they occur immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are expensed as incurred.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 51 Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Statement of significant accounting policies continued l Revenue recognition Revenue comprises rental income of the Groups investment properties.
Service charges and other recoveries from tenants are netted off against property outgoings.
Rental income from investment property leased out under an operating lease is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and are therefore also recognised on the same, straight-line basis.
Surrender premiums received in the period from tenants vacating the property before the end of the lease are included in rental income.
A property is regarded as sold when the significant risks and returns have been transferred to the buyer, which is normally on unconditional exchange of contracts.
For conditional exchanges, sales are recognised when the conditions are satisfied.
m Share and share based remuneration The cost of equity settled transactions with employees and Directors is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised in the income statement as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the individuals concerned become fully entitled to the award.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
The charge is reversed if it appears likely that the performance criteria will not be met.
The fair value of share options awarded has been calculated, based on advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street, using a stochastic option valuation model.
n Income tax The charge for current UK corporation tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences, except in respect of investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
o Exceptional items Non-recurring expenses and gains recognised outside the normal course of business are classified as exceptional and are identified separately in the financial statements.
p New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations which may be relevant to the Group with an effective date after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS IFRS 2 Amendment to IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations 1 January 2009 IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations 1 July 2009 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 IAS 1 revised Presentation of Financial Statements 1 January 2009 IAS 27 revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 1 July 2009 IAS 32 & IAS 1 Amendment Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation 1 January 2009 Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards 1 January 2009 IFRIC IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate 1 January 2009 IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners 1 July 2009 These pronouncements, when applied, will either result in changes to presentation and disclosure, or are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.

The sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: i the balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative financial instruments as debt and deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: ii the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: 0.5% 0.5% decrease in increase in interest rates interest rates m m At 31 December 2008 Decrease increase in fair value of financial instruments 54.6 42.3 Impact on net interest payable gain loss 0.5 0.6 Total impact on net income and net assets 54.1 41.7 At 31 December 2007 Decrease increase in fair value of financial instruments 7.0 4.8 Impact on net interest payable gain loss 1.5 1.5 Total impact on net income and net assets 5.5 3.3 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 59 Notes to the Accounts continued 20 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 Book Fair Fair value Book Fair Fair value value value adjustment value value adjustment m m m m m m Financial assets Cash and short term deposits 13.8 13.8 6.3 6.3 Trade and other receivables 29.1 29.1 26.5 26.5 Total financial assets 42.9 42.9 32.8 32.8 Financial liabilities 6% Bonds 2010 274.6 256.9 17.7 274.4 277.8 3.4 5.25% Bonds 2015 144.4 103.6 40.8 149.3 140.8 8.5 6% Bonds 2019 209.7 136.0 73.7 209.7 201.3 8.4 Sterling bank loans and overdrafts 247.3 247.3 177.0 177.0 876.0 743.8 132.2 810.4 796.9 13.5 Interest rate derivatives 173.2 173.2 34.9 34.9 Trade and other payables 43.1 43.1 48.1 48.1 Total financial liabilities 1,092.3 960.1 132.2 893.4 879.9 13.5 Total net financial liabilities 1,049.4 917.2 132.2 860.6 847.1 13.5 Fair value on a post tax basis 132.2 13.5 Fair values have been calculated by using market values at the balance sheet date.
The market values of derivatives and borrowings have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of short term deposits is assumed to approximate to their book values.
The Groups only obligation is to pay interest and repay its bonds and loans at par value on the maturity dates.
Sterling loans of 92.8m 2007: 92.3m have been made by Group companies to joint ventures.
These loans are not interest bearing and the return is dependent on the overall return from the partnerships.
The fair value of these loans is assumed to be their book values.

Assets of the pension scheme are held separately from those of Group companies, being invested with insurance companies.
Contributions payable to this scheme by the Group, at rates specified in the rules of the scheme, totalled 0.4m 2007: 0.3m.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates two funded defined benefit pension schemes.
The main scheme, the Brixton Scheme, is non-contributory for members and provides benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Contributions, payable by the Company, were invested in funds managed by Legal & General Investment Management Limited.
The scheme was effectively closed to new entrants on 1 January 1998.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of scheme assets and of the present value of the defined benefit obligation for the Brixton Scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2006 by a qualified actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the attained age method.
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme, the Industrious Scheme, in respect of employees who transferred with the Industrious Group in 2005.
This scheme provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and was closed to new entrants on 2 July 1999.
Contributions are invested in funds managed by Legal & General Investment Management Limited.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of scheme assets and of the present value of the defined benefit obligation for the Industrious Scheme was carried out as at 1 July 2007 by a qualified actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The valuations for both schemes have been updated using the projected unit credit method to 31 December 2008 by a qualified independent actuary.
