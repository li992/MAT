The hedged forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next two years.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity note 16 on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 December 2008 are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
Financial instruments Financial risk and treasury policies The treasury department maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Groups bankers, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk and provides a treasury service to the Groups businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The Group treasury department is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged by the use of forward exchange contracts.
i CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and monies on deposit with financial institutions.
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced through the use of credit insurance covering 60%-75% of trade receivables at any time.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set above this depending on the value of the sale.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of non-insured receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
