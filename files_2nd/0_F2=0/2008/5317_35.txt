22 Deferred tax assets and liabilities Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: Assets Liabilities Net Restated Restated 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Group m m m m m m Property, plant & equipment 0.4 0.1 12.7 13.5 12.3 13.4 Goodwill 22.3 18.3 22.3 18.3 Retirement benefit obligations 6.1 9.6 6.1 9.6 Inventories 0.2 0.4 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 Employee benefits 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 Provisions 1.3 1.0 1.3 1.0 Other items 5.8 2.4 0.6 0.8 5.2 1.6 Tax losses 10.8 11.1 10.8 11.1 Tax assets liabilities 26.0 26.1 35.7 32.7 9.7 6.6 Set off of tax 11.3 9.8 11.3 9.8 Net tax assets liabilities 14.7 16.3 24.4 22.9 9.7 6.6 A deferred tax asset has been recognised for tax losses where current projections show that sufficient taxable profits will arise in the near future against which these losses may be offset.
2008 2007 m m Unrecognised deferred tax assets Tax losses 14.0 8.5 14.0 8.5 The tax losses above have not been recognised as recoverability is uncertain.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was expected to be 5.9m 2007: 6.0m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Further, the Group has sufficient relevant losses to fully offset the 5.9m liability.
Deferred tax is provided at the standard rate of corporation tax applicable at the balance sheet date unless there is legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date changing the rate.
In the UK, the standard rate of corporation tax for the year ended 31 March 2008 is 30%.
However, the UK tax rate applicable when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled is 28%.
The effect of the change in rate in the UK on the net deferred tax liability is 0.1m.
