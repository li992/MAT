Scottish and Southern Energy Annual Report 2008 05 Notes on the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2008 continued 68 1.
Segmental Information Accounting policies continued Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Decommissioning costs The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the useful lives of certain assets is reviewed periodically.
Provision is made for the estimated cost of decommissioning.
Decommissioning dates are uncertain but are expected to be between 2008 and 2035.
A corresponding decommissioning asset is recognised and is included within property, plant and equipment.
Changes in these provisions are recognised prospectively.
The unwinding of the discount on the provision is included in finance costs and the depreciation of the asset is straight-line over the expected useful life of the asset.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact to the financial statements.
The most critical of these accounting judgement and estimation areas are noted.
i Revenue recognition Revenue on energy sales includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end.
This will have been estimated by using historical consumption patterns and takes into consideration industry reconciliation processes for total consumption by supplier.
At the balance sheet date, the estimated consumption by customers will either have been billed estimated billed revenue or accrued unbilled revenue.
Management apply judgement to the measurement of the quantum of the estimated consumption and to the valuation of that consumption.
The judgements applied, and the assumptions underpinning these judgements are considered to be appropriate.
However, a change in these assumptions would impact upon the amount of revenue recognised.
ii Retirement benefits The assumptions in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement benefits during the period are set after consultation with qualified actuaries.
While these assumptions are believed to be appropriate, a change in these assumptions would impact the earnings of the Group.
The value of scheme assets is impacted by the asset ceiling test which restricts the surplus that can be recognised to assets that can be recovered fully through refunds or reductions in future contributions.
iii Impairment testing The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that the value of those assets is impaired.
In assessing for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash flows are allocated to an appropriate cash generating unit CGU.
The recoverable amount of the assets, or the appropriate CGU, is measured as the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Management necessarily apply judgement in allocating assets that do not generate independent cash flows to appropriate CGUs.
The value in use calculation also requires estimation of the timing and value of underlying projected cash flows.
Subsequent changes to these estimates or judgements may impact the carrying value of the assets within the respective CGUs.
iv Provisions and contingencies The assessments undertaken in recognising provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with IAS 37.
The evaluation of the likelihood of the contingent events has required best judgement by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential loss.
Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.
v Financial instruments fair values The valuation of the financial instruments reported in note 28 is based upon published price quotations in active markets and valuation techniques where such information is not available.
Energy commodity contracts are classified as either derivative contracts under IAS 39 or as contracts for the Groups own use requirements.
Only IAS 39 derivatives are accounted for on a fair value basis.
More detail on this is included in note 28. vi Exceptional and re-measurements The criteria for identifying what constitutes an exceptional item are outlined in note 1 Use of estimates and judgements.
SEGMENTAL INFORMATION Primary reporting format business segments The primary segments are as reported for management purposes and reflect the day-to-day management of the business.
The Groups primary segments are the distribution and transmission of electricity in the North of Scotland, the distribution of electricity in the South of England together referred to as Power Systems and the generation and supply of electricity and sale of gas in Great Britain and Ireland Generation and Supply.
The Groups 50% equity share in Scotia Gas Networks plc, a business which distributes gas in Scotland and the South of England is included as a separate business segment where appropriate due to its significance.
Analysis of revenue, operating profit, assets, liabilities and other items by segment is provided overleaf.
All revenue and profit before taxation arise from operations within Great Britain and Ireland.
