Derivatives and financial instruments Currency derivatives The Group uses derivative instruments in order to manage foreign currency exchange risk arising on expected future purchases of internationally sourced products in the Groups subsidiaries.
In all cases the implementation of these derivative instruments has been negotiated to match expected purchases and they therefore qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of cash flow hedges in place at 26 April 2008 is 0.4 m 2007: nil, which has been recognised in the hedging reserve.
Interest rate hedging Based on its current debt levels, the Group moves to a net cash position during its third quarter and therefore interest rate exposure is limited.
Consequently, no interest rate hedging instruments have been utilised.
Interest rate exposures continue to be monitored in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.
Hedge of net investments in foreign entities The Group has Canadian dollar denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in Canada.
At 26 April 2008 the carrying amount of the borrowings was nil 2007: 4.5m.
