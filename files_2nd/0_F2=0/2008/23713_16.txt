Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Segment reporting Until 3 September 2008, the Group operated as a single asset management business, which did not comprise different business segments, and the Board viewed the business as a whole as the primary reportable entity.
Following the acquisition of the REIT Property Asset Management Group REIT Group on 3 September 2008 and the transfer of existing property asset management activities ino the new entity, F&C REIT, the Board considers F&C REIT to be a separate business segment.
F&C REIT has a separate Board of Directors with considerable autonomy, and operationally, F&C REIT is managed separately from the rest of the F&C Group.
The internal financial reporting which takes place within the Group reflects this revised organisational and management structure.
Therefore, the primary reporting format is by business segment, with the Group now comprising the following two business segments: Investment Management: and Property Asset Management.
While there are different sources of revenue within the Investment Management business segment and distinct distribution channels, and assets under management can be categorised by client type and asset class, the Directors do not consider these to constitute separate business segments within the meaning of IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
The organisational structure, internal financial reporting and performance monitoring is not further segregated below this level.
In previous accounting periods, prior to the acquisition of the REIT Group, the Group reported segment information on a geographical basis by location of assets, and in the absence of business segments, disclosed the geographical segments as the primary reporting format.
By default, primary segment disclosures were reported for what was the Groups single business segment asset management in the consolidated column of the primary segment table.
The change in segment reporting during 2008 has not arisen due to a change in accounting policy but rather, from the aforementioned business combination and it is the inherent corporate development which has driven the reporting changes: the reporting changes are necessary to ensure continued compliance with IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
As such, prior period disclosures cannot be restated as the underlying information, and indeed the corporate circumstances, did not exist prior to the acquisition.
Further, because geographical segments were previously given as the primary format reporting only because the Board considered the business as a whole to be the primary reportable segment, segment data for the old basis of segmentation has not been reported for the current period.
Therefore, the numerical analyses which follow have been given first for 2008, followed by those for 2007, as they were reported last year.
For 2008, secondary format disclosures are given on a geographical basis: segment revenue is based on geographical location of customers, whilst segment assets and capital expenditure are split by geographical location of assets.
The Group has identified three geographical areas: The United Kingdom Continental Europe : and Rest of the World.
Continental Europe is defined as being within the European Economic Area.
These areas present different risks to the Group, primarily of a legislative and regulatory nature.
The Group has physical operations and statutory entities registered in each of these areas.
Transfer prices between reportable segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment result include transfers between reportable segments.
Those transfers are eliminated on consolidation.

Expenses contd The Groups policy on the award of non-audit services to accountancy firms is outlined in the Directors Report on Corporate Governance.
During the year the fees paid by F&C to other accountancy firms for non-audit services were as follows: 2008 2007 m m Ernst & Young 0.6 0.3  0.5 0.5 Deloitte & Touche 0.2 0.2 1.3 1.0 During 2008, in addition to the above, 0.8m 2007: nil was paid to Deloitte & Touche for services relating to acquisitions.
These fees have been capitalised and are included within expenses of acquisition see note 16.
In addition to the above, the following fees were paid by OEICs and unit trusts, for which Group companies are the Authorised Corporate Director or Manager, for services provided directly to them: 2008 2007 m m  0.4 0.3 5.
Employee benefits expenses Total employee benefits expenses, including remuneration of the Directors, were: 2008 2007 Notes m m Short-term employee benefits: Salaries and related benefits 58.6 53.6 Bonus 18.6 26.7 Wages and salaries 77.2 80.3 Social Security costs 7.9 10.6 85.1 90.9 Post-employment benefits: Defined contributions scheme expenses 27 4.5 4.4 Defined benefits scheme expenses 27 3.5 4.6 8.0 9.0 Total of wages and salaries, Social Security costs and post-employment benefits 93.1 99.9 Termination benefits 4.6 2.3 Share-based payment expenses 28 14.3 16.4 Total employee benefits expenses 112.0 118.6 The monthly average number of employees including Executive Directors of the Group during 2008 was 1,052 2007: 901.
F&C Asset Management plc had no employees during either year.
The above table includes 4.8m 2007: nil of exceptional employment costs, as disclosed in note 6 b.
Exceptional costs a Unrealised losses on forward currency contracts 2008 2007 m m Unrealised losses on forward currency contracts 12.3 During 2008, the Group entered into a series of forward currency contracts to provide certainty to the Sterling value of a portion of the Groups Euro denominated cash flows.
In line with accounting requirements, open contracts are carried in the Balance Sheet at their fair value.
At 31 December 2008 an unrealised loss of 12.3m was recognised.
These unrealised forward contracts were established to protect future Sterling values: the unrealised loss has been excluded from the calculation of underlying earnings.
Realised gains or losses on such contracts are included in determining underlying earnings.
b Other exceptional operating costs The Group has classified the following operating costs as exceptional: 2008 2007 m m Corporate advisory fees i 4.4 Exceptional employment costs ii 4.8 F&C REIT variable minority interest SBP expense iii 1.4 Investment Trust VAT expense iv 4.2 Re-Investment Plan costs v 6.4 10.6 10.6 i Corporate advisory fees 2008 2007 m m Corporate advisory fees 4.4 During 2008, Friends Provident announced its intention to divest of its 52 per cent.
The F&C Board subsequently appointed legal, commercial and corporate finance advisors to assist in identifying a solution which would meet the needs of both F&C and Friends Provident.
A total of 4.4m of corporate advisory fees and related costs were incurred during the year.
The Directors consider these corporate costs to be exceptional in nature and have therefore excluded this expense from the measurement of underlying earnings.
ii Exceptional employment costs 2008 2007 m m Exceptional employment costs 4.8 As a result of the challenging and volatile market conditions experienced in 2008 and the adverse consequential impact on the Groups revenues, management has identified and initiated actions to achieve annualised cost savings.
The annualised benefit of the savings is expected to be substantially realised during 2009 with the full benefit arising in 2010.
Management has sought to avoid any cost saving initiative which would significantly impede the Groups distribution capabilities which are the key focus for business growth.
The Directors consider the one-off redundancy and related costs of achieving these savings to be exceptional in nature and have therefore excluded the employment costs of 4.8m incurred in achieving the annualised cost savings from the measurement of underlying earnings.

Exceptional costs contd iii F&C REIT variable minority interest share-based payment SBP expense 2008 2007 m m F&C REIT variable minority interest SBP expense 1.4 Details of the acquisition of the REIT Property Asset Management Group during 2008 are given in note 16 a.
As a result of this transaction, F&C controls 70 per cent.
of the merged property business F&C REIT and the former owners of REIT, two of whom occupy key management roles within F&C REIT, hold a 30 per cent.
The former owners have the opportunity to increase their ownership by a further 10 per cent.
through the achievement of certain performance targets over the next six years.
This earn-out mechanism meets the criteria of a share-based payment and results in a charge of 1.4m to the Income Statement in 2008.
This expense has been excluded from underlying earnings as it is considered to be capital in nature, which is consistent with the treatment of share scheme costs associated with previous acquisitions.
Full details of this arrangement are given in note 28 viii.
iv Investment Trust VAT expense 2008 2007 m m Investment Trust VAT expense 4.2 During 2007, following the outcome of litigation, HMRC concluded that investment management fees paid by investment trusts were not subject to VAT.
This expense represents VAT and interest which may be payable to investment trust clients in respect of historic periods, beyond the amounts recoverable from HMRC.
Due to the non-recurring nature of this expense the Directors have excluded this from underlying earnings.
Details relating to the uncertainties in respect of this expense and the associated provision are given in note 26. v Re-Investment Plan costs 2008 2007 m m Re-Investment Plan costs 6.4 The Re-Investment Plan share-based payment arrangement was established in 2004 to act as a lock-in and incentivisation for former employees of F&C Group Holdings, which was acquired at that time.
The final transfer of shares vesting under this scheme occurred in 2007 and the charge of 6.4m represents the final costs associated with this scheme.
Details of this scheme are given in note 28 iii.

Earnings per Share Basic loss earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the loss earnings for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted loss earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the loss earnings for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary Shares into Ordinary Shares.
In the opinion of the Directors the underlying earnings, quantified as in the Earnings table below, more accurately reflects the underlying earnings performance of the Group.

As a result, the reported basic and diluted loss per Ordinary Share are the same in 2008.
The following reflects the earnings and share capital data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations: 2008 2007 Earnings m m Loss earnings attributable to Ordinary equity holders of the parent for basic loss earnings per share 52.4 17.1 Amortisation of intangibles, net of tax 34.2 25.4 Impairment of intangibles, net of tax 34.5 Corporate advisory fees, net of tax 4.3 Exceptional employment costs, net of tax 3.4 F&C REIT variable minority interest SBP expense, net of tax 1.4 Loss on partial disposal of property business, net of tax 4.1 Unrealised losses on forward currency contracts, net of tax 8.8 Investment Trust VAT expense, net of tax 2.9 Cost of the Re-Investment Plan, net of tax 4.8 Underlying earnings attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent 38.3 50.2 excludes 0.7m 2007: nil of amortisation of intangibles net of tax which is attributable to minority interests.

Where the option prices are below the average share price for the year, these options have been treated as dilutive.
The F&C REIT variable minority interest SBP, details of which are disclosed in note 28 viii gives the F&C REIT minority partners the opportunity to increase their holdings from 30% to 40% before 31 December 2014.
This would potentially dilute the profits attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
The potential effect of the dilution on the profits for the year are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Losses profits attributable to equity holders of the parent 52.4 17.1 Dilution of profits through increase in F&C REIT minority interest 0.3 Losses profits attributable to equity holders of the parent after dilution 52.7 17.1 However, the principle of the incentive is that the incremental profits which would become attributable to minority interests as a result of achieving the performance criteria are funded from the increased level of absolute profits generated by F&C REIT for the year in which vesting arises, rather than diluting the current level of profits attributable to equity holders of the parent.
There can be no guarantee that subsequent to vesting that the higher level of profits which met the vesting criteria would necessarily be sustainable.
417,586 share awards 2007: nil vested, in respect of good leavers in the period between the reporting date and the approval of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
These have been satisfied by the issue of Ordinary Share capital.
Potential future dilution The Group operates several share-based payment schemes which could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future but which were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they were anti-dilutive for the years presented.
The share-based payment schemes with relevant performance criteria must meet such criteria for each scheme before the exercise of options is possible.
The only exception to this is for good leavers, where there is usually a period of time over which the employees can exercise their options in accordance with the specific rules of each scheme regardless of whether the performance criteria have been met.
The options granted under the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme vested on 24 March 2006, as the performance criteria had been met.
At 31 December 2008 the 884,182 31 December 2007: 1,333,047 options outstanding, at exercise prices between 203.83p and 455.83p, are now potentially dilutive, as settlement would be made by the issue of new shares.
All options granted under the 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme vested on 24 March 2006, as the performance criteria had been met.
The 1,082,028 31 December 2007: 1,228,227 options outstanding, at exercise prices between 139.00p and 240.83p, are now potentially dilutive, as settlement would be made by the issue of new shares.
Details of other awards exercisable at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 are disclosed in note 28, together with the total number of awards outstanding for each scheme.

Following the acquisition of the REIT Group in September 2008, the business was re-organised into two distinct business segments: investment management and property asset management: these are separate business operations and are regarded as reportable segments under IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
These business segments represent the cash generating units CGUs and the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Board and tested for impairment.
The goodwill existing prior to the REIT acquisition was split between these two segments on the basis of the values in use of the respective business operations and resulted in 102.7m being allocated to property asset management, leaving 467.2m attributable to investment management.
The additional goodwill arising during the year relates to the acquisition of the REIT Group, whilst the goodwill disposed of reflects the 30% transfer of F&Cs existing property business to the former owners of REIT: both amounts relate to the property asset management business segment.
Details of the acquisition and disposal are given in note 16.

Goodwill and other intangible assets contd The movement in the carrying value of goodwill during the year, across reportable business segments, is as follows: 31 December 2008 31 December 2007 Investment Property asset Entire management management Total business Note m m m m At 1 January 569.9 569.9 569.9 Allocation to property segment 102.7 102.7 Additions 56.0 56.0 Disposals 16 b 30.8 30.8 At 31 December 467.2 127.9 595.1 569.9 Goodwill is not amortised but requires to be tested for impairment annually.
The carrying value of goodwill attributable to each business segment has been tested for impairment at the balance sheet date, as described below.
Accumulated goodwill impairment losses at 31 December 2008 were nil for both business segments 31 December 2007: nil.
Management contracts Management contracts predominantly relate to the value of investment management contracts arising on business acquisitions.
The addition during the year of 71.3m is the value attributed to the management contracts acquired through the acquisition of REIT.
The management contract impairment losses recognised during the year and the accumulated impairment losses at 31 December 2008 of 218.3m relate entirely to the investment management business segment.
Details of impairment recognised in the year are discussed below.
The foreign exchange gains in the year arise from the significant relative strengthening of the Euro over the course of 2008, adding value to contracts denominated in that currency, primarily F&C insurance contracts, in Sterling terms.
The categories of management contracts, their carrying amounts at the year-end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 31 December 2008 31 December 2007 Remaining Remaining Net book amortisation Estimated Net book amortisation Estimated vaues period useful life values period useful life m years years m years years RSAI insurance contracts 2.4 3 10 3.1 4 10 RSAI retail contracts F&C OEICs 17.9 3 6 10 36.3 4 7 10 F&C insurance contracts 100.2 6 10 89.4 7 10 F&C institutional contracts fixed term non-fixed term 29.4 6 2 10 4 47.0 7 3 10 4 1 1 F&C investment trust contracts 16.1 7 2 10 27.2 8 2 10 F&C advisory and sub-advisory contracts 32.0 6 10 49.6 7 10 Private equity fund of funds 1.0 16 20 1.1 17 20 REIT property contracts 67.9 7 7 266.9 253.7 Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill The recoverable amount of the CGUs has been determined on their value in use including terminal value at each respective testing date for 2007 and 2008.
The value in use is calculated by discounting the cash flow projections based on the latest annual financial budget approved by the Board.
A long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows because of the long-term nature of the Groups businesses making up the CGUs and the Boards current view that there is no reason to believe that they will not continue in operation in perpetuity.
Goodwill and other intangible assets contd The key assumptions adopted in these calculations for each business segment are as follows: 31 December 2008 31 December 2007 Investment Property asset management management Entire business Discount rate 10.15% 10.15% 8.50% Year Year Year Year Year Year Year Year Year 12 3 12 3 12 3 Market growth rate 0.00% 6.00% 5.55% 4.15 % 0.00% 4.15% 5.85% 5.85% 5.85% Inflation rate 3.75% 3.75% 3.75% 3.75% 4.00% 4.00% The costs included in Year 1 of the projections reflect those included in the Board approved budget for 2009.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital to estimate a market relevant rate, calculated as at the year-end, and takes into account the relative risks associated with the Groups various revenue streams.
All discount rates shown subsequently within this note are stated after tax.
Revenues for the first year are based on the Board-approved budget.
In year two, revenues have been grown at market rates estimated to be experienced in 2010 when the Board anticipate capital markets may begin to recover: these estimates are based on a combination of in-house and analysts views in light of the current, continued depression of markets.
Beyond this, revenues have been grown in line with the Groups long-term view of market growth, consistent with that experienced historically, in the long-term, across the markets in which assets are invested.
The different rates reflect the composite mix of assets held in each business segment and at each balance sheet date.
Revenues earned from significant contracts with a fixed term are assumed to terminate at the end of the fixed term, with operating costs falling by an amount which assumes associated profit margins of 70%.
Projected operating costs for the first year are driven by the budgeted profit margins for each business segment for 2009.
Thereafter costs have been grown at inflation rates to accord with anticipated future salary and other cost increases.
Values in use are compared to the carrying values of goodwill, attributable management contracts and other intangible assets net of associated deferred tax provisions, and property, plant and equipment in order to ascertain whether any impairment exists.
As this annual impairment review of goodwill determined surpluses in both segments, no impairment has been recognised in the year in respect of goodwill 31 December 2007: nil.
The key assumptions to which the calculated values in use are most sensitive are as follows: 31 December 2008 31 December 2007 Investment Property asset management management Entire business Discount rate 10.15% 10.15% 8.50% Long-term market growth rate 5.55% 4.15% 5.85% Inflation rate 3.75% 3.75% 4.00% The above assumptions result in the following surpluses of goodwill: 31 December 2008 31 December 2007 Investment Property asset management management Entire business m m m Excess of recoverable amount over carrying value 74.4 55.0 878.1 In order to assess the sensitivity of the key assumptions on the carrying values of goodwill, an analysis was conducted to ascertain the change that would be required to derive values in use which approximated to the carrying values of goodwill, and beyond which impairment would arise.
85 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 13.
Goodwill and other intangible assets contd The absolute levels, on a standalone basis, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the values in use to the carrying values of goodwill were as follows: 31 December 2008 31 December 2007 Investment Property asset management management Entire business Discount rate 11.00% 12.40% 14.70% Long-term market growth rate 5.15% 1.65% 3.40% Inflation rate 4.25% 7.20% 7.10% Intangible assets with finite lives During 2008, the significant fall in equity market levels and consequent reduction in management fee revenues arising from management contracts was considered to be an indicator of potential impairment of certain management contract intangible assets.
Historically, the sole indicator of impairment has been where actual fund outflows were significantly greater than the levels that had originally been forecast when the asset was initially recognised or when subsequent impairment had arisen.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, a full impairment review of these assets was undertaken as at 31 December 2008.
The review has resulted in impairment losses being recognised in respect of the assets below, across reportable business segments as follows: 2008 2007 Investment Property asset Entire management management Total business m m m m RSAI retail contracts F&C OEICs 11.3 11.3 F&C institutional contracts 10.5 10.5 F&C investment trust contracts 7.9 7.9 F&C advisory and sub-advisory contracts 18.6 18.6 Total impairment recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 48.3 48.3 No indicators of potential impairment existed in 2007 and therefore no impairment reviews of management contracts were undertaken in respect of that year.
The recoverable amounts of the assets have been determined based on value in use calculations using cash flow projections, for each contract category, based on the latest annual financial budget approved by the Board.
Goodwill and other intangible assets contd The key assumptions adopted in the calculations are as follows: Discount rate Market growth rates Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 RSAI retail contracts F&C OEICs 10.65% 0.00% 7.50% 6.35% F&C institutional contracts fixed term 9.65% 0.00% 5.90% 5.60% F&C institutional contracts non-fixed term 10.65% 0.00% 5.90% 5.60% F&C investment trust contracts 10.65% 0.00% 8.95% 6.85% F&C advisory and sub-advisory contracts 10.65% 0.00% 6.35% 5.80% The discount rates reflect the varying risks and uncertainties inherent in the revenues from the underlying assets, using the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 10.15%, calculated as at 31 December 2008, as a benchmark.
Consistent with the Board-approved budget for 2009, revenues for the first year of the projections assume no market growth.
The different rates across the contract types reflect the composite mix of asset classes held in each category: the actual growth rates applied to each asset class are identical to those used in the goodwill impairment reviews.
The projections are derived using the estimated useful lives of the underlying contracts and assume a constant loss of revenues over the projection periods, except in the case of fixed term contracts.
Projected operating costs have been driven by the reportable business segment projected operating profit margins, as determined for the purposes of the goodwill impairment review, including the cost inflation assumptions inherent therein, noted above.
Impairment has been determined by comparing the results of the value in use calculations at the year-end to the carrying values cost less aggregate amortisation and prior years impairment of the assets at 31 December 2008, with any deficits arising constituting impairment to be recognised for the year.
Following the impairment recognised in 2006, the Board revised its estimate at that time of the remaining useful lives of the impaired assets.
This year, however, impairment has arisen for a different reason, as noted above, and the driver behind the 2008 impairment charge is not considered to affect the longevity of the contracts.
Hence, there has been no change in accounting estimate in respect of their remaining useful lives.

Financial investments The following assets are designated as available for sale: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 m m Unquoted investments 2.1 3.8 Unquoted investments include the Groups direct investment, co-investments and carried interest entitlement in private equity limited partnerships.
The fair value of the unquoted investments has been estimated using International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
The Directors believe that the estimated fair values resulting from the valuation technique applied to unquoted shares which are recorded in the Balance Sheet, and the related realised fair value gains recorded in the Income Statement, are reasonable and the most appropriate at the balance sheet date.
The investments have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
Included within the unquoted financial investments at 31 December 2008 are 0.2m 31 December 2007: 0.3m of equity instruments measured at the price of recent investments.
The fair value of these investments cannot be measured reliably as the Group does not have access to the underlying information to produce fair value valuations for these investments.
These investments consist of loans and carried interest in private equity limited partnerships.
These investments are managed by external fund managers and the Group obtains returns when the investments are realised.
The Group intends to hold these investments until all the private equity investments are realised.
In 2008, the Group received distributions totalling 0.9m 2007: 3.9m which comprised 0.9m 2007: 3.8m of investment income and nil 2007: 0.1m return of capital in respect of the investments held at cost.
An impairment charge of 0.1m 2007: nil arose in respect of unquoted investments in 2008.
Investment in associates Prior to December 2007 the Group held an investment in an associate limited liability partnership, ISIS EP LLP, which acquired the private equity business previously owned by the Group.
F&C held a 19.99% stake in this business until the investment was terminated by an agreed Deed of Retirement in December 2007 resulting in ISIS EP LLP no longer being an associate of the Group at the end of 2007.
The movement in the carrying amount of investments in associates is analysed below: 2008 2007 m m At 1 January 1.4 Share of profit for the year 0.6 Distributions of profits received in the year 1.9 Further distribution due on termination of investment agreement included in trade and other receivables 0.1 At 31 December 2008 2007 m m Share of associates revenues and profits: Revenues 3.3 Profits 0.6 Under the terms of the Partnership Deed, F&C was entitled to a share of profit from ISIS EP LLP.
The share of the profit which the Group was entitled to was a cascade calculation of both a fixed and variable element of any profit arising, after priority was given to the fixed share of profit attributable to the other members of the partnership.
Accordingly, the Groups 19.99% interest in ISIS EP LLP did not equate to the actual profit entitlement of the Group.
Under the terms of the Deed of Retirement from ISIS EP LLP, F&C received 1.0m in 2007 and 1.0m in 2008 in respect of its transfer of B capital.
The remaining 0.5m due from ISIS EP LLP in respect of its disposal of B capital will be received in 2009 and is included within trade and other receivables as at 31 December 2008.

Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries a Acquisition of REIT Property Asset Management Group F&C Asset Management plc FCAM acquired and gained control of the REIT Property Asset Management Group REIT Group on 3 September 2008.
As part of this transaction, FCAM has relinquished 30% of its beneficial entitlement in F&C Property Asset Management plc F&C PAM by transferring its interest into the newly created F&C REIT Asset Management LLP F&C REIT Group property business, which is 30% minority owned.
F&C REIT ownership interests are initially split 70% ownership of A and B partnerships units held by FCAM, 30% of A units by Kendray Properties Limited, 22.5% of B units by Leo No and 7.5% of B units by Ivor Smith the latter three being collectively known as the REIT Parties.
A units entitle the holder to profits earned by the overseas sub-group within the F&C REIT Group and B units entitle the holder to profits earned by the other entities within this Group.
For each financial year ending on or before 31 December 2014 in which the Earnings Before Interest Taxation Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA of the F&C REIT Group is 45 million or more, FCAM will transfer up to 3.33% of its existing holding of A and B units in F&C REIT to the REIT Parties, subject to a maximum aggregate transfer of 10%.
The F&C REIT members generally share in the capital, profits and losses of F&C REIT Group in proportion to their respective ownership interests in F&C REIT.
However, where certain EBITDA targets are met in any financial year ending on or before 31 December 2013, the REIT Parties may be entitled to receive an uplift in their profit allocation for that year, subject to having a maximum profit allocation of 45% in any financial year.
The F&C REIT Group is governed by the F&C REIT Board, comprising Leo No, Ivor Smith, Nick Criticos, Alain Grisay and David Logan.
FCAM acquired 70% ownership of F&C REIT Asset Management LLP, which in turn owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of the following entities: F&C REIT Asset Management S.. r. l. Adebai Limited F&C REIT Asset Management Sweden AB F&C REIT Asset Worldwide Limited F&C REIT Asset Management GmbH & Co KG F&C REIT Property Management India Pvt Limited REIT Asset Management Limited REIT Corporate Services Limited REIT Corporate Directors Limited REIT Corporate Finance Limited RCF Directors Limited Tier Services Limited 70% of the REIT Group was acquired from the REIT Parties for an initial consideration of 25.0m in cash, issue of a 35.0m Floating Rate Secured Loan Note and the transfer of 30% of F&C PAM.
While FCAM transferred F&C PAM, a subsidiary undertaking, into the F&C REIT Group, it retains a 70% beneficial holding in F&C PAM via its 70% holding in F&C REIT.
The total consideration paid for the Groups 70% holding in F&C REIT is as follows: m Initial consideration cash 25.0 Initial consideration loan notes 35.0 Fair value of consideration in respect of sacrifice of 30% of F&C PAM 28.2 Fair value of consideration paid for 70% of the REIT Group 88.2 Estimated expenses of acquisition of which 0.2m is accrued at 31 December 2008 4.4 Total consideration 92.6 90 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008 16.
Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries contd The fair values of assets and liabilities acquired are as follows: Provisional fair value to the Group at acquisition, as Book Acquired Fair value at 31 December value intangibles adjustments 2008 m m m m Non-current assets: Property, plant and equipment 0.6 0.6 Intangible assets management contracts 34.0 71.3 34.0 71.3 Current assets: Trade and other receivables 0.9 0.2 1.1 Cash and short-term deposits 0.2 0.2 Non-current liabilities: Deferred tax 20.0 20.0 Current liabilities: Trade and other payables 0.9 0.9 Current tax payable 0.1 0.1 Estimated net assets acquired 34.7 51.3 33.8 52.2 Less: Minority interests share of net assets 15.6 Goodwill 56.0 Total consideration 92.6 As part of the transaction the fair value of the combined business was agreed as follows: m Fair value of F&C PAM 94.1 Fair value of REIT Group 126.0 Total value of combined business 220.1 m F&Cs 70% share of the combined business 154.1 The REIT Parties have the right to require F&C to acquire all or part of their membership interests in F&C REIT at a valuation determined by an independent valuer, subject to an overall cap on F&Cs liability of 100.0 million.
Leo Nos option is exercisable after the seventh anniversary of Completion and Ivor Smiths option is exercisable after the third anniversary of Completion.
While Kendray Properties Limited does not have any direct right to require F&C to acquire its holding in F&C REIT, under the terms of the Partnership Agreement Kendray cannot hold a greater interest in F&C REIT than the aggregate of Leo No or Ivor Smith or the holder of their beneficial interest and is therefore effectively required to transfer an element of its holding such that this requirement is achieved.
The consideration for such a transfer would be fair value.
Hence, in determining the gross liability of the option, Kendray Properties Limiteds entire holding in F&C REIT has been included.
The option liabilities are given in note 30.
On Completion, this option is recognised as a liability of 66.0m, being the fair value of 30% of F&C REIT, with the initial charge being taken to equity.
The following adjustments have been made to the book values of the assets and liabilities acquired: An adjustment of 0.2m has been made in respect of an estimation of the additional cash which the minority partners will require to inject into the business in accordance with the transaction agreements.
The amount of 34.0m has been excluded from the fair value of intangible assets acquired and replaced by the recognition of 71.3m for REIT management contracts, being their fair value at acquisition.
Further details of intangible assets are given in note 13.
The value of goodwill arising on acquisition takes account of the value of the property asset management team acquired and the value of future new business flows.
91 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 16.
Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries contd The Directors consider the fair values of the net assets acquired to be provisional until the REIT Completion Accounts review process has been finalised.
In the meantime, the adjustments reflect the Directors best estimates of the necessary fair value adjustments to the net assets of the acquired entities.
No provisions for re-organisation or restructuring costs are included in the liabilities of the acquired entities.
The profit before tax attributable to the acquired element of the F&C REIT Group for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date was 3.2m.
As a result of the acquired entities not being operated as a group prior to acquisition and the associated restructuring which was performed before the acquisition by F&C, it is not possible to determine what the Group results and cashflows would have been had the acquisition been completed on 1 January 2008. b Loss on partial disposal of property business As noted above, the Group disposed of 30% of its property business via the relinquishment of 30% of its ownership of F&C PAM.
The loss on disposal is quantified below: m Fair value of deemed consideration on disposal of 30% of F&C PAM 28.2 Less: Share of net assets attributable to 30% of F&C PAM, being transferred to minority interests 1.5 Less: Goodwill attributable to share of business transferred 30.8 Loss on disposal 4.1 c Acquisition of F&C Group Holdings Limited Following the review of the Completion Accounts and subsequent fair value adjustments to the purchase consideration for the acquisition of F&C Group Holdings Limited on 11 October 2004, there is an estimated further consideration of 2.9m payable to Eureko B.

Deferred tax has been provided on the unremitted earnings of the Groups foreign operations to the extent that it is planned for these companies to distribute profits in the foreseeable future.
c Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities The Group has unrecognised tax losses which arose in the UK of 0.2m 31 December 2007: 0.2m that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they cannot be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group, and they have arisen in companies that have not reported taxable profits for some time.
Financial instruments a Analysis ofBalanceSheet assets Financial investments held in relation to the activities of the Groups insurance subsidiary have been classified as fair value through profit or loss within current assets.
Stocks of units and shares are held in relation to fund management activities and are classified as held for trading within current assets.
Financial investments included within non-current assets are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value or amortised cost if fair value cannot be measured reliably.
Other receivables included within non-current assets are carried at amortised cost.

From F&Cs perspective, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management, as the financial risks and rewards attributable to the assets invested fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, the Groups clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of this subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact on the level of management fees which are earned from this entity and which are directly affected by the underlying value of policyholder assets.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table: Securities The fair value of listed investments is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date without any deduction for transaction costs.
The fair value of unlisted investments has been valued in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines and in accordance with the underlying limited partnership agreements.
Interest bearing loans and non-equity shares The fair value of the Subordinated Notes is based on a quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of other borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The valuations have considered similar instruments available in the market and the liquidity of assets and liabilities.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the balance sheet date.

Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates.
Short-term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2008 is 269.8m 31 December 2007: 274.4m.
Restrictions on use of cash The policyholders cash is not available for general use by the Group.

This includes a number of vacant or sub-let properties which were either previously occupied by the Group or are only partially occupied by the Group.
Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments where significant, after taking into account existing and expected sub-tenant contractual arrangements.
The remaining terms are for up to 13 years, although a significant element of this provision relates to lease incentive arrangements and is expected to be utilised within 3 years.
Assumptions have been made as to whether each leasehold property may be sub-let or assigned in the future.
All leases, and the majority of sub-leases, are for minimum guaranteed rentals.
One sub-lease involves the possible receipt of contingent rent.
Any contingent rent received in excess of the anticipated amount is recognised as income during the period.
The provision is subject to uncertainties over time including market rent reviews and break-options within the lease arrangements.
NIC on share schemes The provision for National Insurance Contributions NIC on share schemes represents the potential NIC liabilities in respect of a number of share-based payment schemes operated by the Group.
The provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of the extent to which performance conditions are met, movements in the Companys share price, the extent to which awards lapse and, where eligible, the timing of when employees choose to exercise options.
The current element of the provision for NIC on share schemes relates to awards which are expected to vest within one year.
At 31 December 2008 3.2m 31 December 2007: 3.3m of financial investments were held by the Group to partially fund the NIC liability on the Deferred Investment Plan and Deferred Investment Option Plan.
This is disclosed in note 19.
Long-term sickness The Group has long-term sickness insurance arrangements which cover the cost of absence from work of all current employees.
However, the cost of employees who went on long-term absence prior to these arrangements being established are self-insured by the Group.
The provision represents the present value of income protection payments due to these individuals.
This provision has been quantified on the assumption that all employees currently on long-term sick leave do not return to the employment of the Group.
The discount rate and salary growth assumptions used in each year are identical to those used for the purposes of determining UK defined benefit pension obligations.
Guaranteed product The provision for the guaranteed product represents the actuarially assessed cost of meeting potential obligations under certain investment products which have a guaranteed payout in the event of death of the investor.
This provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of movements in market levels and the mortality rates of investors.
The underlying investment plan was closed to new investors during 2004.
101 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 26.
Provisions contd Long-term service award This provision represents the non-current obligation in respect of long-term service benefits to which some employees are entitled, including incremental holiday entitlement and long-term service awards.
Investment Trust VAT On 5 November 2007, HM Revenue and Customs HMRC agreed that management services to UK Investment Trust Companies ITCs should be exempt from VAT.
As a result, the Group no longer applies VAT to investment management fees charged to UK investment trust clients.
A number of Group companies, in common with other asset managers in the UK, received claims from ITCs for the repayment of VAT charged to them for historic periods dating back to 1990.
While the Group charged VAT in accordance with applicable UK law at the time, a provision was recognised in 2007 to the extent that the expected payments to be made to ITCs are greater than the expected amount recoverable from HMRC.
During 2008 monies refunded from HMRC have been paid, as required, to ITCs.
However, due to the complexity of the repayment process and its interaction with contractual arrangements, uncertainty still exists as to the final cost to be incurred by the Group.
The provision of 3.8m at 31 December 2007: 3.9m represents the estimate of the expected liability of the Group.
Employee benefits Pension scheme obligations The Group operates a defined benefit scheme in the United Kingdom, one in The Netherlands, one in the Republic of Ireland, and participates in one in Portugal.
The UK scheme is closed to new entrants.
All new UK employees are eligible to benefit from defined contribution arrangements, which provide greater certainty over the future cost to the Group.
The Chairman of the Group, Mr R W Jenkins, has a pension entitlement of 100,000 per annum, commencing on his 60th birthday.
This pension will be indexed in line with the Retail Price Index on 1 January each year with effect from 11 October 2004, the date of the pension award.
The Group has not earmarked any assets to date with respect to this liability.
The pension obligations are recognised under non-current liabilities in the Balance Sheet and are stated gross of the related deferred tax asset.
The results of the latest full actuarial valuations were updated at 31 December 2008 by qualified independent actuaries.
The pension deficits surpluses of the Group are summarised as follows: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 m m F&C Asset Management Pension Plan 13.9 21.4 F&C Portugal pension 0.2 0.1 F&C Netherlands pension 4.8 2.9 F&C Ireland pension 0.6 0.2 R W Jenkins pension 2.3 2.4 Total pension deficit 21.8 26.8 Disclosure relating to the Groups defined benefit obligations The information given in 1 to 4 overleaf reflects the aggregate disclosures in respect of all Group defined benefit pension arrangements.

Other assets consist of assets held in insurance contracts in respect of The Netherlands scheme and some property assets.
The plan assets do not include Ordinary Shares issued by the Company or Friends Provident plc.
Expected long-term rates of return applied to UK funded defined benefit assets are as follows: 31 December 31 December Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 2008 2007 Equities 7.00% 7.00% Government bonds 5.00% 5.00% LDI Pools 3.30% 4.50% Cash 2.00% 4.50% Other 7.00% 7.00% Expected returns are shown for the UK obligations only.
Basis used to determine the expected rate of return on plan assets To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for the future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the actual asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
2 Major assumptions used by schemes Actuaries in respect of benefit obligations i Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used for the main UK defined benefit scheme and the unfunded UK obligation are: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 Mortality table for males retiring in the future PMA92MCYOB 1 PMA92MCYOB 1 Mortality table for females retiring in the future PFA92MCYOB 1 PFA92MCYOB 1 Mortality table for current male pensioners PMA92MCYOB 1 PMA92MCYOB 1 Mortality table for current female pensioners PFA92MCYOB 1 PFA92MCYOB 1 In 2008 the mortality assumption of the F&C Ireland scheme was updated.
There was change in the compulsory purchased annuity rates used to value liabilities for 2008, with the new rates allowing for more conservative mortality rates.
In 2007 the mortality assumption of the F&C Netherlands scheme was updated to the Prognosetafel 2008-2050.
103 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 27.
Employee benefits Pension scheme obligations contd ii Impact of mortality assumptions To demonstrate what these mortality assumptions mean in respect of the UK Plan, the expected ages at death of members retiring at age 60 are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 Years Years Expected age at death for a male retiring in the future at age 60 89 89 Expected age at death for a female retiring in the future at age 60 92 92 Expected age at death for a current male pensioner aged 60 88 88 Expected age at death for a current female pensioner aged 60 91 91 iii Cost of annuities The table below summarises the cost of providing annuities of 1 per annum with associated death benefits and pension increases for UK members aged 60 based on the assumptions used for the pension disclosures: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 Male annuity 21.30 23.50 Female annuity 21.10 24.00 These rates assume a monthly payments model with a discount rate of 6.10% 2007: 5.60% based, with appropriate adjustments, on the iBoxx over 15 year AA corporate bond index of 6.71% 2007: 5.82%.
The rates also assume two thirds of the members benefit will be paid to the spouse: a 5-year guarantee is provided: and pensions in excess of GMP will increase by 3.10% 2007: 3.30% per annum.
iv Discount and growth assumptions The range of assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 Discount rate 5.70% 6.10% 5.50% 5.60% Rate of salary increase 2.50% 4.35% 2.50% 4.55% Rate of inflation increase 2.00% 3.10% 2.00% 3.30% The range of assumptions used to determine net pension cost for the year are as follows: 2008 2007 Discount rate 5.50% 5.60% 4.60% 5.00% Weighted average expected long-term return on plan assets 5.50% 6.30% 3.90% 6.45% Rate of inflation increase 2.00% 3.30% 1.75% 3.00% Rate of salary increase 2.50% 4.55% 2.50% 4.25% v Sensitivities An estimate of the sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the schemes liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Estimated impact on scheme liabilities Inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 1.7% Salaries Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 0.4% Pensions Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 1.2% Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 2.3% Life expectancy Increase decrease by 1 year Increase decrease by 1.9% 104 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008 27.

The F&C Management Pension Plan merged into the ISIS Asset Management plc Pension Fund ISIS Fund on 31 March 2007.
The enlarged scheme was renamed the F&C Asset Management Pension Plan on the same date.
The Plans assets, which are managed by F&C, are held under the control of the Trustees and are used to secure benefits for the members of the Plan and their dependants in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules.
Trustee Board of the FCAM Plan The appointment of Trustees is determined by the FCAM Plans trust documentation.
The Trustee Board currently consists of three employer-appointed Trustees, three member-selected Trustees and two Independent Trustees, one of whom is currently the Chairman of the Trustee Board.
Of the current employer-appointed and member-selected Trustees, four are employees of F&C and active members of the FCAM Plan, one is a deferred member and one is retired and receiving a pension from the FCAM Plan.
Relationship between F&C and the Trustees of the FCAM Plan The FCAM Plans assets are held in a separate Trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustees of the Plan are required to act in the best interests of the Plans beneficiaries.
Other pension schemes F&C Portugal SA Certain employees in Portugal participate in the multi-employer scheme Fundo fide Pensoes do Grupo Banco Commercial Portugus.
The assets and liabilities of the scheme are separately identifiable.
There are no Trustees, and the Company controls the assets relating to the F&C members of the scheme.
F&C Netherlands BV The Group insures the scheme liabilities in The Netherlands with an insurance company.
There are no Trustees, but the Works Council has input into negotiations on potential changes to the Plan.
107 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 27.
Employee benefits Pension scheme obligations contd F&C Ireland Limited Employee pension benefits in Ireland were historically provided through the Friends First Retirement and Death Benefits Plan, in which F&C participated together with Friends First.
Prior to the start of 2007 when F&C Ireland set up a separate defined benefit plan, this was accounted for as a multi-employer plan on a defined contribution basis.
In 2007 the assets and liabilities attributable to the new F&C Ireland scheme were transferred into the F&C Ireland Pension Fund from the Friends First Retirement and Death Benefits Plan.
6 Future funding requirements UK schemes A revised schedule of contributions for the merged plan was agreed in June 2008.
The Group has paid contributions in line with this schedule since its adoption.
For the first part of the year the Group contributed at the rate of 0.2m per month.
The Group has agreed to pay contributions of a minimum of 29.6% of Pensionable Salaries until 1 March 2009 and 28.1% of Pensionable Salaries thereafter.
In addition, the Group will pay 1.5m per annum until 30 June 2011 and 16,000 per month until March 2011.
Employee contributions are payable via a salary sacrifice scheme in addition to the Group contributions.
The rates of employee contributions payable are increasing on a phased basis until March 2009.
Contributions are subject to review at future actuarial valuations.
The minimum estimated contribution expected to be paid into the Plan during the current financial year is 3.75m 2007: 2.8m.
As the FCAM Plan is a closed scheme, under the projected unit method the current service cost will tend to increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as the average age of members increases.
Overseas schemes The figures in the table below assume that contributions at the level paid in 2008 will continue for the overseas schemes.
Contributions to defined benefit schemes Amounts paid into the Groups defined benefit schemes in the past two years and expected future payments over the next five years are as follows: Contributions paid m 2007 12.5 2008 7.4 Expected future contributions m 2009 5.8 2010 5.8 2011 4.9 2012 4.1 2013 4.1 7 Risk management a UK schemes The Trustees set general investment policy but delegate the responsibility for the selection of specific investments other than investments in respect of members voluntary contributions to the investment manager.
The Trustees regularly monitor the Plans investments.
The Trustees seek advice from their investment adviser and believe they have sufficient skills and expertise to make investment decisions based on this advice.
The Trustees have set performance and risk targets for the investment manager.
The performance objectives are long-term, however, the Trustees monitor the investment manager on a regular basis in order to ensure that the scheme is on track to meet its long-term objectives.
Prior to the merger of the two schemes, both sets of Trustees conducted an asset-liability review.
These studies were used to assist the Trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the liabilities within the schemes, subject to an acceptable funding cost to the Group.
The results of the studies were also used to assist the Trustees and the Group in managing volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the schemes deficits by providing information used to determine the schemes investment strategy.
A further asset-liability review was undertaken alongside the 31 March 2007 actuarial valuation of the merged plan.
Employee benefits Pension scheme obligations contd Asset allocation Following the pre-merger asset-liability reviews, both sets of Trustees agreed with F&C that they would implement a Liability Driven Investment LDI approach to their investment strategy.
In both cases this involves the use of pooled LDI products managed by F&C.
Following completion of the post-merger asset-liability review, the Trustees, with the agreement of F&C, decided in principle to introduce more diversification into the Plans return-seeking asset investment strategy.
However, at the present time, in view of the currently highly unstable markets, the implementation of this strategy change has been delayed.
Interest rate and inflation risk The LDI pools are intended to help provide a degree of matching to the liabilities of the scheme.
Each pool comprises zero coupon derivatives with the same maturity as the expected cash flows of the scheme.
Each pool has leveraged exposure of varying amounts to inflation and interest rates.
The pools are valued using the market values of the underlying securities.
Currency risk In order to increase the diversification of the equity portfolio, the Plan invests in overseas assets.
However, the Plans liabilities are denominated entirely in Sterling and therefore there is a risk that the appreciation of Sterling against other currencies will reduce the return from overseas equities.
Operational risk The investment managers do not directly hold any of the Plans securities.
These are held by an external custodian.
The assets are ring fenced from F&Cs creditors and therefore transferable.
b Overseas schemes The plan in The Netherlands is financed via an insurance company.
The value of the Plan assets is the value of the reserve which the insurance company holds to match guaranteed pension liabilities.
These reserves are, in effect, fixed interest instruments, so provide a reasonable match to pension liabilities.
The Plan in Portugal is part of an industry-wide banking sector plan.
Each participant company holds a share of the assets, which are invested using the same asset allocation as the overall plan assets.
F&C Portugal is the asset manager for the overall scheme.
The Plan in Ireland invests in pooled unitised funds, with returns reflecting the performance of the underlying assets.
At 31 December 2008, the assets of both the F&C Portugal and F&C Ireland Plans were invested in diversified portfolios that consisted primarily of debt and equity securities.

Details of option pricing models and key assumptions used to obtain the fair value of services received, or the fair value of the equity instruments granted, have been disclosed only for awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2008.
Details of awards granted in previous accounting periods are disclosed in the notes of previous years Financial Statements.
The weighted average share price during 2008 was 1.25 2007: 1.93.
Employee benefits Share-based payments contd i 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme The 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 ESOS was activated in March 2003.
The vesting period for each award was three years and options are settled by an allotment of shares to individuals.
No cash alternative is available.
All options under the 2002 ESOS have now vested, as the performance criteria has been met.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of award, the options expire.
The number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of share options are as follows: 2008 2007 WAEP WAEP No.

ii 2002 Share Save Scheme The 2002 Share Save Scheme is an all-employee share scheme which was activated in March 2003.
The options granted entitle the holders to acquire Ordinary Shares, whether by subscription or purchase, at a price per Ordinary Share determined by the Directors prior to the issue of invitations.
The price at which options can be offered cannot be less than 80% of the middle-market quotation of an Ordinary Share at the date of grant.
As part of the application process, a participant is required to enter into a savings contract with a savings provider presently Yorkshire Building Society, and agree to make 36 in the case of a 3-year savings contract or 60 in the case of a 5-year contract monthly savings contributions of a fixed amount.
At the end of the savings contract, the participant may choose to apply for repayment of his or her savings contributions, in addition to a tax free bonus.
An option may only be exercised once and normally only during the period of six months after the date on which the participant first becomes entitled to repayment of his or her savings contributions plus bonus.
The option will generally lapse after a period of six months following the end of the savings contract.
Employees who are deemed good leavers are entitled to exercise their options, for which they have accrued savings to date, for a period of up to six months after they leave.
111 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 28.
Employee benefits Share-based payments contd The number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of share options are as follows: 2008 2007 WAEP WAEP No.
The options exercised during 2008 relate to both the vesting of the 9 May 2003 5 year award and good leavers.
The 29 April 2005 3 year award also vested during the year.
At 31 December 2008 the following options granted under the 2002 Share Save Scheme to acquire Ordinary Shares were outstanding: No.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of options granted is measured based on a Binomial model.
The contractual life of the option 3.5 or 5.5 years is used as an input to this model.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the model.
The cumulative expense is trued up during the vesting period and at the end of the vesting period after allowing for actual forfeitures.
iii The Re-Investment Plan The Re-Investment Plan was established to allow employees previously employed by F&C Group Holdings Group F&CGH prior to the 2004 merger to voluntarily re-invest one half of their entitlement under the F&CGH Shadow Equity Plan into Ordinary Shares in F&C Asset Management plc, and obtain rights to receive further Ordinary Shares in F&C Asset Management plc.
To encourage re-investment, and in recognition of the fact that the Investment Shares carried forfeiture provisions, after three years participants received up to one Matching Share for each Investment Share subject to continued employment and achievement of performance conditions.
One third of Matching Shares had no performance criteria, while the remaining two-thirds vested in line with EPS criteria.
Full details of the Re-Investment Plan were given in the 2007 Financial Statements.
Employee benefits Share-based payments contd The number of Investment Shares and Matching Share awards are as follows: 2008 2007 Investment Matching Investment Matching Shares Shares Shares Shares No.
Outstanding at 1 January 47,907 7,903,160 Exercised during the year 47,907 7,819,584 Forfeited during the year 83,576 Outstanding at 31 December The first and second tranches of the Investment Shares vested during 2005 and 2006 respectively.
The Matching Shares vested in 2007. iv The Long-Term Remuneration Plan LTRP The LTRP is the primary long-term incentive arrangement of the Group.
LTRP awards are made at the discretion of the Board.
a Restricted Share Awards Vesting of the Ordinary Shares that are currently the subject of an award under the LTRP will be dependent upon specified performance conditions and conditions of continued service.
The performance conditions applied to the LTRP are determined by the Board and are measured over a three year performance period: 50% of any award relates to the achievement of total shareholder return TSR targets and 50% of the award relates to real underlying EPS growth, as set out below: TSR target applying to 50% of any award The Groups TSR relative to FTSE 250 Percentage of award vesting Below Median Nil Median 35% Upper Quartile 100% Underlying EPS target applying to 50% of any award Growth in Groups EPS over three year performance period Percentage of award vesting Below PI 9% Nil PI 9% 50% PI 24% or higher 100% Where PI stands for an appropriate index of price inflation the Retail Price Index.
The TSR target is dependent upon the TSR of the Group compared to the TSR of the other companies who formed the FTSE 250 Index at the start of each performance period the comparator companies over a three year performance period commencing on the first day of the accounting period in which the award was made.
At the end of the performance period, the Group and each of the comparator companies the comparator list are listed and ranked in accordance with their TSR over the performance period.
The number of Ordinary Shares which vest would depend upon the ranking of the Group in the comparator list, in accordance with the vesting table above, described as follows: For below median TSR performance, no awards would vest: for TSR performance between the median and upper quartile 125th and 63rd position in the comparator list index, awards would vest on a straight-line basis between 35% for median and 100% for upper quartile.
The TSR measure reflects the movement in the value of shares plus any dividends declared during the relevant period.
It was chosen as the performance measure for the LTRP as it is directly related to movements in shareholder value.
113 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 28.
Employee benefits Share-based payments contd For levels of both TSR and underlying EPS performance between those shown in the tables above, any award that vests under the LTRP will vary on a straight-line basis between the minimum and maximum levels shown.
The number of restricted share awards is as follows: 2008 2007 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 852,656 6,506,759 Granted during the year 327,548 Exercised during the year 2,771,901 Forfeited during the year 8,827 3,209,750 Outstanding at 31 December 843,829 852,656 No award was made in 2008.
The EPS element of the award granted on 15 November 2004 vested in full on 15 November 2007.
The TSR element of the award was not achieved.
At 31 December 2008 the following LTRP restricted share awards were outstanding: No.
of options Earliest Exercise Grant date outstanding exercise date price 17 May 2006 516,281 17 May 2009 0.0p 16 March 2007 327,548 16 March 2010 0.0p assuming performance criteria satisfied.
The awards outstanding at 31 December 2008 have a weighted average outstanding term of 0.7 years 31 December 2007: 1.7 years.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share awards granted.
The estimate of the fair value of awards granted is measured at full market value for the EPS criteria and no valuation model is used for this element.
Monte Carlo Simulation is used to value the TSR criteria.
The contractual life of the award 3 years is used as an input to the TSR model.
The cash-settled element of the awards is based on dividends payable on the shares during the vesting period, prior to becoming unconditional, being notionally re-invested in F&C Asset Management plc shares.
Once the share awards vest, the value of the notional shares is paid to the employee in cash.
The value of dividend payments has been separated as these are settled in cash.
The cumulative grant expense is trued up, during the vesting period and at the end of the vesting period, after allowing for actual forfeitures and the underlying EPS achieved.
b Deferred Share Awards The Long Term Remuneration Plan allows deferred awards to be granted to employees below Executive Director level, subject only to a time-vesting period of three years.
The number of deferred share awards is as follows: 2008 2007 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 8,614,024 3,446,624 Granted during the year 10,216,710 5,911,422 Exercised during the year 273,606 89,712 Forfeited during the year 725,758 654,310 Outstanding at 31 December 17,831,370 8,614,024 Exercisable at 31 December 79,561 43,220 The awards exercised during 2008 and exercisable at 31 December 2008 relate to good leavers.
Employee benefits Share-based payments contd At 31 December 2008 the following awards granted under the LTRP deferred were outstanding: No.
The estimate of the fair value of awards granted is measured at full market value and no valuation model is used.
The cash-settled element of the deferred awards is based on dividends payable on the shares during the vesting period, prior to becoming unconditional, being notionally re-invested in F&C Asset Management plc shares.
The value of dividend payments has been separated from the valuation as these are settled in cash.
The key assumptions which have been used to ascertain the fair value of awards made during 2008 are as follows: 25 March 2008 13 May 2008 Equity Cash Equity Cash Fair value at measurement date per award 169.0p 16.25p 154.5p 15.0p Number of awards granted 10,142,964 73,746 Share price at grant date 185.25p 169.50p Exercise price 0.0p 0.0p Vesting period 3 years 3 years Full term of award 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 3.10% 3.10% Expected forfeiture rate per annum 5.00% 5.00% The cumulative grant expense is trued up during the vesting period and at the end of the vesting period after allowing for actual forfeitures.
v Purchased Equity Plan a F&C Asset Management plc shares The Purchased Equity Plan operates in conjunction with the discretionary bonus scheme and is intended to encourage shareholding by management and employees of the Group by providing for: The compulsory purchase of shares using annual bonus above a threshold level: and Voluntary purchase of shares using annual bonus, with associated Matching Shares.
No Voluntary Purchased Equity awards have been granted.
On an annual basis, eligible employees who are awarded in a financial year an aggregate bonus in excess of a threshold level of 100,000 100,000 in respect of the year ended 31 December 2007 will be required to defer one third of the element exceeding 100,000 100,000 in respect of the year ended 31 December 2007 into shares comprising either a range of investment products managed by the Group or the Companys shares Compulsory Purchased Equity for three years.
115 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 28.
Employee benefits Share-based payments contd The Compulsory Purchased Equity will not benefit from any form of matching award and is subject to forfeiture in the event that the employee leaves the Group for any reason other than as a good leaver in the three year retention period.
The number of Compulsory Purchased Equity Plan share awards is as follows: 2008 2007 No.
The awards exercised during 2008 and 2007 and exercisable at 31 December 2008 relate to good leavers.
At 31 December 2008 the following awards granted under the Purchased Equity Plan to acquire Ordinary Shares were outstanding: No.
of awards Earliest Exercise Grant date outstanding exercise date price 24 March 2006 792,495 24 March 2009 0.0p 13 April 2007 1,105,055 13 April 2010 0.0p 2 April 2008 78,044 2 April 2011 0.0p assuming performance criteria satisfied.
The awards outstanding at 31 December 2008 have a weighted average outstanding term of 0.9 years 31 December 2007: 1.5 years.
The cashsettled element of the awards is based on dividends payable on the shares during the vesting period, prior to becoming unconditional, being notionally re-invested in F&C Asset Management plc shares.
Once the share awards vest, the value of the notional shares is paid to the employees in cash.
The value of dividend payments is separated out, as these are settled in cash.
The key assumptions which have been used to ascertain the fair value of awards made during 2008 are as follows: 2 April 2008 Equity Cash Fair value at measurement date per award 160.0p 22.75p Number of awards granted 89,371 Share price at grant date 182.75p Exercise price 0.0p Vesting period 3 years Full term of award 51 months Expected dividend yield 3.10% Expected forfeiture rate per annum 5.00% The cumulative grant expense is trued up during the vesting period and at the end of the vesting period after allowing for actual forfeitures.
Employee benefits Share-based payments contd b F&C Investment Funds A new element was introduced into the Purchased Equity Plan in 2007 whereby the cash bonus is deferred on a mandatory basis into certain F&C Funds Compulsory Purchased Equity subject to continued service over either three or four years.
This option is now available in addition to the Compulsory Purchased Equity into F&C Asset Management plc FCAM plc shares.
The main benefit of this arrangement is to incentivise fund managers to invest in the funds they manage, thereby further aligning employee interests with those of clients.
The settlement of awards from the Compulsory Purchased Equity F&C Investment Funds is made by realisation of the holding in the fund at the vesting date and purchase of FCAM plc shares at that date.
The value of the investment in F&C Funds, the FCAM plc share price and hence the ultimate number of FCAM plc shares to be settled is only known with certainty at the vesting date.
Any dividends paid during the vesting period are used to buy further underlying F&C Investment Funds shares.
Although the awards meet the criteria of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment as the awards are ultimately settled in FCAM plc shares, it is not considered possible to reliably estimate the fair value of these awards at the grant date.
This is due to the number of market based criteria which ultimately combine to determine the number and value of FCAM plc shares settled.
Settlement of these awards to employees is satisfied by the purchase of FCAM plc shares in the market.
The fair value of these awards at the year end has been determined by measurement of the equity instruments at intrinsic value, being the quoted price of the relevant F&C Funds, both at the grant date and at each subsequent balance sheet date.
The intrinsic value is then spread over the vesting period.
The value of the services provided is measured using the ultimate value of awards which vest.
Awards totalling 2.5m were made on 2 April 2008 13 April 2007: 1.2m.
These awards were invested into a total of 24 13 April 2007: 26 eligible F&C Investment Funds, comprising OEICs and Investment Trusts.
The underlying investments are held within an Employee Benefit Trust.

The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share awards granted.
The cash-settled element of the deferred award is based on dividends payable on the shares during the vesting period, prior to becoming unconditional, being notionally re-invested in F&C Asset Management plc shares.
The cumulative expense is trued up during the vesting period and at the end of the vesting period after allowing for actual forfeiture.
vii The Executive Director Remuneration Plan The Executive Director Remuneration Plan EDRP was approved at the 2007 AGM.
Any Executive Director of the Company is eligible to participate in the EDRP.
The EDRP provides for the grant of two different forms of award, Restricted Share Awards and Deferred Share Awards.
a Restricted Share Awards The vesting of the Restricted Share Awards is dependent on the satisfaction of pre-determined performance conditions relating to the Underlying Earnings Per Share Underlying EPS performance of the Group.
Under this condition, a Restricted Share Award will only vest if the Groups Underlying EPS equals or exceeds the specified target for the year ending 31 December 2009.
On achievement of the specified target, 100% of the award will vest.
The participant can achieve a maximum enhanced level of vesting of 140% of the award by achieving an extremely stretching level of Underlying EPS.
Where the actual Underlying EPS exceeds the minimum vesting conditions but is less than the maximum enhanced level of vesting, then the percentage of the award that vests will be calculated on a straight-line basis between 100% and 140%.
The 2007 Restricted Share Award is subject to the following EPS hurdle: Underlying EPS for the year ending 31 December 2009 Percentage of Restricted Share Awards Vesting 18.1p 100% 25.2p 140% 18.1p 25.2p Pro-rata between 100% and 140% on a straight-line basis Following vesting, shares will be held by Trustees, in a nominee capacity, throughout a fixed holding period at the end of which the shares may be transferred to the participant.
The holding period applicable to 50% of such vested shares will end on announcement of the 2010 year end results: the balance of vested shares will be subject to a further six month holding period.
During the holding period the participant will be eligible to receive dividends and exercise voting rights.
The number of Restricted Share Awards is as follows: 3 years 3.5 years 2008 2007 2008 2007 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 2,002,000 2,002,000 i Granted during the year 2,002,000 2,002,000 Outstanding at 31 December 2,002,000 2,002,000 2,002,000 2,002,000 i This represents the maximum number of restricted shares which could be achieved by the participants i. e. 140%.
No awards were made during 2008 or were exercisable at either 31 December 2008 or 31 December 2007.
Employee benefits Share-based payments contd At 31 December 2008 the following EDRP Restricted Share Awards were outstanding: Grant date No.

The estimate of fair value of awards granted is measured at full market value for EPS criteria and no valuation model is used.
Once the share awards vest, the value of the notional shares is paid to the participant in cash.
The cumulative grant expense is trued up during the vesting period and at the end of the vesting period after allowing for actual forfeitures.
b Deferred Share Awards Awards vest at the end of a three year period from grant date, subject to the continued employment of the participant within the Group.
There are no performance criteria attached to the deferred shares and the vested shares transfer to the participant as soon as possible after vesting.
The number of Deferred Share Awards is as follows: 2008 2007 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 1,500,574 Granted during the year 1,025,640 1,500,574 Outstanding at 31 December 2,526,214 1,500,574 No awards were exercised during 2008 or were exercisable at either 31 December 2008 or 31 December 2007.

viii F&C REIT variable minority interest SBP In accordance with the Partnership Agreement, the REIT minority partners Kendray Properties Limited, Leo No and Ivor Smith have the potential to increase their stake in F&C REIT Asset Management LLP F&C REIT collectively from 30% to 40%.
A variable minority interest was granted as an incentive to achieve increased levels of profit including realisation of future performance fees in return for a potential increased stake in the business.
This variable minority interest is therefore accounted for under IFRS2: Share-based Payment.
The fair value of the award at date of acquisition reflects the value assessed as part of the acquisition valuation.
This fair value will be spread over the relevant vesting period.
The minority partners have the potential to increase their stake in the F&C REIT partnership by 3.33% for every year in which the EBITDA performance target of 45.0m is achieved, up to a maximum of 10%.
Therefore, if the target was achieved in the first three years, no further increase would be possible.
The variable minority interest performance criteria could be achieved in any year of the six year period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2014.
The vesting period is uncertain but the maximum timescale to achieve full vesting for each 3.33% is in years 4, 5 and 6 respectively.
The Directors have assumed that 3.33% will vest in each of 2012, 2013 and 2014.
The expense for each tranche is being spread from the date of grant over 4, 5 and 6 years respectively.
However, the respective vesting period may be accelerated if the targets are achieved earlier.
If either Leo No or Ivor Smith should leave during this period, the variable minority interest could still convert to all the minority partners, so the remaining charge would be accelerated, subject to meeting the performance criteria.
The additional minority interest to which the minority partners will be entitled will be in proportion to their original partnership interest at the date of vesting.
If a partner left after one year he would sacrifice two thirds of his interest.
If a partner stays three years he is entitled to his proportionate share of the full 10%, subject to meeting the performance criteria.
Kendrays minority interest always varies in accordance with the underlying interests of Leo No and Ivor Smith.
Any variable minority interest sacrificed by a minority partner will remain part of FCAM plcs share of the LLP.
As the performance criteria is non-market based, to the extent that part or all of the performance criteria is not met then that proportion of the charge will be reversed, i. e. trued up.
At the outset it is considered likely that the full conversion will be achieved.
Therefore the IFRS2 charge to the Income Statement assumes full vesting.
Assumptions used in the model The fair value of the award was not based on an observable market price.
Award date 3 September 2008 Fair value of award 22.0m Percentage chance of meeting criteria 100% Vesting period 4-6 years Expected forfeiture rate 0% 120 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008 28.
Employee benefits Share-based payments contd ix 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme IFRS 2 Share-based Payment is only applied to grants of shares, share options or other equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and had not vested before 1 January 2005 i. e. the effective date of IFRS 2.
The 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS last granted options before 7 November 2002 and is not therefore subject to the full effects of IFRS 2 in terms of recognising an expense in the Income Statement.
The standard does, however, require certain disclosures to be made in respect of this Scheme.
The 1995 ESOS is an unapproved share option scheme, where participation was entirely at the discretion of the Directors.
The lifespan of the Scheme was ten years from the date on which it was approved by shareholders and accordingly no further options can be granted under the Scheme after 1 September 2005.
The vesting period is three years.
Options are settled by grant of shares to individuals.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Employees who are deemed good leavers are entitled to exercise their options for a period of one year after they leave, regardless of whether the vesting requirements have been met.
The option price shall not be less than the market value of a share on the dealing day or averaged over the three dealing days before the option is granted.
The exercise of options granted under the Scheme will be dependent on the achievement by the Company of specified thresholds of underlying earnings per share.
Options cannot be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of the grant.
Thereafter they can be exercised in whole or in part only when the underlying EPS percentage increase in each three consecutive years exceeds the RPI by at least 2% per annum.
The number and weighted average exercise price WAEP of share options are as follows: 2008 2007 WAEP WAEP No.
At 31 December 2008 the following options granted under the 1995 ESOS to acquire Ordinary Shares were outstanding: No.

Details are disclosed in note 16 a.
Investment contract liabilities Investment contract liabilities in respect of policyholder investments at the start and end of the year and an analysis of movements during the year are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Liability as at 1 January 1,090.1 1,175.1 Contributions received 197.1 96.7 Investment return applied 208.7 45.0 Charges levied 4.2 3.9 Repayments 268.6 215.3 Movement in reinsurance ceded 52.6 7.5 Liability as at 31 December 753.1 1,090.1 All investment contract liabilities have been disclosed as due within one year as this is considered to be appropriate to the rights of policyholders who have the right to withdraw their investments at short notice.
The Directors expect that the majority of the investment contract liabilities will be repayable outwith one year.
However, as the investment contracts are repayable on demand of the policyholders they have been disclosed within current liabilities.
Insurance contract liabilities Insurance contract liabilities include life assurance liabilities in respect of lifetime guarantees provided with certain investment products, and annuity liabilities in respect of pension investment contracts where the investor has retired.
These liabilities and related reinsurance balances at the start and end of the year, together with an analysis of movements in the year, are as follows: 2008 2007 Gross Reinsurance Net Gross Reinsurance Net Insurance contract liabilities m m m m m m At 1 January 2.3 2.3 2.4 2.4 Claims paid 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 Unwinding of discount rate 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Other changes in year 0.2 0.2 At 31 December 2.1 2.1 2.3 2.3 The reinsurance liabilities relate to annuity business reinsured with Friends Provident Pensions Limited.
A liability adequacy test was carried out at policy level and resulted in no additional provision for either 2008 or 2007.
No significant gain or loss arose on reinsurance contracts incepted in 2008 or 2007.
Assumptions The principal assumptions used in determining the insurance contract liabilities and the reinsurers share of these liabilities, and the process adopted to arrive at these assumptions are as follows: Mortality rates 2008 2007 Annuities in payment 83-94% PCXA00 81-94% PCXA00 i Projected thereafter using 100% of the average of medium and long cohort improvement factors for males 75.0% for females subject to a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1.50% for males 1.25% for females.
Due to the small number of annuity policies, the mortality assumptions reflect recent experience of the reinsurer together with an allowance for future mortality improvement.
Experience analysis for mortality is performed annually by the reinsurer.
Discount rate The discount rate used at 31 December 2008 is 4.52% 31 December 2007: 4.75% based on current fixed interest gross redemption yields, with a prudent adjustment for risk.

Reserves contd Nature and purpose of reserves Share premium account The share premium account is used to record the issue of share capital in excess of par value.
Merger reserve The merger reserve is used to record share premium on shares issued by way of consideration in respect of acquisitions.
The element of the merger reserve which relates to amortisation and impairment of intangible assets charged to the Income Statement is considered to be realised.
A transfer is made from the merger reserve to retained earnings to recognise the extent to which the merger reserve has been realised, thereby offsetting the corresponding element of the intangible amortisation charge.
Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the Financial Statements of foreign operations and non-Sterling denominated intangible assets.
Fair value reserve This reserve records fair value changes on available for sale investments until the investments are derecognised.
Acquisition reserve The acquisition reserve was created on the initial recognition of the minority interest put options liability.
Minority interests This reserve represents the share of the Groups net assets which are not attributable to equity holders of the parent, including the minority interests share of intangible assets arising from business combinations.
Retained earnings Retained earnings comprises: net profits and losses recognised through the Income Statement: actuarial gains and losses recognised on the pension liability: deferred tax on actuarial gains and losses: transactions relating to equity-settled share-based payments, and deferred tax movements on share-based payments reflected through equity: the purchase and sale of own shares: and transfer from merger reserve.

Contingencies Contingent liabilities: a Stocklending activities As part of its asset management responsibilities, the Group performed collateralised stock lending activities as agent for a number of its clients.
The unprecedented market turbulence, increased counterparty risk and counterparty failure rates encountered during the year resulted in the Group ceasing such activities.
In certain cases, the cessation was exercised through invoking default clauses in the relevant contracts, realisation of collateral held and the repurchase of stocks originally on loan.
However, the related termination calculations, setting out the realisations of collateral, the uses of the cash realised and net amounts due to or from principals under the relevant agreements have not yet been agreed for all clients.
In particular, in certain instances the collateral held may not be readily realisable in the current market conditions.
Whilst the Group acts in an agency capacity, it is possible that potential disputes may arise from the completion of these calculations.
The calculations have yet to be completed and therefore it is not possible to estimate the potential liability, if any, of the Group in these circumstances.
b Employment Tribunal A number of claims were made by a former employee against the Company at UK Employment Tribunal hearings during 2007 and 2008.
The Employment Tribunal initially decided six claims in favour of the Company and five in favour of the claimant.
The Company submitted appeals against these findings leading to the Employment Appeal Tribunal concluding in November 2008 that, as a result of fresh evidence supporting the Companys position, the five claims against the Company should be re-heard by a new Tribunal during 2009.
Whilst the claimant has sought 19.0m in compensation, no decision on damages, were the claimant to succeed, has been made at any time.
The Company will continue to defend vigorously its position at the Tribunal re-hearing.
Based on legal advice, the Directors do not believe there is a material financial exposure which should be separately reported at the balance sheet date.
c Ongoing business operations In the normal course of its business, the Group is subject to matters of litigation or dispute.
While there can be no assurances, at this time the Directors believe, based on the information currently available to them, that it is not probable that the ultimate outcome of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Group.
Commitments Operating leases The Group had the following future minimum rentals payable in respect of non-cancellable operating leases and other contracts at the year-end: Premises Other Contracts 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m Not later than one year 11.6 10.3 3.1 2.0 Later than one year and not later than five years 45.0 42.0 1.7 1.3 Later than five years 56.3 63.3 112.9 115.6 4.8 3.3 Obligations in respect of Other Contracts are stated gross and exclude amounts potentially recoverable from brokers under commission sharing arrangements.
Commitments in respect of premises leases exclude service charges and other costs, which are variable in nature, and cannot be reliably estimated.
Sub-lease receivables Future minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases at the year end are as follows: Premises 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 m m Not later than one year 4.1 4.0 Later than one year and not later than five years 11.0 10.1 Later than five years 6.8 8.4 21.9 22.5 A contingent lease payment, based on a percentage of revenue, is receivable in addition to the minimum lease payments in respect of one property.
The maximum amount receivable under this arrangement is 0.6m 31 December 2007: 0.6m per annum.
Capital commitments The amount contracted for in terms of capital expenditure, but not provided for in the Financial Statements at 31 December 2008 was nil 31 December 2007: 1.1m.
129 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 38.
Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to a number of business risks.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Group's risk management arrangements, but has delegated the implementation and operation of the Board policies to Management.
The Group's risk management policies and the risk management framework for identifying, monitoring and managing risks across the Group, including strategic and operational risks, are detailed in the Directors' Report on Corporate Governance on pages 41 and 42.
As an asset management business, the Directors consider it appropriate to differentiate between those financial risks which directly impact the Group and those which indirectly impact the Group due to the risks borne by our clients and the consequential impact on the Group's assets under management and revenues.
The Group's direct or indirect exposure to financial instruments arises from the following financial risks: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk This note presents information on the Group's direct or indirect exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Group's capital.
Note 39 provides numerical analysis of the Group's financial instrument exposure to such risks, including relevant sensitivity analysis, at the balance sheet date.
Indirect earnings risk through client assets As an active fund manager the Group is responsible for managing assets in accordance with the mandates specified by our clients.
The assets managed by the Group are subject to varying financial risks market, credit and liquidity.
While these risks could result in financial loss or gain through a change in asset value, these risks and rewards are fully borne by, or fall to the benefit of, our clients.
However, as the majority of the Group's revenues are quantified as a percentage of assets under management generally on a quarterly or monthly basis, the Group's income is impacted by movements in client assets which are caused by the exposure to financial risks.
As a result of the direct link of revenues to the value of client assets, the Group's interests are aligned to those of our clients.
A key risk to our business is that of poor investment performance, which could lead to the subsequent loss of client mandates.
A key role of the Heads of Equities and Fixed Income is to monitor the fund performance achieved by our investment professionals.
Where it is necessary, actions are taken to change process or personnel with a view to attaining top quartile performance.
The Group has the ability to earn performance fees from a number of our clients, where out-performance of the benchmark or set objective is achieved.
These arrangements reinforce the alignment of the Group's interests with those of our clients.
The key components of financial risk to which our clients are exposed are: Market risk the risk of financial loss arising from changes in the market prices of assets.
Market risks include exposure to all asset classes, including equities, fixed income products and property as well as currency risk and interest rate risk.
Credit risk the risk of financial loss if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations in respect of assets held within client portfolios.
Credit risk can vary by asset class and individual instrument.
Liquidity risk the risk of financial loss to client portfolios because a client does not have sufficient financial resources available and is unable to realise assets in order to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only realise assets by suffering financial loss.
Prior to 2008, the Group did not hedge any of its revenue exposure to movements in the value of client assets arising from any of these risks.
During 2008, following significant strengthening of the Euro against Sterling, the Group's reporting currency, the Group entered into a series of forward currency contracts to partially hedge future Euro-denominated revenue streams for the remainder of 2008 and beyond.
Financial risk management contd Direct earnings and capital exposure The Group has direct exposure to the following risks in respect of financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet: Market risk the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
Credit risk the risk of financial loss if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations in respect of financial instruments held by the Group.
Credit risk includes investment credit risk, counterparty risks, deposit and loan risks and country risks.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the failure of the Group to maintain adequate levels of financial resources to enable it to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Group could be required to pay its liabilities earlier than expected or because of any inability to realise assets in order to meet obligations as they fall due or is only able to realise assets by suffering financial loss.
A fuller analysis of the financial risks associated with the Group's financial instruments, together with the objectives, policies and processes to manage the Group's exposure follows.
Unit-linked assets and liabilities A significant element of the value of the Group's financial assets relates to the Group's unit-linked pooled pension business.
As outlined in note 19, Financial Instruments, the risks and rewards associated with these assets, which are held by the Group's insurance subsidiary, fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, the underlying policyholders.
As a result, the investment contract liabilities reflected on the Group Balance Sheet are equal and opposite in value to the assets which are held on behalf of unitlinked policyholders.
The Group has no direct exposure to fluctuations in the value of the assets arising from changes in market prices or credit default, although the revenue stream earned from managing these assets varies in line with the movement in assets held on behalf of clients.
The financial risk management disclosures specifically exclude policyholders' unit-linked assets and liabilities relating to F&C Managed Pension Funds Limited as there is no direct exposure to the Group from the associated financial instruments.
Financial investments Recognising that the Group's revenue stream has significant financial exposure to fluctuations in assets managed on behalf of clients, a key principle of the Group Treasury Policy set by the Board is to restrict investment of the Group's assets to low risk deposits or money market instruments where the risk of capital loss is low, thereby seeking to protect the Group's capital.
Advanced Board approval is required for any investment or financial instrument which does not follow this general principle.
In November 2007 the Board amended the Group Treasury Policy to allow up to 20.0m of the Group's cash resources to be utilised as seed capital to support the launch of new investment funds.
The policy permits seed capital to be invested in a maximum of two funds at any point in time, restricts the maximum initial investment to 10.0m in any one fund and targets divestment of seed capital no later than 12 months from the date of investment.
While no such investments were held at either balance sheet date, investments totalling 14.8m were made in 2008 to facilitate the launch of new single strategy hedge funds.
The Group subsequently realised a gain of 5.3m on disposal of these investments.
Forward exchange contracts were also entered into with a view to minimising any financial loss arising from exposure to currency risk on these initial investments.
'Financial investments' classified as fair value through profit or loss, detailed on pages 94 to 96, primarily comprise assets held in connection with current or historic employee remuneration arrangements.
The Group has no net financial exposure to 'Purchased Equity Plan' and 'Bonus investments' as the risks and rewards of all movements in the value of these financial assets fall to the beneficiary and are offset by equal and opposite movements in the Group's associated employee benefit liabilities, which accrue over the vesting period.
The 'NIC hedge' economically hedges the Group's exposure to movements in future National Insurance Contributions obligations in respect of certain assets held by the Group's Employee Benefit Trusts.
'Other financial investments' classified as available for sale reflect the value of the Group's private equity investments.
These primarily reflect 'carried interest entitlement' which arises from the Group's historical ownership of private equity businesses.
The Board does not seek to manage any of the financial risks associated with these investments and recognises that uncertainty exists as to the quantum and timing of future distributions which may arise from these investments.
131 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 38.
Financial risk management contd Stock of units and shares The Group operates and manages a number of Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs whose funds, into which retail and institutional investors can invest, have a wide range of investment objectives.
The Group holds a stock of units and shares in these OEIC funds in order to facilitate the creation and redemption of units by investors.
The Group's risk management policy specifically limits the overall magnitude of the units held by the Group to 1.5m and the amount which may be held in any single fund to 0.05m.
Trade debtors and accrued income Trade debtors and accrued income represent amounts recognised within net revenue in the Income Statement, but which have not been settled in cash.
The nature of F&C's business is such that asset management fees accrue based on daily, month-end or quarter-end asset values, which once known, are billed to clients and are due to be settled in line with individual contractual terms.
As a result, the aggregate value of debtors and accrued income can typically represent up to four months of revenue at any point in time.
In addition, as most of the performance fees earned by the Group accrue in respect of the calendar year and can only be billed subsequently, the quantum of accrued income at the balance sheet date is generally higher than at other periods and is sensitive to the magnitude of performance fees recognised.
"Before the Group takes on new clients, it undertakes the required ""Know Your Client"" procedures."
As the Group manages assets on behalf of clients and management fees are typically charged to and paid from the underlying funds managed by the Group, there is a relatively low risk of default on management fees.
The Group does not hold any credit insurance.
Due to the scale of some of F&C's larger clients, the Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk from large clients or groups of connected clients, arising from timing difference between the recognition of income and the receipt of management fees outlined above.
Very few clients have external credit ratings.
Where management fees are denominated in a currency other than Sterling, the Group is exposed to currency risk.
As previously noted, prior to 2008 the Group did not hedge any of its exposure to monetary assets denominated in foreign currency.
However, during 2008 the Group partially hedged its anticipated Euro-denominated revenue streams in respect of 2008 and 2009.
Other debtors Other debtors include 'Trustee debtors' and 'debtors due from investors in respect of the purchase of units'.
In operating and managing OEICs, the Group seeks to match the purchase and sale of investments to align to the receipt or payment of funds from or to investors.
However, if these obligations are not matched then there is a requirement for the Group to fund any short fall from its corporate cash resources.
The risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the short settlement period involved.
In the event that investors default on sums due, then the Group is entitled to reimbursement of costs from the investor.
Cash and cash equivalents F&C adopts a low risk approach to treasury management and seeks to ensure that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed appropriately.
The Group treasury operations are managed by the Finance function within parameters defined by the Board.
The regulatory capital and treasury position of the Group are reported to the Board on a regular basis.
The Group's cash and cash equivalent assets are exposed to a number of financial risks in the normal course of its business.
The policy adopted is designed to manage risk and recognises that treasury management operations are specifically not treated as a profit centre.
The key aspects of this policy and its implementation are detailed below: Funds on deposit will only be placed on a short term basis maximum term 90 days to help maximise regulatory capital.
Deposits may only be placed with counterparties approved by the F&C Credit Committee, and the Board has set a 25.0m limit for the maximum exposure to any single counterparty.
The F&C Credit Committee's primary focus is to assess the credit position of counterparties prior to placing any client assets with them together with the monitoring of credit risk thereafter.
Financial risk management contd Exposure to cash and cash equivalent balances held in foreign currency is managed to reduce the risk of movements in exchange rates, where possible, by the repatriation of surplus foreign currency into Sterling.
This is achieved in practice via the regular settlement of the Group's transfer pricing arrangements and through the payment of dividends from foreign subsidiaries, having regard to their respective, legal, regulatory and working capital requirements.
The timing of the conversion of Euro-denominated cash balances to Sterling is by necessity impacted by the settlement profile of the forward currency contracts.
Cash and deposit balances can be exposed to interest rate movements.
The Group utilises the experience and skills of its professional dealing team to obtain the best interest rates, ensuring the expected maturity dates of deposits are aligned to the Group's working capital requirements.
Recognising the scale and significance of the world financial crisis which arose during 2008, management determined it appropriate to temporarily reduce the Groups maximum corporate exposure to any one financial institution to 15.0m, from the Board approved level of 25.0m.
In such an environment, the objective of capital preservation was considered of greater importance than the income generated from short-term deposits.
Reinsurance assets The Group unit-linked pooled pension subsidiary is an insurance company and has some exposure to insurance contract liabilities, as outlined in note 32.
These liabilities are fully reinsured as the Group seeks to have no net insurance exposure.
The reinsurance assets represent the expected amounts recoverable to meet insurance liabilities as they fall due.
The Group has exposure to both credit and liquidity risk on these assets.
Defined benefit pension deficit The Group's defined benefit pension obligation represents the discounted value of future pension obligations in excess of plan assets, details of which are given in note 27.
The Group has exposure to the movements in the market value of the plan assets, which include equities and LDI fixed interest pools.
Approximately 25% of the assets held in respect of the UK scheme are held in LDI pools, with maturity profiles which match the expected maturity profile of pension obligations.
The market values of the LDI pools are impacted by movements in interest rates.
The value of defined benefit pension obligations is quantified and discounted using corporate bond rates.
Movements in these rates can have a significant impact on the pension liabilities and hence the quantum of the Group's pension deficit.
Management of capital While F&C considers its capital to be its total equity, this is effectively managed via the net assets to which it relates.
The Company's Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Board monitors significant movements in the composition of its shareholder base.
Details of substantial interests in share capital are shown on page 31.
In the ordinary course of business the only movements in the absolute number of shares in issue would be through the issue of new or own shares to satisfy obligations under share-based payment arrangements or through the purchase of own shares to satisfy future share scheme obligations.
The Directors give careful consideration to the appropriate funding structure for financing all acquisitions, which historically have included both equity and debt funded transactions.
Dividends are only declared by the Board after due consideration of a number of key items, including the financial results and the future outlook of the financial position of the Company and of the Group.
In 2007 the Directors rebased the dividend to achieve the targeted dividend cover of 1.5 times underlying profit.
The Board declared an unchanged total dividend of 6.0p per share for 2008.
As a result of the impact of extreme market conditions and corporate uncertainty, this resulted in a 2008 dividend cover of less than the 150% target.
The overall objective of shareholder liquidity risk management is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity over short and medium time horizons to meet the needs of the business.
This includes liquidity to cover, among other things, capital expenditure, servicing debt and equity capital as well as working capital to fund the Group's day-to-day requirements.
The only security held over the Group's assets is in respect of the 35.0m Floating Rate Secured Notes which were issued during 2008 to partially finance the acquisition of REIT.

Financial risk management contd Working capital Working capital is monitored on a daily basis to ensure that settlement terms of all forthcoming liabilities can be met.
This activity includes timely collection of debtors and monitoring of cash on deposit, having regard to regulatory capital requirements, as outlined below.
The Group's Finance function includes a Treasury team which manages the short-term cashflow requirements of the Group are met while seeking to maximise the amount of cash on deposit.
The Group also has bank overdraft facilities available to it which provide some protection against any short-term cash-flow requirements.
The undrawn committed facilities available at the balance sheet date are shown in note 24.
In 2006 the Group issued 260.0m fixed rate Subordinated Notes for which the earliest repayment date is 2016, but this can be extended at the option of the Group until 2026.
The Group has the option to defer interest payments on this debt, but if it elects to do so then no dividend can be paid to Ordinary Shareholders until the cumulative amount of any unpaid interest due on the debt is settled in full.
No such interest payments have been deferred.
As highlighted above, the Group issued 35.0m of debt during 2008 to partially finance the REIT acquisition.
This debt is required to be paid in full by 30 June 2010.
The Group will continue to monitor options available to repay this debt recognising that market conditions may impact any refinancing alternatives.
Details of the Group's interest bearing loans and borrowings are given in note 24.
The Board Reserved List prohibits the use of derivatives including futures, options and forward contracts, in respect of the Group's net assets, without prior Board approval, recognising the general principle of seeking to minimise capital loss.
In 2008, the Board specifically approved a series of Euro-denominated forward currency contracts which sought to partially hedge future revenues of the Group.
Regulatory capital requirements The Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital in accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD prescribed in the UK by the Financial Services Authority FSA.
In 2006, the Group obtained from the FSA a waiver from meeting any minimum capital requirements under the consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
This waiver took effect from 1 January 2007 and does not need to be renewed until 2011.
At 31 December 2008, there were 15 regulated companies in the Group, of which 11 are registered in the United Kingdom and are subject to regulation by the FSA.
This includes F&C Managed Pension Funds Limited which, being a regulated insurance firm, as opposed to a regulated investment firm, is not part of F&C's consolidation group for regulatory capital reporting purposes but is part of the Friends Provident regulatory group.
Overseas regulated companies, registered in the Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands, Portugal and Hong Kong are subject to regulatory capital requirements set out by their local regulatory authority as embedded within the legislation of those jurisdictions.
Regulatory rules set out the measurement of Capital Resources and Capital Resources Requirements CRR to determine the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
This CRR is referred to as the Pillar 1 capital requirements under CRD.
For the UK regulated investment firms: the CRR is the higher of: The sum of the 'credit risk capital requirement' and the 'market risk capital requirement': and the 'fixed overhead requirement'.
Credit risk represents the risk of a party being unable to meet its obligations to a firm, calculated using risk weighted percentages applied to the various exposure amounts.
The market risk for F&C represents the risk of loss from fluctuations in exchange rates, calculated as a percentage of the total of the long or short positions, denominated in foreign currencies, whichever is the greater.
The fixed overheads requirement is calculated as a quarter of a firm's relevant fixed annual expenditure in the previous year's audited Financial Statements.
Financial risk management contd The regulated companies are required to submit financial returns to the FSA, or the local regulatory authority for overseas companies, setting out the calculation of the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
The Group's regulated companies are required to submit returns quarterly or semi-annually and the Group must submit a consolidated return semi-annually.
The CRD requires the Group to conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, referred to as Pillar 2 capital requirements.
The objective of this process is to ensure that companies have adequate capital to enable them to manage risks not deemed to be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 minimum requirements.
This is a forward looking exercise which includes stress testing on major risks, considering how each company would cope with a significant market down turn for example, and an assessment of the companies and Group's ability to mitigate the risks.
All of the Group's regulated entities maintained surpluses of regulatory capital throughout 2007 and 2008.
The extent of risks arising from financial instruments Note 38 presents details of the Groups direct or indirect exposure to financial risks arising from financial instruments and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Groups capital.
This note provides numerical analysis of the Groups direct exposure to such financial risk, including relevant sensitivity analysis, at each balance sheet date.
The disclosures in this note exclude any policyholder unit-linked assets and liabilities in respect of the Groups insurance subsidiary, as the risks and rewards rest primarily with the policyholders.

The maximum exposure of each class of financial asset is: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 m m Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Financial investments 8.2 8.6 Stock of units and shares 0.3 0.8 Available for sale financial assets: Financial investments 2.1 3.8 Loans and receivables: Trade debtors 9.5 11.0 Accrued income 35.0 45.3 Other debtors 27.7 25.6 Amounts owed by Friends Provident Group 0.4 1.5 Amounts owned by F&C REIT related party entities 0.9 Amounts owed by Eureko Group 4.8 6.5 Cash and cash equivalents shareholders 223.1 216.2 312.0 319.3 The accrued income balance is higher than the average monthly balance during the year.
This is primarily due to the level of performance fees recognised at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.

This analysis measures the change in fair value and cash flows of the Groups financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis, which is for illustrative purposes only, is prepared based on financial instruments that are recognised at the balance sheet dates.
The sensitivity assumes changes in certain market conditions.
These assumptions may differ materially from the actual outturn due to the inherent uncertainties in global financial markets.
In practice, market risks rarely change in isolation and are likely to be interdependent.
The methods and assumptions used are the same for both reporting periods.
The extent of risks arising from financial instruments contd v Sensitivity analysis contd The sensitivity analysis has been prepared based on the impact a set percentage increase or decrease in the market conditions would have on the profit or loss and on total equity.
Changes in exchange rates assume an instantaneous increase or decrease of 10.0% for foreign currency to Sterling rates at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes in fair values of investments assume a 10.0% increase or decrease in the fair values of investments at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant.
Changes in market interest rates assume an increase or decrease of 1.0% in the rate applied to average cash balances in the year.
The financial impact of market risk sensitivities, after taxation, are summarised below: Profit or loss Profit or loss Equity Equity sensitivity sensitivity sensitivity sensitivity As at 31 December 2008 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% 10% 10% 10% Currency Sterling Euro exchange rates 8.0 9.8 18.4 18.3 Sterling USD exchange rates 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Fair value movement Investments 10% 10% 10% 10% Sterling equity prices 0.4 0.4 0.6 0.6 Interest rate movement 1% 1% 1% 1% Sterling market interest rates 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 As at 31 December 2007 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling Euro exchange rates 1.0 1.2 7.0 8.5 Sterling USD exchange rates 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.3 Fair value movement Investments 10% -10% 10% -10% Sterling equity prices 0.6 0.6 0.9 0.9 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 Represents a 10% movement in favour of the Group and 10% movement against the Group.
The increase in the sensitivity to changes in the Sterling Euro exchange rate from 31 December 2007 to 31 December 2008 is primarily attributable to the forward currency contracts which were entered into during 2008.
In addition, the F&C REIT put options are disclosed at fair value.
A 10% movement in the fair value of the options at 31 December 2008 would result in a 6.6m 31 December 2007: nil charge or credit to the Income Statement and to equity.
Impairment of financial assets can also be affected by changes in the relevant underlying risk.

Insurance risk management The Groups insurance contracts are all annuity contracts which guarantee payment during the lifetime of the annuitant at a specified level or with a specified escalation factor.
They are all 100% reinsured with Friends Provident Pensions Limited.
The only risk that the Group is subject to in respect of these contracts is the credit risk of the reinsurer.
Given the small amount at risk 2.1m at 31 December 2008: 2.3m at 31 December 2007 this is not considered significant.
