Post-retirement benefits Introduction and background to IAS 19 International Accounting Standard 19 Employee Benefits requires the Group to include in the balance sheet the surplus or deficit on defined benefit schemes calculated as at the balance sheet date.
It is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit is, therefore, dependent on factors which are beyond the control of the Group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries.
The QinetiQ Pension Scheme In the UK the Group operates the QinetiQ Pension Scheme for the majority of its UK employees, a mixed benefit scheme.
The Defined Benefit DB section of the scheme provides future service pension benefits to transferring Civil Service employees.
All Group employees who were members, or eligible to be members, of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme or the UKAEA principal Non-Industrial Superannuation Scheme were invited to join the DB section of the scheme from 1 July 2001, together with all new employees who were previously members of schemes who are part of the Public Sector Transfer Club.
The Group has given notice to withdraw from the Public Sector Transfer Club from 31 March 2009.
The Defined Contribution DC section of the scheme was set up for employees who were not eligible or did not wish to join the DB section of the scheme.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the DB section was undertaken as at 31 March 2005 and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of 106.5m.
On the basis of this full valuation the Trustees of the scheme and the Company agreed that the 17.5% employer contribution rate would continue.
The Company paid 90.3m into the scheme on 30 March 2006 and there were no additional employer contributions in the year to 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2008.
Other UK schemes In the UK the Group operates a further two small defined benefit schemes, QinetiQ Prudential Platinum Scheme and a scheme for the subsidiary company ASAP Calibration Limited.
The net pension deficits of these schemes at 31 March 2008 amounted to 0.2m 31 March 2007: 0.3m.
The defined benefit scheme relating to ASAP Calibration Limited was closed to future benefit accruals in the year to 31 March 2007.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at the balance sheet date March 2007: nil.
Set out below is a summary of the overall IAS 19 defined benefit pension schemes liabilities.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods, and thus inherently uncertain, were: all figures in million 2008 2007 2006 2005 Equities 620.8 641.5 551.1 361.6 Corporate bonds 83.9 74.5 85.2 44.4 Government bonds 76.3 74.7 74.8 45.7 Cash 3.2 3.4 4.9 2.4 Total market value of assets 784.2 794.1 716.0 454.1 Present value of scheme liabilities 807.6 884.9 884.4 617.2 Net pension liability before deferred tax 23.4 90.8 168.4 163.1 Deferred tax asset 6.5 27.1 50.4 48.8 Net pension liability 16.9 63.7 118.0 114.3 115 salterbaxter 8907 QinetiQ Annual Report Accounts 5 June 2008 account manager cs designer co setting ml PROOF FIVE final............. proofreader final............. a c manager QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 notes to the financial statements continued 39.
Post-retirement benefits continued Assumptions The major assumptions weighted to reflect individual scheme differences were: 2008 2007 Rate of increase in salaries 5.0% 4.6% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.5% 3.1% Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 3.5% 3.1% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 6.6% 5.4% Inflation assumption 3.5% 3.1% Assumed life expectancies in years: Future male pensioners currently aged 60 87 85 Future female pensioners currently aged 60 90 88 Future male pensioners currently aged 40 88 86 Future female pensioners currently aged 40 91 89 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
It is important to note that these assumptions are long term, and in the case of the discount rate and the inflation rate are measured by external market indicators.
In light of evidence of improvements in life expectancy the assumptions for mortality have changed in the year to 31 March 2008 so that the allowance for improvements in life expectancy is in line with the Medium Cohort projections rather than the Short Cohort assumptions used in the prior year.
The Medium Cohort assumptions use the mortality tables PMA92MC for males and PFA92MC for females for the year of birth, with no underpin for the annual improvement beyond Medium Cohort improvements, as published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation and adopted by the actuarial profession.
Scheme assets Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets weighted to reflect individual scheme differences were: 2008 2007 Equities 7.7% 7.7% Corporate bonds 6.2% 5.3% Government bonds 4.4% 4.6% Cash 6.0% 5.5% Weighted average 7.2% 7.2% Return on scheme assets all figures in million 2008 2007 Actual return on plan assets: Expected return on scheme assets 56.8 50.4 Actuarial loss gain on scheme assets 84.0 7.5 Actual loss return on scheme assets 27.2 57.9 Value of scheme assets all figures in million 2008 2007 Changes to the fair value of scheme assets: Opening fair value of scheme assets 794.1 716.0 Expected return on assets 56.8 50.4 Actuarial loss gain 84.0 7.5 Contributions by the employer 32.3 33.4 Curtailment contributions by employer 6.1 Contributions by plan participants 6.5 5.6 Scheme disposal Aurix Limited 1.5 Net benefits paid out and transfers 20.0 24.9 Closing fair value of scheme assets 784.2 794.1 116 salterbaxter 8907 QinetiQ Annual Report Accounts 5 June 2008 account manager cs designer co setting ml PROOF FIVE final............. proofreader final............. a c manager FInAnCIAl sTATEmEnTs QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 notes to the financial statements continued 39.
