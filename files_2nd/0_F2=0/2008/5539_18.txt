Accounting Policies The financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2008 were authorised for issue by the Board on 17 November 2008.
Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited company incorporated and registered in England.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Company has taken advantage of the provisions of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
These accounts are for the Company and are not consolidated financial statements.
Separate consolidated financial statements for the Group are prepared under IFRS and are published separately within this document.
Property, plant and equipment Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords fixtures and fittings and other assets are held at cost.
The Companys licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued each year by professionally qualified external valuers and employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations.
Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken directly to the revaluation reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset which has previously been recognised as an expense in the Income Statement.
Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken directly to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset.
Any further decrease in value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlords fixtures and fittings are held at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The useful economic life of additions to landlords fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis to write off the total cost less residual value over their useful economic life.
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lower of the remaining lease term and their useful economic life of 50 years.
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line basis to residual value.
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment.
Where any indications are identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment.
Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement.
Leases Leases where the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of future minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease payable.
Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are taken as an expense to the Income Statement.

Accounting Policies continued Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement over the lease term.
The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as operating leases are classified in the balance sheet as intangible assets: operating lease premiums within noncurrent assets and are amortised over the lease term.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying value and expected sale proceeds, net of selling costs.
Pubs and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified for disposal by the Company.
They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should be highly probable.
These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year.
Pubs held for sale are not depreciated and operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised.
Investments Fixed asset investments are initally recognised at fair value and then held at this value subject to an annual impairment test.
Current assets held for sale Current assets held for sale comprise tenants fixtures and fittings and are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred on disposal.
Financial instruments i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand.
Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
ii Borrowings Borrowings which include bank borrowings, syndicated debt finance, debentures and secured bonds are measured at amortised cost.
This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings across the life of the instrument.
iii Derivative financial instruments The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and these are classified as derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value on acquisition and are subsequently restated to fair value at each reporting date.
Any change in the fair value of the instruments is recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting has been adopted.
Hedge accounting is only adopted where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation documentation of the hedging relationship and it meets the Companys risk management strategy for undertaking the hedge, and it is expected to be highly effective.
The portion of any change in the fair value of the hedging instrument used in a cash flow hedge which meets the conditions for hedge accounting and is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity.
Changes in fair value relating to any ineffective portions are recognised in the Income Statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in equity are kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
In the case of interest rate swaps, the forecast transaction is the payment of interest.

Accounting Policies continued iv Equity instruments Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in Called up Share Capital and the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in Share Premium.
Net debt Net debt is the total of all financial assets and liabilities less cash.
Underlying net debt is amounts repayable to banks and other lenders, net of cash retained in the business.
Taxation The income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to be settled net or simultaneously.
Both current and deferred tax are recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the corresponding tax is also recognised in equity.
Tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amount of the provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Pension obligations The Company has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees own pension plans is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
The defined benefit scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits.
The net amount recognised in the balance sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the schemes liabilities and the fair value of the schemes assets.
This is determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit.
The net of the expected return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance income or finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Treasury shares The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.

Accounting Policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and VAT.
Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Sales of beverages are recognised when these goods are delivered to our licensees.
Rents receivable are recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 and applied its requirements to those awards granted after 7 November 2002 that were not vested at 1 January 2005.
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees.
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of award and this value is subsequently updated at each balance sheet date for managements best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period by calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income Statement.
A corresponding entry is made to equity.
The fair value of share options is measured using valuation models.
Dividends Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
New standards and interpretations During the year the Company has adopted the capital disclosure requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
A number of new standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
The following standards which are relevant to the Company are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements, although the amendment to IAS 1 may result in some changes to the presentation of the financial statements.
The effective dates below represent the latest date that the Company will be required to implement the standard: Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs effective from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments effective from 1 January 2009.
IFRIC 14 The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction effective 1 October 2008.
Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements effective 1 October 2009.
Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements effective 1 October 2009.
Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations effective 1 July 2009.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations effective 1 September 2009.
Amendment to IAS 39 Eligible Hedged Items effective 1 July 2009.
Use of accounting estimates and judgements The Company makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below: 86 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008 15809 04 12 2008 Proof 6 158  4 12 08 16:08 Page 87 Notes to the Company Accounts at 30 September 2008 1.
Accounting Policies continued a Property, Plant and Equipment Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
The valuation is based on market observations and estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing.
Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value and their market value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub.
Further information about the valuation of the pub estate is provided in note 4 of these accounts.
The Company estimates the useful economic life and residual value of property, plant and equipment PPE and these estimates influence the depreciation charged each year.
For details of these estimates, see the detailed accounting policy for PPE.
b Valuation of interest rate swaps The Company measures interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The swap valuation rates are derived from the mid point of the zero coupon prevailing at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract rate and the valuation rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry date.
The calculation therefore uses estimates of present values and future interest rates.
c Taxation Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained.
Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a liability will arise.
The Company reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
d Other The Group also makes estimations and judgements in the valuation of share-based payments and the pension liability.
However, the value of these items is such that any variation in the estimates used is unlikely to have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Share buy-backs in close period In accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation a financial liability has been recognised when the Company enters into a contingent agreement with a third party which require the Company to purchase shares during the close period.
No contingent agreement had been entered into by the Company at 30 September 2008.
Presentation of interest rate swaps The 2007 balance sheet has been adjusted in respect of the presentation of interest rate swap fair values.
An amendment to IAS 1 requires financial liabilities not held for trading to be presented as current or non-current on the basis of settlement date.
Previously, all interest rate swaps that were not designated as part of an effective hedging relationship were presented as current liabilities.
This has resulted in a reduction in current liabilities of 11 million with a corresponding increase in non-current liabilities.

Property, plant and equipment continued Revaluation of property, plant and equipment With the exception of properties identified for disposal the Companys licensed land and buildings were revalued as at 30 September 2008 by Humberts Leisure Limited, independent Chartered Surveyors and by the internal Head of Estates, Simon Millar MRICS, Chartered Surveyor.
The land and buildings were valued at market value as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards Red Book, reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated by each property capitalised at an appropriate yield.
The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases or tenancies under which the properties are let.
Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location, pub quality and tenure.
The valuations are made with consideration given to market transactions within the UK pub sector.
The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in the Company have been valued by Humberts Leisure Limited.
The balance of the estate held in the Company has been valued by the Head of Estates.
The results of this internal valuation have been compared to those of the external valuers.
This review ensured that the results are consistent.
Pubs identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as non-current assets held for sale are held at fair value less costs to sell.
This value is based on the net estimated realisable disposal proceeds ERV which are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the properties.
If licensed land and buildings had been measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts would be as follows: Licensed land and buildings m At 30 September 2008 Cost 1,996 Accumulated depreciation 35 Net book value 1,961 At 30 September 2007 Cost 1,962 Accumulated depreciation 34 Net book value 1,928 The carrying value of property held under finance leases at 30 September 2008 was 123 million 2007 113 million.
Additions during the year include 2 million of property held under finance leases 2007 4 million.
At 30 September 2008, the Company had entered into contractual commitments to purchase 7 million 2007 20 million of property, plant and equipment.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Fair values Bank borrowings, the debenture, bonds and interest rate swaps were valued at fair value as at 30 September by J C Rathbone, independent valuers.
Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rates.
The finance lease payables are valued by calculating the present value of the future minimum lease payments.
The book and fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been analysed into categories as below: 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 Nominal Book Fair Nominal Book Fair value value value value value value Interest rate m m m m m m Overdraft 6.75% 10 10 10 Syndicated bank borrowings LIBOR 0.8% 1,000 998 1,000 1,000 997 1,000 Unsecured bank facility LIBOR 0.9% 35 35 35 Corporate bonds: Debenture issued 3 February 1999 6% 60 59 54 60 59 60 Secured bond issued 9 May 2000 6.875% 125 124 124 125 124 136 Secured bond issued 15 February 2001 6.875% 125 124 125 125 124 134 Secured bond issued 26 February 2002 6.375% 275 272 191 275 272 291 Secured bond issued 3 March 2003 6.5% 600 602 467 600 602 614 1,185 1,181 961 1,185 1,181 1,235 Interest rate swaps: 275m swap expiring 1 June 2012 6.662% 13 13 12 12 350m swap expiring 30 September 2011 4.887% 3 3 8 8 10 10 4 4 2,185 2,189 1,971 2,230 2,227 2,284 Provision for close period share buy-back contracts 21 21 Finance lease payables note 11 2 2 2 2 Intercompany: Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings 107 107 87 87 Amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings 49 49 19 19 Total debt 2,185 2,133 1,915 2,230 2,182 2,239 Cash 14 14 6 6 Underlying net debt net debt 2,171 2,119 2,224 2,176 Bank borrowings, the unsecured bank facility, the corporate bonds and the amounts owed by and to subsidiary undertakings are held at amortised cost.
Interest rate swaps are held at fair value and finance lease payables represents the present value of future minimum lease payments.
The liability for close period share buy-back contracts represents an estimate of the amount that may be incurred on share buy-backs during the period from 1 October to the date of the preliminary announcement of results.
There is no difference between the book value and the fair value of this provision.
Other categories of financial instruments include trade receivables and trade payables.
However, there is no difference between the book value and fair value of these items.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008 93 15809 04 12 2008 Proof 6  4 12 08 16:08 Page 94 Notes to the Company Accounts at 30 September 2008 9.
Financial assets and liabilities continued Interest rate swaps On 29 September 2006 the Company designated the 350 million swap that expires in September 2011 as an effective cash flow hedge under IAS 39.
This cash flow hedge is hedging future movements in interest rates until September 2011.
As a result, changes in the fair value of the effective portion of this swap are recognised directly in equity with changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised in the Income Statement.
Both of the Companys swaps are in place to hedge cash payments made on the floating rate debt.
The movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps has been accounted for as follows: 2008 2007 m m At 1 October 4 20 Fair value movements: ineffective portion and swaps not designated as effective hedges recognised in Income Statement 1 10 effective portion recognised in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve 5 6 At 30 September 10 4 Financial instruments and risk The Companys financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, a debenture, secured bonds and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Companys operations.
The Company also enters into derivative transactions, specifically interest rate swaps and contracts to purchase shares in a close period.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Companys sources of finance and meet the objective of the Companys share buy-back strategy.
In the year to 30 September 2008 the Company repaid and cancelled 35 million of a 100 million uncommitted, unsecured bank facility with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
There is no currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised as follows.
Liquidity risk The Company has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due.
The Companys objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, bank loans and debentures.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Interest rate risk The Company borrows its debenture and bonds at a fixed rate.
Bank debt is borrowed at, and cash balances attract interest at, a floating rate.
The Companys objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
This exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates and using interest rate swaps acquired by Group companies.
At 30 September 2008, the Companys borrowings were 83% fixed after including the impact of interest rate swaps with an average interest rate of 6.5% for nine years 2007 82% fixed at an average rate of 6.5% for ten years.
Cash flows associated with cash deposits, debt and interest rate swaps and the fair value of these instruments fluctuates with changes in interest rates.
The effect on the profit for the year would have been as follows if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower during the period.
Movement in fair value Interest Interest of interest receivable payable rate swap m m m As reported in Income Statement 21 147 1 Effect if interest rates increased by 50 basis points 0.5% 23 149 4 Difference 2 2 5 As reported in Income Statement 21 147 1 Effect if interest rates decreased by 50 basis points 0.5% 19 145 7 Difference 2 2 6 Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Company.
The Company is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances.
The Companys objective is to minimise this risk by dealing with third parties with high credit ratings and carrying out credit checks where appropriate.
The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet is net of a bad debt provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
At 30 September 2008 the value of collateral is 25 million 2007 24 million.
This balance is held on the balance sheet in other payables.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.
This provision relates to trade receivables which are primarily owed by licensees.
2008 2007 m m Provision as at 1 October 1 3 Increase in provision during the year 2 2 Provision utilised during the year 1 Provision released during the year 1 3 Provision as at 30 September 2 1 There are no trade receivables that are past due at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against.
There are no indications as at 30 September 2008 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are neither past due nor impaired.
The maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables and the fair value of interest rate swaps classified as financial assets.
The Companys credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the Company only invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.
