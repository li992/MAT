The reduction of 17.8% is mainly due to the impact of the reduction in the rate of corporation tax used to calculate deferred tax offset by a reduction in the level of adjustments in respect of prior years.
d Unrecognised tax losses The Group has tax losses of 8.7 million 2007: 9.1 million which have arisen in its Gibraltar subsidiary for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group and it is not expected that the subsidiary will utilise significant amounts in the foreseeable future.
The losses are, however, available for offset against future taxable profits without time limit.
e Temporary differences associated with Group investments At 31 March 2008, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2007: nil for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries as the Group has determined that undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The temporary difference associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to 8.5 million 2007: 7.2 million.

The annual excess has been falling mainly because, since 1 April 2005, tax deductions for deferred revenue expenditure are claimed on a depreciation basis as originally set out in HM Revenue and Customs Tax Bulletin 53.
