Share-based payment The Directors Remuneration Report describes the feature of the new long-term incentive scheme implemented by the Company in 2006.
The scheme includes an element payable in shares, which has resulted in expenses during the year of 4.6m 2007 8.5m.
In accordance with the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based payment, the Company has presented the liability payable with shares resulting from the recognition of those expenses as a bonus reserve within equity.
The scheme will result in the grant of shares, some of which will attract matching shares if the Companys performance meets certain conditions in the future.
For each share that attracts matching shares, the scheme allows the Company to grant: Up to one matching share on satisfaction of a market condition test, which compares the Companys growth in total shareholder return to the growth in an index of comparator companies: and Up to one matching share on satisfaction of non-market condition tests, which compare the growth of net asset value per share with that of the UK retail price index The Company may grant proportional numbers of shares on partial satisfaction of the performance conditions.
The Company uses an actuarial model to estimate the number of shares required to match the market condition related shares.
The model looked at the historic out-performance of the group of comparator companies to determine the distribution of probabilities of out-performance and applied a stochastic analysis to determine the expected number of matching shares.
The Company estimated the number of non-market condition related matching shares by comparing the internal and market growth forecasts for net assets per share and the UK retail price index at relevant future balance sheet dates.
The Company bases the fair value of all the matching shares on estimated market values at the date of grant.
