Borrowing facilities The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The undrawn borrowing facilities comprise revolving credit facilities that expire between two and five years where interest costs are fixed at the time drawings are made.
During 2008, the Group had an overdraft facility expiring within one year, carrying floating rate interest.
31 Dec 31 Dec 2008 2007 000s 000s Expiring in more than 2 years but not more than 5 years 48,536 20,602 Interest rate sensitivity The Group considers the volatility of interest rates over the year to be representative of the potential interest rate risk it is exposed to.
Over 2008, the weighted average interest rates the Group pays have reduced by 2.4%.
A 2.4% increase in interest rates would decrease Group profit by 1,040,000.
Since base rates are unlikely to reduce to less than 0% the Group does not consider a movement of more than minus 0.5% possible.
If this had occurred, it would increase Group profit by 215,000.
