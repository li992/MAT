The 2008 impairment loss relates to the Chinguetti field in Mauritania and the Chachar field in Pakistan 2007: Chinguetti field in Mauritania.
The recoverable amount of the Chinguetti field in Mauritania was determined by estimating its value in use.
In calculating this impairment, management used a production profile based on proven and probable reserves estimates and a range of assumptions, including an oil price assumption equal to the forward curve in 2009 and 2010 and $80 per barrel thereafter and a 12.5% pre-tax discount rate.
The recoverable amount of the Chachar field in Pakistan was determined by reference to its disposal value less costs to sell.
Depletion and amortisation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus production in the period, generally on a field-by-field basis.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a Group reserves report produced by an independent engineer.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.
