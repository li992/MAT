iv Corporate tax payable The current corporate tax liability of 685 million 2007 673 million represents the amount of taxes payable in respect of current and prior periods that exceed payments made, and includes any interest and penalties payable thereon.
v Material tax liabilities In the past, the group has undergone significant restructuring involving the acquisition and disposal of material businesses and the transfer of businesses intra group.
As a consequence of this restructuring activity, a number of potential tax exposures have arisen.
In addition, as the group operates throughout the world, it faces a number of potential transfer pricing issues in many jurisdictions relating to goods, services and financing.
The issues are often complex, inter-related and can take many years to resolve.
The group has a liability after applicable reliefs of 386 million 2007 377 million for these exposures, which is included in corporate tax payable in current liabilities.
The increase is due to changes to estimates in relation to existing audits and identification of new exposures.
The group has a number of tax audits ongoing worldwide but does not currently expect material additional tax exposures to arise, above the amounts provided, as and when audits are concluded.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of cash flows relating to these items.
Provision is also made for penalties and interest on tax liabilities, and these are included in corporate tax payable in current liabilities and in the corporation tax charge.
9 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In the year ended 30 June 2008, profit after tax in respect of discontinued operations was 26 million.
This principally arose from a tax credit of 24 million relating to the past disposal of the Pillsbury business.
In the year ended 30 June 2007, a tax benefit of 82 million arose from the recognition of capital losses arising on the past disposals of the Pillsbury and Burger King businesses.
In addition, a tax credit of 57 million arose following resolution with tax authorities of various audit issues.
