Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Financial Statements.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments together with their carrying values are as follows: Cash and overdrafts held on the balance sheet at amortised costs.
Fair value approximates to carrying value.
Loans due within one year and after more than one year the fair value of fixed rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets.
The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value.
For loans designated as other items at fair value, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each balance sheet date.
All other loans are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments consists of interest rate swaps included in designated as fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition or as a fair value hedge, forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts included in derivatives and other items at fair value.
Interest rate swaps the fair value is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques based on rates current at year end.
Forward foreign exchange contracts the majority of contracts for existing transactions had maturity of six months or less from year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end.
Foreign currency option contracts the fair value of option contracts is estimated using Black-Scholes valuation techniques.

The fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
For unlisted investments, carrying values approximate fair value.
Other financial assets and other financial liabilities held on the balance sheet at amortised costs with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value.

In the case of non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
Foreign currency risk Translational During the year there has been a significant movement in exchange rates for the Groups principal six currency exposures: sterling GBP, Swedish krona SEK, euro EUR, Australian dollar AUD, Japanese yen JPY and Canadian dollar CAD.
The weakness of our cost currencies sterling and Swedish krona relative to euro which is our main non-US dollars income currency has resulted in a net benefit for the Group.
No hedges were outstanding as at 31 December 2008.
Transactional 100% of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies reporting currency.

The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2008, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2008, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $38m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2008, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.
Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the table below.
