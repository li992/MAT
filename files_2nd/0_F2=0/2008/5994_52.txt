Dened benefit schemes The principal UK scheme the Findel Group Pension Fund was assessed by Aon Consulting, the schemes actuaries, at 6 April 2007 using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in that valuation were that the annual rate of return on growth investments would be 1.50% higher than the annual increase in total pensionable remuneration and the return on bond investments would be between 2.05% and 2.25% higher than the annual increase in present and future pensions in payment.
The actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 91% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable remuneration.
The market value of the schemes assets at the date of valuation was 66.8m.
The next valuation is due as at April 2010.
In addition, the company sponsors the Findel Education Pension Scheme, which was assessed by Aon Consulting, the schemes actuaries, at 6 April 2004.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in that valuation were that the annual rate of return on investments would be between 0.50% and 3% higher than the annual increase in total pensionable remuneration and between 2% and 4.5% higher than the annual increase in present and future pensions in payment.
The actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 71% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable remuneration.
The market value of the schemes assets at the date of valuation was 11.4m.
The next valuation is due in respect of April 2007, but is not yet completed.
The most recent valuations of the plans for IAS 19 purposes were carried out at 31 March 2008 by AON consulting.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the IAS 19 actuarial valuations were as follows: 2008 2007 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 6.70 5.40 Expected return on scheme assets 6.80 6.50 Ination 3.50 3.00 Rate of general increase in salaries 5.25 4.75 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.50 3.00 Rate of increase to deferred pensions 3.50 3.00 The assumption used for post-retirement mortality is equivalent to a life expectancy for a sample male aged 65 retiring in April 2008 of 87.0 years 2007: 84.3 years FGPF and 84.8 years 2007: 83.4 years FEPS : and for a sample male retiring in April 2028 of 88.1 years 2007: 83.7 years FGPF and 86.1 years 2007: 83.4 years FEPS.
