Management believes that the Groups weighted average cost of capital is an appropriate measure as there is no funding .
a Impairment review of intangible assets with indefinite lives As stated in the accounting policies note sections K and L assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
The Group classifies goodwill, casino licences and Spanish bingo licences as indefinite life assets.
i Goodwill The Group has goodwill with a carrying value of 53.8m in respect of the acquisition of Rank Interactive 2007: 53.8m.
As at  exceeded the carrying value of goodwill.
The whole of Rank Interactive is treated as a single cash-generating unit CGU and is tested for impairment on that basis.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on  Groups Business Plan which was also approved by the board.
A 2% growth rate was applied thereafter.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are: settled stakes: gross win margins: and discount rate.
Settled stakes are based on monies placed by customers for the sportsbook and gaming businesses.
Management takes into account the product mix, major sporting events and industry developments when determining settled stakes.
Gross win margins are based on values achieved in the past and amended for any anticipated changes in the budget period.
There are possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of Rank Interactive to exceed its recoverable amount.
These are: settled stakes may be affected by a decrease in customers, a decrease in marketing spend, a change in technology, competition or regulatory changes: and , .
Changes in either key assumption impacts gross win, which is calculated by applying the win margin to stakes placed.
If gross win were to decrease by in excess of 20% each year the value in use would equal the carrying value of the CGU.
ii Casinolicences The inherent value of casino licences is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of the operation of casinos as a whole and is therefore not split out from total casino assets in an impairment review.
The cost of casino licences as at 31 December 2008 was 97.1m 2007: 92.2m and management does not believe that there is any impairment.
Value inusehasbeen calculated using cash flow  .
Along-term growth rate of 2% was applied thereafter.
Casino licences are generally not impaired as they have an indefinite life and a fair market value in excess of their carrying value.
Estimates of the fair value less costs to sell are performed internally by experienced senior management supported by knowledge of similar transactions or where applicable offers received.
The calculation of the value in use of a casino licence is most sensitive tothe following assumptions: admissions: spend per visit: rate of casino duty: competition: and discount rate.

This has been determined by historic trends.
Thebandsandrates have been assumed to remain at current levels without indexation.
These are: competition from licences granted under the Gambling Act 2005 and 1968 Gaming Act which could vary depending upon the number and location of new casinos as well as the date of opening: admission levels could vary as a result of general economic conditions: and , .
iii Spanishbingolicences  therefore split out from Spanish bingo assets in an impairment review.
The cost of Spanish bingo licences as at 31 December 2008 was22.9m 2007:23.7m.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the board for the next financial year along with projections for the following two years based on the Groups BusinessPlan  .
The calculation of the value in use of a bingo licence is most sensitive to the following assumptions: admissions: spend per visit: competition: and discount rate.
Admissions are the number of discrete visits to the bingo club and have been based on recent trends.
Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money net of winnings spent by a member on bingo games, machines and food and beverages.
This has been determined by recent trends.
These are: admission levels could vary as a result of changes in economic conditions in Spain and promotional activity undertaken: spend per visit could be impacted by the economic climate and changes in gaming legislation: and competition could be impacted by the possible closure of competing clubs as well as new openings, although this is less likely in the current climate.
As set out below and in notes 4 and 11, impairments have been booked against bingo licences in the current year.
Any material change to the assumptions could lead to further impairments depending upon which bingo club is affected.
A 10% reduction in income across all clubs would lead to an additional impairment of less than 1.0m.

RankInteractive In 2008 an impairment charge of 1.4m has been recognised in respect of certain software development assets which are no longer expected to generate any material economic benefit or have any resale value.
2007 MeccaBingo In 2007 an impairment charge of 25.7m was recognised in respect of a number of clubs where the estimated cash flows associated with those clubs were less than the carrying value of the property, plant a nd equipment.
The impact from the smoking bans in the UK and the loss of Section 21 gaming terminals was more severe than management had anticipated.
As a consequence, in certain clubs it was also necessary to make onerous lease provisions amounting to 19.1m.

Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on profit and loss of a defined interest rate shift.
For each simulation, the same interest rate shift is used for all currencies.
, the impact on profit or loss of a 120 basis-point shift would be a maximum increase of 4.8m 2007: 1.7m or decrease of 4.8m 2007: 1.7m, respectively.

Generally, theGroupraises  fixed rates directly.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals primarily half yearly, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calcu lated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
Occasionally the Group also enters into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising where it has borrowed at fixed rates in excess of the 60% target.
b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures on outstanding receivables.
The Group only deals with banks and financial institutions with which they have a lending or advisory relationship.
An internal rating is then allocated and an individual credit limit is set in accordance with policy set by the board.
Management reviews the utilisation of credit limits on a regular basis.
In 2008 the Group reduced the credit limit of each of its counterparties and where necessary nil limits were introduced.
The Group predominantly uses AAA rated Money Market Funds when investing its surplus cash.
The rating and portfolio of each fund is reviewed on at least a weekly basis.
In addition to investing the Groups cash with Money Market Funds the Group invests with lending banks when appropriate.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from non-performance of its counterparties.

The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market .
Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of quoted borrowings is based on year-end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair values of other borrowings and the derivative financial instruments are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year-end.

As such, this is based on historical data and does not necessarily indicate future dividend policy.
