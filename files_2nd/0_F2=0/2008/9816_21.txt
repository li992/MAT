The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain items, principally land and buildings, derivative financial instruments and share-based payments.
The Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the complementary amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements Capital disclosures for the 53 weeks ended 4 October 2008, introducing new disclosures, including comparative information, relating to financial instruments.
There is no impact on the current or prior period results and the classification and valuation of the Groups financial instruments are unaffected.
The Group does not consider that any standards or interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a significant impact on the financial statements in the future.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the audited financial statements of Marstons PLC and all of its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of new subsidiary undertakings are included in the Group accounts from the date on which control transferred to the Group or, in the case of disposals, up to the effective date of disposal.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group has applied the purchase method in its accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration paid and deferred, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The consolidated financial statements also incorporate the results of Marstons Issuer PLC, a company set up with the sole purpose of issuing debt secured on assets owned by the Group.
The Directors of Marstons PLC consider this company meets the definition of a special purpose entity under SIC 12 Consolidation special purpose entities and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has been treated as a subsidiary undertaking.
Details of this company are provided in note 34.
Revenue and other operating income Revenue represents the value of goods drink and food and services accommodation and gaming machines supplied to customers, and rents receivable from licensed properties.
Revenue for drink, food and accommodation is recognised at the point at which the goods or services are provided.
Gaming machine income is recognised as earned.
Rental income is recognised in respect of the period to which it relates.
Revenue is recorded net of discounts, intra-Group transactions, VAT, and excise duty relating to the brewing and packaging of certain products.
Other operating income comprises mainly rents receivable from unlicensed properties.
Segmental reporting For primary segment reporting purposes the Group is considered to have four distinguishable business segments, being Marstons Inns and Taverns, Marstons Pub Company, Marstons Beer Company and Marstons Group Services.
This mirrors the Groups internal organisation and management structure, and reflects the different risk profiles to which the business is exposed.
An element of Marstons Group Services costs is allocated to each of the trading divisions.
Acquired businesses are treated as separate reporting segments, where material, until they have been fully integrated with the Groups trading divisions.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency, warrant separate disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets arising on acquisition of subsidiaries are recognised separately from goodwill if the fair value of these assets can be identified separately and measured reliably.

Where the useful life of the asset is considered to be indefinite no annual amortisation is provided but the asset is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Impairment reviews are carried out more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be impaired.
The useful lives of the Groups intangible assets are: Brands Indefinite Lease premiums Life of the lease Computer software 510 years Any impairment of carrying value is charged to the income statement.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised but is instead reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Freehold and leasehold properties are stated at valuation or at cost.
Plant, furnishings, equipment and other similar items are stated at cost.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to provide for the cost of the assets less residual value over their useful lives.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years.
Short leasehold properties are depreciated over the life of the lease.
Other plant and equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years.
Own labour and interest costs directly attributable to capital projects are capitalised.
Valuation of properties Properties are revalued by qualified valuers on a regular basis using open market value so that the carrying value of an asset does not differ significantly from its fair value at the balance sheet date.
When a valuation is below current carrying value, the asset concerned is reviewed for impairment.
Impairment losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain has been recorded, and thereafter to the income statement.
Surpluses on revaluation are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where they reverse previously charged impairment losses, in which case they are recorded in the income statement.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Disposals of property, plant and equipment Profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment represents net sale proceeds less the carrying value of the assets.
Any element of the revaluation reserve relating to the property disposed of is transferred to retained earnings at the date of sale.
Impairment If there are indications of impairment or reversal of impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets, including goodwill.
If there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
The reversal is recognised in the income statement.
The depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying value, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
There is no reversal of impairment losses relating to goodwill.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The cost of the assets held under finance leases is included within property, plant and equipment and depreciation is charged in accordance with the accounting policy for each class of asset concerned.
The corresponding capital obligations under these leases are shown as liabilities.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the income statement and classified within finance costs as incurred.

Similarly, income receivable under operating leases is credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Other non-current assets Other non-current assets represent trade loans.
In common with other major brewers the Group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the Groups beer.
These trade loans are classified as available-for-sale financial assets and are recognised initially at cost.
Subsequently trade loans are measured at fair value, being amounts advanced less deemed impairment.
Significant trade loans are secured against the property of the loan recipient.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued on a first in, first out basis, with the exception of hops which are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work in progress include direct materials and a proportion of attributable overheads.
Assets held for sale Assets, typically properties, are categorised as held for sale when the value of the asset will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than continuing use.
This condition is met when the sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is being actively marketed.
In addition, the Group must be committed to the sale and the completion should be expected to occur within one year from the date of classification.
Assets held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.
Financial assets: available-for-sale investments Cash invested in short-term investment funds for which there are no withdrawal penalties and the maturity dates are in excess of 90 days are treated as financial assets, rather than a cash equivalent, as required by IAS 7 Cash flow statements.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits on call with banks.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial instruments The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available-forsale.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of the Groups financial instruments at initial recognition.
a Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss Derivatives are categorised as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedges.
The Group holds no other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
c Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are presented in the income statement within exceptional finance costs or income in the period in which they arise.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as finance costs.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects which, under the allowed alternative treatment, are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Derivative financial instruments The only derivative financial instruments that the Group enters into are interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within exceptional finance income or costs.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement within exceptional finance income or costs.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and estimated future cash flows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within other operating charges.
When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other operating charges in the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Employee benefits Pension costs for the Groups defined benefit pension scheme are determined by the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial calculations being carried out at each period end date.
Costs are recognised separately as operating and finance costs in the income statement.
Operating costs comprise the current service cost, any income or expenses on settlements or curtailments, and past service costs where the benefits have vested.
Finance items comprise the interest on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets.
Actuarial gains or losses comprising differences between the actual and expected return on scheme assets, changes in scheme liabilities due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet for the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of scheme liabilities less the fair value of scheme assets.
Pension costs for the Groups defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Post-retirement medical benefits are accounted for in an identical way to the Groups defined benefit pension scheme.

In the case of Marstons PLC the only key management personnel are considered to be the Directors of the Group.
Current and deferred tax The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.
Differences are defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Provisions Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
When valuations of leasehold properties based on future estimated income streams give rise to a deficit as a result of onerous lease conditions they are recognised as provisions.
Share-based payments The fair value of share-based remuneration at the date of grant is calculated using the BlackScholes option-pricing model and charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The charge to the income statement takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions contained within IFRS 2 Share-based payments and has only applied this accounting policy to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002.
Awards granted prior to 7 November 2002 are not charged to the income statement.
Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares, shares held within a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and shares held within an Executive Share Option Plan ESOP, which are used for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to equity.
No income or expense is recognised in the performance statements on treasury share transactions.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Transactions and balance sheet items in a foreign currency Transactions in a foreign currency are translated to sterling using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary receivables and payables are remeasured at closing day rates at each balance sheet date.
Exchange gains or losses that arise from such remeasurement and on settlement of the transaction are recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences for non-monetary assets valued at fair value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Gains or losses on disposal of non-monetary assets are recognised in the income statement.
Key assumptions and significant judgements IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Details of the Groups key assumptions and significant judgements are set out in each relevant accounting policy and detailed note to the financial statements.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the weighted average market price of the Companys shares during the period.
Underlying earnings per share figures are presented to exclude the effect of exceptional items.

Recoverable amounts are determined based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 115.2 million 2007: 115.7 million to Marstons Inns and Taverns, 85.4 million 2007: 85.4 million to Marstons Pub Company and 23.3 million 2007: 16.7 million to Marstons Beer Company.
Goodwill has been allocated to business segments based on the extent to which the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The key assumptions used are the pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections of 9.0% 2007: 9.0% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the projected cash flows beyond the one year budgets of 2.0% 2007: 2.0% in line with an expected long-term inflation rate which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
The same pre-tax discount rate has been used for each segment as, in the view of the Directors, the risk profiles are similar.
Other commercial assumptions relate to market growth, market share and net selling prices.
These assumptions are based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
These estimates take account of economic forecasts, marketing plans, political factors and estimates of competitors strategy.
Following the above impairment tests, no impairment of goodwill was required in the current or prior period.

19 SECURITISED DEBT On 9 August 2005, 805.0 million of secured loan notes were issued in connection with the securitisation of 1,592 of the Groups pubs held in Marstons Pubs Limited.
On 22 November 2007, a further 330.0 million of secured loan notes tranches A4 and AB1 were issued in connection with the securitisation of an additional 437 of the Groups pubs, also held in Marstons Pubs Limited.
The loan notes are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Marstons Issuer PLC, a special purpose entity note 34.
During the period ended 4 October 2008, 28 2007: 182 of the securitised pubs were sold to third parties, and 437 2007: 72 pubs were acquired from other members of the Marstons Group.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market, such as over-the-counter derivatives, is determined using valuation techniques.
The Group obtains such valuations from counterparties who use a variety of assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair values of all financial instruments are equal to their book values, with the exception of borrowings note 17.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and trade loans, and the carrying value of trade payables, are assumed to approximate their fair values.
Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
Interest rate risk: The Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates, and as such the Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift.
The scenarios are run only for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
At 4 October 2008, if interest rates had been 1.0% higher lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the period would have been 0.9 million 2007: 2.9 million lower higher as a result of higher lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Generally, the Group raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at fixed rates directly.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals primarily quarterly, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate payable on the floating rate tranches of its securitised debt note 19.
These derivative financial instruments have qualified for cash flow hedge accounting and, as a result, changes in fair value are recognised in equity for the effective portion of the hedge.
The losses taken directly to equity in the period totalled 38.3 million 2007: gains of 15.6 million.

The interest rate swaps fix interest at 4.9% and 5.5% 2007: 4.9%.
On 1 October 2007 the Group entered into two further interest rate swaps of 70.0 million each to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
These derivative financial instruments have not qualified for cash flow hedge accounting and, as a result, changes in fair value are recorded in the income statement.
The losses taken to the income statement in the period totalled 4.2 million 2007: nil note 4.
The notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap contracts at 4 October 2008 totalled 140.0 million.
The interest rate swaps fix interest at 5.5% and 5.6%.
The interest rate risk profile, after taking account of derivative financial instruments, is as follows: 2008 2007 Floating Fixed Floating Fixed rate rate rate rate financial financial financial financial liabilities liabilities Total liabilities liabilities Total m m m m m m Borrowings 107.7 1,237.7 1,345.4 459.8 783.7 1,243.5 The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial borrowings was 5.4% 2007: 5.3% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed was 11 years 2007: 12 years.
Foreign currency risk: The Group buys and sells goods denominated in non-sterling currencies, principally US dollars and Euros.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the value of the Groups income and expenditure.
The Groups exposure in this area is not considered to be significant.
Market risk: The Groups market risk is explained in detail in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 28 to 32.
Counterparty risk: The Groups counterparty risk in respect of its cash and cash equivalents is mitigated by the use of three UK banking institutions for its deposits.
There is no significant concentration of counterparty risk in respect of the Groups pension assets, as these are held with a range of institutions.
Credit risk: Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from credit exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
If customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, an assessment is made of the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual credit limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the Board.
The utilisation of and adherence to credit limits are regularly monitored.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables and free trade loans has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits and fixtures and fittings.
Receivables are written off against the provision for impairment when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of its customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable.
Liquidity risk: Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding though an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve comprising undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flow.
In addition, the Groups liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements, and maintaining debt financing plans.
The Groups borrowing covenants are subject to regular review.

26 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS During the period there were three classes of equity-settled employee share incentive plans outstanding: a Save As You Earn SAYE.
Under this scheme employees enter into a savings contract for a period of three to seven years and options are granted on commencement of the contract, exercisable using the amount saved under the contract at the time it terminates.
Options under the scheme are granted at a discount of 20% of the market price of the shares at the time of the grant and are not subject to performance conditions.
Exercise of options is subject to continued employment.
b Executive Share Option Plan ESOP.
Under this scheme executive share options are awarded at the prevailing market rate on the date of the grant.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years after grant and upon the achievement of performance criteria in relation to earnings per share, as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 34. c Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Under this scheme nil cost options are granted that will only vest provided the participant satisfies the minimum shareholding requirement and performance conditions relating to earnings per share, as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 34 and 35, are met.
The tables below summarise outstanding options that were issued after 7 November 2002.

The fair values of the SAYE, ESOP and LTIP rights are calculated at the date of grant using the BlackScholes option-pricing model.
The main assumptions used during the period, for all schemes unless otherwise stated, were: 2008 2007 Dividend yield % 5.5 3.2 Expected volatility % 24.9 to 29.4 19.2 to 21.9 Risk-free interest rate % 5.4 to 5.8 5.6 to 5.8 Expected life of rights SAYE 3 to 7 years 3 to 7 years ESOP 3 years 3 years LTIP 3 years 3 years The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the expected life of the rights.
The performance criteria of the ESOP and LTIP, as set out previously, are built into the pricing model.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period in relation to the SAYE was 53.6p 2007: 133.3p.
The fair value of options granted during the period in relation to the LTIP was 147.0p 2007: 408.0p.
The weighted average share price for options exercised over the period was 205.1p 2007: 407.7p.
The total charge for the period relating to employee share-based payment plans was 0.1 million 2007: 1.4 million, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
After tax, the total charge was 0.3 million 2007: 1.1 million.

Merger relief was taken, relieving the Group from the need to transfer this difference to the share premium account.
The capital redemption reserve arose on share buy-backs.
Own shares represent the carrying value of investment in own shares held by the Groups ESOP and LTIP and in treasury shares as set out in the table below.
ESOP and LTIP shares are held pursuant to the Companys executive share option schemes.
The trustee of the ESOP is Bankss Brewery Insurance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Marstons PLC.
The trustee of the LTIP is Computershare Trustees C. I.
Shares held by the LTIP represent 0.4% 2007: 0.5% of issued share capital.
Treasury shares held represent 10.3% 2007: 10.0% of issued share capital.
On 9 October 2008 1.0 million treasury shares were cancelled.
Dividends on own shares have been waived.
Capital management The Group considers its capital to comprise equity share capital, share premium account, merger reserve, revaluation reserve, capital redemption reserve, hedging reserve, own shares, foreign exchange reserve and retained earnings.
In managing its capital the primary objective is to ensure that the Group is able to continue to operate as a going concern and to maximise return to shareholders through a combination of capital growth and distributions.
