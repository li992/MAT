Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies The accounting policies which follow have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Basis of preparation The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and applicable accounting standards.
Foreign currency translation The presentation and functional currency of the Company is sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the Companys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the profit and loss account, except when hedge accounting is applied.
Tangible assets Tangible assets are stated at cost and the cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life by equal annual instalments at rates of 7.5% for ofce equipment and 25% for computer equipment.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries and associate are held at historical cost less a provision for impairment.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the exception that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Post-employment benets The Company and other major UK subsidiaries of the Group participate in multi-employer dened benefit pension plans which are set up under separate trusts.
These plans are operated on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities and in accordance with FRS17 the Company accounts for its contributions to the plans as if they are dened contribution plans.
In addition, the Company has unfunded unapproved pension promises.
Contributions are made to the plan on the advice of an independent qualied actuary.
Pension plan liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
Any increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Companys unfunded unapproved pension promises expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged against operating profit.
The increase in the period in the present value of the plans liabilities, arising from the passage of time, is included in other finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Contributions to dened contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account when they become payable.
Leases Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2008 101 Notes to the Company Financial Statements Continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Companys share option schemes and the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The Company recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards.
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modied.
The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or performance conditions.
As permitted by FRS20, the Company has applied FRS20 Share-based Payment retrospectively only to equity-settled awards that had not vested as at 1 January 2005 and were granted on or after 7 November 2002.
Financial assets and liabilities The Company's principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short term borrowings, loans, cash and short term deposits.
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by reference to current market rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the profit and loss account, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by FRS26 are met.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under FRS26 and practical to do so.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classied as a cash ow hedge.
To the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in equity rather than in the profit and loss account.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity will be either recycled to the profit and loss account or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS29 and has not disclosed information required by that standard in relation to derivative financial instruments as the Groups consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS7.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classied in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.

Retirement benets The net pension liability in respect of the Company unapproved plan is reected on the Companys balance sheet.
Further details of this plan are set out on pages 107 and 108.
In addition, the Company also participates in the dened benefit plan arrangements within The Weir Group Pension & Retirement Savings Scheme and The Weir Group 1972 Pensions and Life Assurance Plan for Senior Executives.
These dened benets plans are funded multi-employer plans which are operated by The Weir Group PLC and which are run on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities.
In accordance with FRS17, the Company accounts for its contributions to these plans as if they were dened contribution plans.
While plan assets and liabilities in respect of these schemes are not reected on the Companys balance sheet, details of these plans are set out below.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualied actuaries on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit method.
The total contributions to the dened benefit plans in 2009 are expected to be 2.9m.
Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of plan assets and allowing for plan expenses.
The actual return on scheme assets in the year was a loss of 89.7m 2007: gain of 12.2m.
The assets and liabilities of the plans and the long-term expected rates of return are as follows 2008 2008 2007 2007 % m % m Equities 7.2 118.6 7.7 209.1 Insurance Policy 6.2 272.9 5.9 218.5 Bonds 4.2 91.8 4.3 159.2 Fair value of plan assets 483.3 586.8 Present value of plan liabilities 480.6 542.2 Net surplus in the plans 2.7 44.6 The equity investments and bonds which are held in plan assets are quoted and are valued at the current bid price following the adoption of the amendment to FRS17.
Previously these were valued at mid price.
The effect of this change in the value of assets at 31 December 2007 is a reduction of 0.6m.
The prior year gures have not been restated as the effect is immaterial.
