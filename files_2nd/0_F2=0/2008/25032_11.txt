IG Group Holdings plc Group Operating and Financial Review Report and Financial Statements 2008 19 Nature, objectives and strategies continued Expanding the Groups international reach The Group continues to expand its non-UK client base and in the year ended 31 May 2008 revenue from non-UK clients grew to 27% of total revenue 2007 - 21%.
It has been a significant year for international expansion with the opening of offices in Madrid and Paris in November and the acquisition of the HedgeStreet Exchange in the USA in December.
The HedgeStreet Exchange was re-opened in February and IG Markets Inc. the retail FX business based in Chicago USA, was launched in April.
The Group will continue to explore the feasibility of other branches or offices where local regulation and market conditions are suitable.
In addition, the Group continues to extend the range of third parties who introduce clients to the Group and this is an effective way of establishing a presence for the Groups regulated financial business in territories which do not merit the establishment of a local office.
The Group has multi-lingual websites for its CFD business and will continue to offer an increasing range of languages in order to further widen its global reach.
Continuing to deliver product and technological innovation The Group recognises the benefits it has experienced as a result of the introduction of innovative products.
During the year, PureDeal was launched which is a state-of-the-art browser-based financial dealing platform.
In addition, methods for clients to manage risk such as trailing stops and bungee bets have been developed.
This culture of innovation is one which the Group intends to maintain in order to continue to be at the forefront of the market in terms of product offering and technology platforms.
