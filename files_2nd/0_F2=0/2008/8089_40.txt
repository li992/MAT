The following is the analysis of deferred tax balances for Balance Sheet purposes: 2008 2007 000 000 Deferred tax liability 306,511 293,151 Deferred tax asset 39,353 31,835 267,158 261,316 At 31 December 2008, the Group has unused tax losses of 11,486,000 2007: 11,486,000 available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of 3,216,000 2007: 3,216,000, has been recognised in respect of these losses.
At the Balance Sheet date, the aggregate amount of post acquisition undistributed earnings for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 512,206,000 2007: 394,211,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
