The Group is exposed to insurance risk, either directly through its Claims management risk businesses or through using insurance to reduce other risk exposures.
The risk that claims are handled or paid inappropriately is managed using a range of IT system controls and manual processes conducted Insurance risk is the risk of fluctuations in the timing, frequency or by experienced staff.

Underwriting and pricing risk Reinsurance risk The Group manages underwriting and pricing risk through the use of Reinsurance is used to protect against the impact of major catastrophic underwriting guidelines which detail the class, nature and type of events or unforeseen volumes of, or adverse trends in, large individual business that may be accepted: pricing policies by product line and by claims and to transfer risk that is outside the Groups current risk brand: and centralised control of policy wordings and any subsequent appetite.
Reinsurance of risks above the Groups risk appetite is only effective if the reinsurance premium makes economic sense and the counterparty is financially secure.
Acceptable reinsurers are rated Aor better unless specifically authorised.
230 RBS Group Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Reserving risk Reserving risk relates to both premiums and claims.
It is the risk that reserves are assessed incorrectly such that insufficient funds have been retained to pay or handle claims as the amounts fall due.
Claims development data provides information on the historical pattern of reserving risk.
This facilitates the generation of reserves to cover claims which have been incurred but not reported comprehensive underwriting and claims data, which are used to IBNR reserves for all classes at a sufficient level to meet all liabilities accurately price and monitor the risks accepted.
