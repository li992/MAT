Deferred taxation continued At 31 March 2008 the group had operating losses, capital losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 23.3 billion 2007: 21.1 billion.
The groups capital losses and other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arise.
Restricted losses: Americas 310 2013 2028 Europe 1,788 2008 2023 Total restricted losses 2,098 Unrestricted losses: Operating losses 2,747 No expiry Capital losses 17,562 No expiry Other 940 No expiry Total unrestricted losses 21,249 Total 23,347 At the balance sheet date, the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was 10.6 billion 2007: 9.3 billion.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of those unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised are insignicant.
