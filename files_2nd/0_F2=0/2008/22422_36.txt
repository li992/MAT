42 The City of London Investment Trust plc Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Accounts continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective and policy as stated on pages 14 and 15.
In pursuing its investment objective and policy, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These risks market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit and counterparty risk and the directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The Board and the Portfolio Manager coordinate the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to manage the risks that are set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period.
This note sets out a summary of the Companys financial assets and financial liabilities by category.
16.1 Market risk The fair value of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises currency risk see note 16.1.
1, interest rate risk see note 16.1.
2 and other price risk see note 16.1.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks: these have remained substantially unchanged from those applying in the year ended 30 June 2007.
The Portfolio Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
1 Currency risk A proportion of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and presentational currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The Investment Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board at each Board meeting.
The Investment Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and total return of a movement in the exchange rate to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowing is used to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Where appropriate, they are used to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the Company in meeting its investment objectives.
These borrowings are limited to 30% of net asset value.
Investment income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 30 June are nil.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
The City of London Investment Trust plc Report & Accounts 2008 43 Notes to the Accounts continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued Foreign currency sensitivity The Companys sensitivity to movements in exchange rates affecting its investment income, assuming a 10% rise or fall in the Sterling US Dollar rate amounted to 251,000 2007: 209,000.
The 10% movement has been based on average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months.
The Companys investments are predominantly in Sterling-based securities and its exposure to other currencies is not considered material.
2 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of investments of fixed interest securities the level of income receivable from interest-bearing securities and cash at bank and on deposit the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and borrowing under the multi-currency loan facility.
The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances, with short term borrowings being used when required.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts have not been used during the year to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 30 June of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to floating interest rates when the interest rate is due to be re-set.
2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2008 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash at bank 350 350 8,268 8,268 Creditors within one year: Borrowings under multi-currency loan facility 13,956 13,956 Total exposure to interest rates 13,606 13,606 8,268 8,268 Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a margin linked to LIBOR 2007: same Interest paid on borrowings under the multi-currency loan facility is at a margin over LIBOR for the type of loan.
The weighted average interest rate of these is 6.0% as at 30 June 2008 2007: nil.

The figures in the more than 5 years column also include the capital to be repaid.
The Company also has in issue non-redeemable Preference and Preferred Ordinary Stocks with a total par value of 1,399,000 2007: 1,888,000 which have an ongoing annual finance cost of 157,000 2007: 178,000.
Interest rate risk sensitivity The Company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its loan facility with Royal Bank of Scotland.
The sensitivity is as follows: Borrowings vary throughout the year as a result of the Boards borrowing policy.
Net borrowings at the year end were 13,606,000 and if that level of borrowings was maintained for a full year, then a 100 basis points change in LIBOR up or down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 136,000.
3 Other price risks Other price risks changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of investments.
Management of the risks The Board manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the Managers compliance with the Companys objectives, including investment strategy and asset allocation.
When appropriate, the Company may manage its exposure to risk by buying selling put or call options or futures on indices and on equity investments in its portfolio.
At 30 June 2008 the Company did not have any open positions 2007: nil.
Concentration of exposure to other price risks An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on pages 10 and 11.
This shows that the majority of the investments value is in UK listed companies.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to the UK, though it is recognised that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
The City of London Investment Trust plc Report & Accounts 2008 45 Notes to the Accounts continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the equity to an increase or decrease of 10% in the fair values of the Companys investments.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
16.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is not significant and is managed as follows: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the Portfolio Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
46 The City of London Investment Trust plc Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Accounts continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.4 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments and derivatives or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank, bank overdrafts and amounts due under the multi-currency loan facility.
16.5 Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern, and to maximise the revenue and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The Companys capital is its equity share capital and reserves that are shown in the balance sheet and loans, preference shares and debentures as shown in notes 14 and 15 at a total of 630,075,000 2007: 766,545,000.
The Board, with the assistance of the Portfolio Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers view on the market the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in treasury, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium as well as the discount of the peer group and the level of the equity market the need for new issues of equity shares, including issues from treasury the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Company is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements: borrowings under the loan facility are not to exceed 25% of the adjusted portfolio value as a public company, the Company has a minimum share capital of 50,000 in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividends, the Company has to be able to meet the capital retention tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
The Company has complied with these requirements.
