Pro forma income statement unaudited continued The exceptional demerger costs can be analysed as follows: 2007 Group m IT separation costs 2.3 Defined benefit pension credit 3.5 Accelerated share-based payment charge 2.4 Other 1.6 2.8 Tax credit 0.4 2.4 The pro forma adjustments can be analysed as follows: 2007 Group Notes m Additional interest charge due to higher interest rates a 0.8 Interest credit on capital contribution b 1.9 Corporate office costs c 2.8 Group interest payable d 2.0 0.3 Tax credit 0.1 0.2 The pro forma adjustments can be explained as follows: a An adjustment has been included to increase finance costs to reflect the fact that the Group is subject to higher interest rates now that borrowings are no longer guaranteed by Provident Financial plc.
b As part of the demerger, the Group received a capital contribution of 70.0m from Provident Financial plc see note 26.
This pro forma adjustment reflects the interest that would have been earned on this capital contribution had it been received prior to the start of 2007. c An adjustment in respect of additional corporate office costs is included to reflect that as a stand alone entity with its own corporate office the Group incurs additional costs compared with when it was a division of Provident Financial plc.
d While the Group was part of the Provident Financial plc group it was subject to certain interest charges that would not have been incurred if it was a stand alone entity.
These interest charges which were not included in the reported profit for the international division in the Provident Financial plc segmental analysis have therefore been reversed.
