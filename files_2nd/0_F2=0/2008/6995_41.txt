Share-based payments At present the Group has three share award plans: 1.
Halfords Company Share Option Scheme CSOP 2.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP 1.
Halfords Company Share Option Scheme The CSOP was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three year performance condition.
For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share EPS over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 5% per year for the 2005 scheme and 3.5% for options granted in 2006 and 2007 respectively.
In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year.
For increases in excess of 6% but less than 10%, a proportion of the option in excess of 150% of salary can be exercised.
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.

Share-based payments continued Options were valued using the BlackScholes option-pricing models.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
Halfords Sharesave Scheme The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service.
Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder completes his saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the Company or business which employs the option holder is transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding-up of the Company.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations were as follows: 7 August 1 August 11 August 7 June Grant date 2007 2006 2005 2004 Share price at grant date 4.02 3.01 3.07 2.64 Exercise price 3.22 3.01 3.07 2.64 Number of employees 1,064 343 573 1,561 Shares under option 929,890 173,558 269,037 1,364,861 Vesting period years 333 3 Expected volatility 22% 22% 36% 39% Option life years 333 3 Expected life years 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 Risk-free rate 5.54% 4.75% 4.68% 4.68% Expected dividend yield 4.10% 4.10% 4.00% 4.00% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 44% 44% 53% 36% Expectations of meeting performance criteria 100% 100% 100% 100% Fair value per option 1.01 0.44 0.81 0.65 Number of options outstanding at 28 March 2008 799,504 115,333 148,600 4,631 90 Halfords Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 14909 27 05 2008 Proof 3 149 14909HALFORDS:Layout 1 27 5 08 14:30 Page 91 20.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan The introduction of a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the executive Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares.
To date, three schemes have been approved for 2005, 2006 and 2007.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Companys performance over the three-year period following the award date.
The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR performance and the vesting of the other 50% by the Companys absolute EPS performance against RPI.
The Companys TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 350 general retailers as a comparator group.
No retesting will be permitted.
The TSR element of the options granted under the 2007 scheme have been valued using a model developed by Deloitte.
The Deloitte model uses the Groups share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the LTIP tranche rather than generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a Monte Carlo model.
For the 2005 and 2006 schemes the TSR element of the options were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation were as follows: 12 July 11 July 8 August Grant date 2007 2006 2005 Share price at grant date 4.02 3.01 3.07 Number of employees 21 18 17 Shares under option 539,893 596,908 537,417 Vesting period years 333 Expected volatility 22% 22% 31% Option life years 333 Expected life years 333 Expected dividend yield 4.10% 4.25% 4.00% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 30% 30% 30% Expectations of meeting performance criteria 100% 100% 50% Fair value per option 2.69 1.82 2.19 Number of shares outstanding 28 March 2008 421,943 385,657 342,427 As the LTIP awards have a nil exercise price the risk-free rate of return does not have any effect on the estimated fair value and therefore is excluded from the above table.
