Notes on the accounts continued 24 Financial instruments continued Hedge accounting In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document prospectively the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is reperformed periodically to ensure that the hedge has remained, and is expected to remain highly effective.
Fair value estimation Derivative financial instruments The fair values of derivatives are determined based on market data primarily yield curves, implied volatilities and exchange rates to calculate the present value of all estimated flows associated with each derivative at the balance sheet date.
In the absence of sufficient market data, fair values would be based on the quoted market price of similar derivatives.
Other financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and liabilities with maturities of less than 1 year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
For financial assets and liabilities with maturities of more than 1 year, fair values are based on quoted market prices, market prices of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date or discounted cash flow analysis.
