Further details on these business segments are given in the Business Review on pages 16 to 30.
The Group operates in two principal geographical areas: the UK and Western Continental Europe.
Two further segments are identied: Eastern Continental Europe and the Rest of the World.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Central administration costs are allocated to the individual segments on a consistent basis year-on-year.
Assets and liabilities have been analysed by segment at a capital employed level.
Capital employed excludes items of a nancing nature, taxation balances, post-retirement benefit liabilities and non-current asset investments: segmental capital employed comprises identiable segment assets less segmental liabilities.

The recoverable amount of the Groups cashgenerating units is calculated on the present value of their respective expected future cash ows the value-in-use or the net selling price fair value, if greater.
Given the limited available information on the likely fair value of the Groups assets, the recoverable amount used is predominately the value-in-use.
The value-in-use calculations use a pre-tax discount rate derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital, and discount a five-year period with a terminal value.
Value-in-use cash ows are based for the forthcoming and subsequent financial years on the Groups Plan approved by the Board of Directors: subsequent years cash ows are based on estimates of future performance.
Based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market, the key assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: long-term sales growth up to 3.0%: capital expenditure equal to annual depreciation: and nominal growth in profit at terminal value up to 3.0%.

Financial instruments The Groups activities expose the business to a number of key risks which have the potential to affect the ability to achieve its business objectives.
A summary of the Groups key financial risks and the policies and objectives in place to manage these risks is set out in the Financial Review and Risk Management sections of the Business Review on pages 26 to 32.
The derivative financial instruments set out in this note have been entered into to help achieve the Groups risk management objectives.
The Groups treasury policy is not to engage in speculative transactions.

Financial instruments continued b Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and commodity risks associated with the Groups underlying business activities and the nancing of these activities.
All derivatives have been designated as effective hedging instruments and are carried at their fair value.
The assets and liabilities of the Group as at 30 April in respect of derivative financial instruments are as follows: Assets Liabilities Net 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m m m Derivatives held to Manage the Groups exposure to foreign exchange on foreign currency investments 28.1 7.4 28.1 7.4 Manage the interest rate and currency exposures on borrowings 0.4 0.2 13.0 23.1 12.6 22.9 Derivative financial instruments included in net debt 0.4 0.2 41.1 30.5 40.7 30.3 Derivatives held to Hedge future transactions energy costs 17.1 0.7 0.2 2.6 16.9 1.9 Hedge future transactions foreign exchange on purchases and sales of goods and services 0.7 0.3 0.7 0.3 Total derivative financial instruments 17.5 0.9 42.0 33.4 24.5 32.5 Current 7.3 0.7 0.8 1.7 6.5 1.0 Non-current 10.2 0.2 41.2 31.7 31.0 31.5 17.5 0.9 42.0 33.4 24.5 32.5 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 81 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 20.
Financial instruments continued c Cash ow, fair value and net investment hedges i Cash ow hedging reserve movements The following table identies the movements in the cash ow hedging reserve during the year.
2008 2007 m m Balance at 1 May 1.5 0.3 Unrealised fair value gain loss on designated cash flow hedges Forward exchange contracts 0.4 0.2 Cross currency and interest rate swaps 1.5 1.9 Commodity contracts 13.0 1.7 Losses gains in equity recycled to the income statement Forward exchange contracts 0.2 0.1 Cross currency and interest rate swaps 0.3 Commodity contracts 0.5 1.3 Balance at 30 April 13.0 1.5 Gains and losses in equity transferred into profit or loss during the period are included in the following line items on the face of the income statement: 2008 2007 m m Revenue 0.1 0.1 Cost of sales 0.6 1.3 Finance costs 0.3 0.4 1.2 ii Fair value hedges At 30 April 2008, the Group held interest rate and currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on xed rate debt payable by the Group.
The receive leg of the swap contracts is largely identical for all critical aspects to the terms of the underlying debt and thus the hedging is highly effective.
The pre-tax gain on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in the year was 8.8m 2006 07: loss of 7.5m offset by a pre-tax loss on the fair value of the debt of 8.4m 2006 07: gain of 7.3m.
iii Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The Group holds currency swap contracts as hedges of long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries.
At 30 April 2008, these swaps had a fair value of 28.1 m 2007: 7.4 m and the pre-tax loss on the hedges recognised in equity in the year was 20.0m 2006 07: gain of 2.1m.
The gain or loss is matched by a similar gain or loss in equity on the retranslation of the hedged foreign subsidiarys net assets.
d Risk identication and risk management i Capital risk The Group funds its operations from the following sources of cash: operating cash ow, borrowings, shareholders equity and disposals of peripheral businesses, where appropriate.
The Groups objective is to achieve a capital structure that results in an appropriate cost of capital whilst providing exibility in immediate and medium-term funding so as to accommodate material investments or acquisitions.
The Group also aims to maintain a strong balance sheet and to provide continuity of nancing by having a range of maturities and borrowings from a variety of sources.
The Groups overall treasury objectives are to ensure sufficient funds are available for the Group to carry out its strategy and to manage financial risks.
The Groups treasury strategy is controlled though the Treasury Committee, which meets regularly and includes the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and the Group Treasurer.
The Group Treasury Function operates in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and controlled by the Group Treasurer.
The function arranges funding for the Group, provides a service to operations and implements strategies for interest rate, foreign exchange rate and energy exposure management.
ii Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ows of a financial instrument uctuate because of a change in market prices.
The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
Financial instruments continued d Risk identication and risk management continued Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both xed and oating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group maintaining an appropriate mix between xed and oating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with expectations of changes in interest rates, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest rate expense through interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
At 30 April 2008, 16% 2007: 33% of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings were xed for a period of at least one year.
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on profit and total equity of a 100 basis points rise in market interest rates representing managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates in all currencies in which the Group had variable rate borrowings at 30 April.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external interest-bearing loans and cash deposits have been increased by 100 basis points, and the resulting increase in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of the Groups interest rate derivatives.
The effect on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the market values of the Groups interest rate derivatives.
The results are presented before minority interests and tax.
2008 2007 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit total equity profit total equity m m m m Increase in market interest rates by 100 basis points 2.3 1.7 0.1 Under interest rate swap contracts the Group agrees to exchange the difference between xed and oating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
At 30 April 2008, 1.1m 2007: 0.1 m net of tax is deferred in equity in respect of cash ow hedges of interest rate risk.
This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which will occur over time to 2016.
During the year, 0.3m of gains deferred in equity were transferred to the income statement 2006 07: nil.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk on investments The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in Group entities, the functional currencies of which differ from the Groups presentational currency.
The Group hedges this exposure through borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and through cross-currency swaps.
Gains and losses for hedges of net investments are recognised in reserves.
Foreign exchange risk on borrowings The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group hedges this exposure through cross-currency swaps designated as either cash ow or fair value hedges.
Foreign exchange risk on transactions Foreign currency transaction risk arises where a business unit makes product sales and material purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
Part of this risk is hedged using foreign exchange contracts which are designated as cash ow hedges.
At 30 April 2008, 0.4 m 2007: 0.1 m net of tax is deferred in equity in respect of cash ow hedges.
This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which occurs within two years.
During the year, 0.2m of losses deferred in equity were transferred to the income statement 2006 07: 0.1m of losses.
The Groups main currency exposures are from the euro and US dollar.
The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the Groups results of a 10% change in the year-end exchange rate of sterling against all other currencies.
10% represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The analysis is only on financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and excludes the impact of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges.
Loans that are treated as net investment hedges are not recorded within the impact on the Groups profit as the impact of foreign exchange movements on these are offset by equal and opposite movements in the foreign assets that the instruments hedge.

Financial instruments continued d Risk identication and risk management continued Commodity risk The Groups main commodity exposures are to changes in UK gas and UK electricity prices.
Part of this commodity price risk is managed by a combination of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments.
At 30 April 2008, 12.3m 2007: 1.3 m net of tax is deferred in equity in respect of cash ow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
During the year, 0.5m of losses deferred in equity were transferred to the income statement 2006 07: 1.3m of gains.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase in these prices, which is managements assessment of the reasonably possible approximation of how much markets can move, on average, over any given year.
In some years prices will be less volatile and in others they may be more volatile.
A decrease of 10% in these prices would produce an opposite effect on equity.
As all of the Groups commodity financial instruments achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39, there is no impact on profit for either financial year.
2008 2007 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit total equity profit total equity m m m m 10% increase in UK electricity prices 3.1 0.8 10% increase in UK gas prices 2.2 0.5 iii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, causing financial loss to the Group.
This risk arises principally from credit exposures to customers relating to outstanding trade receivables.
The majority of the Groups trade receivables are due for maturity within 90 days.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and diverse.
Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts see note 15. Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited due to the Groups policy of restricting material deposits with banking counterparties to those with investment grade credit ratings or better.

Financial instruments continued d Risk identication and risk management continued iv Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, will have difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate financial resources, by continuously monitoring forecasted and actual cash ows and by matching the maturity prole of financial assets and liabilities to these risks.
e Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The fair value is the amount for which an asset or liability could be exchanged or settled on an arms-length basis.
For financial instruments carried at fair value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists.
The Group uses forward prices for valuing forward foreign exchange and commodity contracts and uses valuation models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value note purchase agreements, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
All derivative financial assets and liabilities are shown at fair value on the balance sheet.
Under IAS 39 hedge accounting rules, only portions of the note purchase agreements which form part of an effective fair value hedge are carried at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities which bear oating-rates of interest is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
For current and non-current receivables note 15 and current and non-current payables note 16 and provisions note 22, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value and is not included in the table below.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benets therefrom.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been provided for in respect of unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as there is no current intention for any of the relevant overseas entities to remit their earnings.

At 30 April 2008, deferred tax assets were recognised for all taxable temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses except where it is unlikely that taxable profit will be available against which to offset the loss.
In March 2007, the UK government announced an intention to amend UK tax legislation to remove tax depreciation on UK industrial buildings from 2011 onwards.
At 30 April 2008, this change in legislation has not been substantively enacted and no amendment to deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences relating to certain UK buildings.
Had the legislation been substantively enacted on 30 April 2008, the Group estimates its net deferred tax provision would have increased from 39.8m to 52.6m.

Dividends receivable on the shares owned by the Trust have been waived.
Minority interests At the beginning of the year, the Group had a liability of 12.3m and a corresponding entry against minority interests in respect of the non-controlling shareholders put option in Toscana Ondulati SpA Toscana.
This amount was calculated with reference to the recent profitability of the company using a multiple based formula.
The fair value of the put options increased during the year by 3.1m.
This charge was recorded within finance costs through the income statement and then transferred out of retained earnings into minority interest.
Certain shareholders exercised their put options selling their share in Toscana to the Group for a consideration of 11.9m with 7.6m recorded in minority interest and 4.3m recorded within goodwill.
Post-retirement benets Liability for dened benefit obligations The Group operates a funded, dened benefit scheme in the UK, the DS Smith Group Pension scheme the Group scheme.
In 2006 07 the Group operated a second funded, dened benefit scheme in the UK, the DS Smith Containers Pension Scheme the Containers scheme : the assets and liabilities of the Containers scheme were transferred to the Group scheme on 30 April 2007, with the effect that only the Group scheme operated from 1 May 2007.
The Group made agreed annual contributions of 14.6m to the Group scheme in 2007 08 2006 07: 14.6m.
Future contributions will be in part dependent on the results of the triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 30 April 2007 and related discussions between the Group and the Group schemes trustees.
The Group operates various local pension arrangements for overseas operations and unfunded arrangements for senior executives: these are, in aggregate, not significant to the Group.
The financial information given on pages 91 to 93 includes amounts related to these other arrangements, where appropriate.
A charge over certain assets of the Group has been made as security for certain of the unfunded arrangements.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Group scheme was as at 5 April 2004, which has been updated to 30 April 2008 by a qualied independent actuary.
All UK valuations used the projected unit method.
The Group scheme is closed to new entrants.
Because of this, the average age of the active members is likely to increase at future valuations and this may lead to an increasing current service contribution rate: this may be offset by a falling total pensionable salary resulting from leavers and retirements.
Post-retirement benets continued Liability for dened benefit obligations Principal actuarial assumptions are as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2005 % %%% Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.9% 5.4% 5.1% 5.3% Inflation 3.5% 2.9% 2.7% 2.6% Future salary increases 4.5% 3.9% 3.7% 3.6% Future pension increases for pre 30 April 2005 service 3.5% 2.9% 2.7% 2.6% Future pension increases for post 30 April 2005 service 2.3% 2.3% 2.3% 2.3% The sensitivity of the liabilities and annual service costs in the main UK scheme to the key assumptions above is summarised below: Increase in Increase in pension liability service costs m m 0.25% decrease in discount rate 35.0 1.0 0.25% increase in inflation 35.0 0.6 1 year increase in life expectancy 20.0 0.3 Future mortality is the most significant demographic assumption.
Recent studies have disclosed a faster increase in the rate of mortality improvement than had previously been expected.
The basic mortality table used by the Group at 30 April 2008 is PMA92 PFA92 with medium cohort mortality improvement.
This means the mortality rates assumed for members of a particular age differ from those for members who will reach that age in the future.
Studies have also illustrated that the amount of pension, the location of employees and the nature of their work are significant factors on mortality.
As a result, the basic mortality table rates are based on ages two years older than the members actual age for non-pensioners and three years older for pensioners.
At 30 April 2007, the Group used PMA92 PFA92 mortality tables with a three year age reduction adjustment for non-pensioners.

Share-based payment expense The Groups share-based payment arrangements are as follows: i An Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS is operated for Executive Directors and other senior executives.
Approved and unapproved options are granted to UK and overseas executives on a phased basis.
The vesting of any options granted under this Scheme is subject to the achievement of long-term performance conditions, being that the growth in the Companys normalised earnings per share must match or exceed the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus an average of 3% per annum over the three year period following grant.
The base financial year for the purposes of measuring earnings per share growth will be the financial year prior to the grant date.
Normally, no part of the option will vest unless the long-term performance conditions have been achieved and the vesting period of three years service has been attained.
ii In the past, Executive Directors and other senior executives received an award of shares in the Company equal in value to the participants annual cash bonus, pursuant to a Restricted Share Plan RSP.
The award of these shares is dependent upon performance in the relevant financial year.
There is a vesting period of three years service.
This scheme ceased to be operated from September 2004. iii In September 2004, the Group established a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The key features of the plan are that: awards will be made to selected Executive Directors and other senior executives over shares in the Company: performance will be measured over a single period of three financial years: awards will vest based on the Companys total shareholder return being the increase in share price and the value of reinvested dividends compared to a comparator group of companies, being the constituents of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts for initial awards: if the Companys total shareholder return is ranked at the upper quartile of the comparator group or higher, the full award will vest, reducing on a straight-line basis to 30% of the award vesting for median performance.
None of the award vests for below median performance: and additionally, no awards will vest, irrespective of total shareholder return performance, unless the Companys earnings per share growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the three-year period.
iv A Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSP is operated for Executive Directors.
Shares awarded to Directors under the Plan will vest automatically if the Director is still employed by the Company three years after the grant of the award.
v A Replacement Deferred Share Bonus Plan RDSP was awarded during the year for Mr S W Dryden.
Mr Dryden was made an award of 143,404 shares on 1 April 2008, the date he joined DS Smith Plc.
The award was made in exceptional circumstances due to the recruitment of Mr Dryden as the new Group Finance Director.
The number of shares awarded was determined by reference to the value of the entitlement to shares he forfeited under his previous arrangements with his former employer.
As discussed in section g of the Remuneration Report pages 44 and 45 the Company is seeking shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for a new Performance Share Plan to replace the ESOS and LTIP described above.

The significant inputs into the model were: share prices of 2.37 for LTIP 2007: 1.50 and 2.44 for ESOS 2007: 1.48 at the grant date: the exercise prices shown above: standard deviation of expected share price returns of 24.1% for LTIP and 26.6% for ESOS: options life disclosed above: annual risk-free interest rate of 5.5% for LTIP and 5.4% for ESOS: and expected dividend yield of 3.6% for LTIP and 3.5% for ESOS.
The volatility of share price returns measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis of daily share prices over a period of three to six years.

Acquisitions and disposals a New Thames and Grovehurst Energy On 29 February 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the voting share capital of M-real New Thames Limited, which owns a paper mill in Kent, UK.
On this date and also as part of the same acquisition, the Group acquired the balance of the voting share capital of its joint venture, Grovehurst Energy Limited, not already owned by the Group.
Grovehurst Energy provides energy and other services to the site on which the New Thames Mill operates.
The joint venture in Grovehurst Energy Limited was entered into in 1988 in connection with the Groups acquisition of the Kemsley Mill, which is adjacent to the New Thames Mill.
The results of Grovehurst Energy have been consolidated as a subsidiary from 29 February 2008.
The impact on the Groups assets and liabilities was as follows: Carrying values before Provisional acquisition fair values m m Intangible assets EU emission allowances 5.1 Property, plant and equipment 46.8 61.2 Inventories 3.0 3.0 Trade and other receivables 1.3 12.2 Trade and other payables 2.5 3.9 Provisions 7.7 Net assets acquired 48.6 69.9 Goodwill Consideration 69.9 Consideration satisfied by: Cash paid of 71.1m including 1.1m of acquisition costs, being 67.4m in relation to New Thames and 3.7m for Grovehurst Energy, less cash and cash equivalents acquired of 1.2m.
The fair value adjustments relate to the valuation of surplus EU emission allowances received as part of the acquisition: the valuation of property, plant and equipment, as determined by an external valuation rm: recognition of a provision for an onerous service contract: and deferred and current tax assets recognised on acquisition.
Deferred tax is also recognised on the temporary timing differences created by the fair value adjustments.
Due to the proximity of the acquisition to the year-end, the fair value adjustments are provisional: these will be nalised within 12 months of the acquisition.
New Thames and Grovehurst Energy contributed 0.1m to the Groups profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
It is impracticable to state what the impact would have been on Group revenue and profit for the year had the acquisition been completed on 1 May 2007 due to the proximity of the acquisition to the year-end and the changes to the operating arrangements of the business following its acquisition.
b Other acquisitions On 4 March 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity instruments of Multigraphics Holdings Limited, a print and retail display business in the UK, for a consideration of 6.7m.
The excess of the consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired of 3.1m, which includes an intangible asset of 2.6m recognised in relation to the value of the acquired order book with an estimated useful life of 10 years, has been recognised as goodwill in these consolidated financial statements.
During the year, further share capital in Toscana Ondulati SpA was acquired for 11.9m see note 23.
On 30 September 2005, the Group acquired 100% of the voting share capital of Timmermans NV.
During the year additional deferred consideration of 2.5m became due to the previous owners following the satisfaction of certain performance criteria of the acquired business.
This amount has been provided for in other provisions, with an equal and opposite increase to goodwill.
