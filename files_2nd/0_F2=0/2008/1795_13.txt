Reorganisation and integration costs of 6m 2007: 6m have been incurred, 3m relating to Balfour Beatty Communities formerly GMH Military Housing, 1m of which was borne by the Company, and 2m relating to Dean & Dyball.
Further costs of 1m have been incurred in the US on the reorganisation of the central division of Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Inc formerly Balfour Beatty Construction Inc 2007: 1m.
The 2007 exceptional items also included costs incurred on the reorganisation and integration of Balfour Beatty Construction Group Inc formerly Centex Construction 2007: 3m and the reorganisation of Balfour Beatty Rail Inc 2007: 2m.
On the acquisition of Birse Group, tax losses were acquired which did not satisfy the criteria for recognition in the balance sheet at the date of acquisition.
A portion of these losses is now recognisable and the benefit is recorded as part of the Groups tax charge in exceptional items.
IAS 12 stipulates that in addition to recognising the tax benefit the carrying amount of goodwill recognised on the acquisition is reduced, with the reduction treated as an expense.
In 2007, as a result of the request by Metronet Rail BCV Ltd to the Arbiter for an Extraordinary Review of the incurred and forecast costs, his subsequent interim award, and the consequent appointment to both Metronet Rail BCV Ltd and Metronet Rail SSL Ltd collectively Metronet of a PPP Administrator, provision was made for an estimate of the costs resulting from the administration of Metronet, including the impact on its contract with Trans4m Ltd, in which the Group owns 25% of the ordinary share capital and with which certain Group subsidiaries contracted, and other direct contracts with Group subsidiaries.
These costs included, where relevant, provision for winding down contracts, outstanding receivables and settlement of other trading items.
Following enactment of the UK Finance Act 2008, tax depreciation allowances on industrial buildings are being reduced to nil on a phased basis.
Joint ventures and associates of the Group have recognised a 4m deferred tax charge 2007: nil which is required under IAS 12 to establish a deferred tax liability.
This liability will be released to the income statement as the relevant assets are depreciated for accounting purposes.
In addition, a 1m deferred tax credit 2007: nil has been recognised following agreement with HMRC as to the basis of taxing certain PPP concessions.

8.3 The exceptional items credited to charged against profit from operations have given rise to a net tax charge of 12m 2007: 11m credit.
In addition, subsidiaries of the Group have recognised a 3m deferred tax charge 2007: nil to establish a deferred tax liability, in relation to industrial building allowances which is required under IAS 12.
This liability will be released to the income statement as the relevant buildings are depreciated for accounting purposes.
In 2007, as a result of the acquisition of Balfour Beatty Construction Group Inc formerly Centex Construction, the benefits of tax losses and other tax assets arising from temporary differences in the US crystallised and were recognised in full in accordance with IAS 12, giving rise to an exceptional gain of 51m.
8.4 In 2007, approval of the sale of the Groups 24.5% interest in its associate, Devonport Management Ltd, was obtained from the Ministry of Defence on 26 June, at which time this investment became held for sale.
On 28 June 2007, the Group completed the sale of this investment for a total cash consideration of 86m, resulting in a gain on disposal of 57m, which was credited to profit from discontinued operations.
The carrying value of this investment at the date of sale was 27m.
Costs associated with the disposal amounted to 2m.
As a result of the appointment to Metronet of a PPP Administrator, the Groups investments in the Metronet concessions, including profits recognised in previous periods, were written down to nil.

Cash flow forecasts have been based on the expected workload of each cash generating unit CGU giving consideration to the current level of confirmed orders and anticipated orders.
Cash flow forecasts for the next three years are based on the Groups 2009 budget and medium-term plan.
Thereafter the key inputs in assessing the CGU are its revenue growth rate and discount rate.
This growth rate has been applied to cash flows after three years into perpetuity and reflects published GDP growth rates for the economies that each CGU operates in.
The cash flows assume a residual value based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate in the range of 10.6%12.2% 2007: 12.4%14.9%.
The discount rates are revised annually applying updated market inputs to the standard capital asset pricing model.

The major assumptions that result in significant sensitivities are the revenue growth rate and the discount rate.
Given the Groups sensitivity analysis, a reasonable change in a single assumption will not cause impairment in any of the Groups CGUs.

The Groups financial risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse impact of these risks on the Groups financial performance.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury liaises with the Groups operating companies to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall financial risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and nonderivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored through the Groups internal audit and risk management procedures.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
a Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on contracting activities transacted in a currency that is not the functional currency of the operating company: forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the Groups investments in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures: and interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates on PPP concessions.
There has been no material change to the Groups exposure to market risks and with the exception of the change in the net investment hedging policy outlined below there has been no change in how the Group manages those risks from 2007. i Foreign currency risk management The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure to various currencies, primarily to US dollars, Hong Kong dollars and the Euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future trading transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Group policy requires operating companies to manage their transactional foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.
Group Treasury, on behalf of operating companies, enters into forward contracts to cover 100% of foreign exchange risk above pre-set materiality levels determined by the Finance Director whenever a current or future foreign currency exposure is identified.
Hedge accounting is applied to these transactions above a predetermined materiality level.
Details of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the balance sheet date in respect of foreign currency transactional exposures are set out on page 54.
As at 31 December 2008, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions where hedge accounting is not applied was 74m 2007: 13m.
The period during which the cash flows are expected to occur is up to two years.
This will affect the income statement throughout the same periods.
In the current year the Group has designated forward exchange contracts against highly probable capital expenditure and inventory sales which are expected to occur in up to four years with a notional principal amount of 24m 2007: nil as cash flow hedges.
Fair value movements of 2m 2007: nil have been taken to hedging reserves within equity in relation to these contracts in the current year and these amounts represent the cumulative amount of gains deferred in the hedging reserves relating to cash flow hedges.
The Groups investments in foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk which has been managed by matching significant net assets denominated in currencies other than sterling principally using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The hedging policy is reviewed periodically.
Management have amended the policy to reduce the level of net assets hedged taking account of the potential cash effect of the hedging programme against the potential effect of movements in currencies on the Groups net assets.
At 31 December 2008 approximately 45% of the US dollar denominated net assets were hedged while in 2007 approximately 90% of US dollar, Euro and Hong Kong dollar net assets were hedged.
The effect of a 35% 2007: 5% strengthening weakening in US dollar exchange rates against sterling would be an 87m 2007: 11m reduction increase in the fair value of the financial instruments used to hedge the Groups net assets in US dollars.
As derivative financial instruments are no longer held for Euro and Hong Kong dollar denominated assets, only 2007 comparative figures are provided in respect of Euro and Hong Kong dollar movements.
In 2007, the effect of a 5% strengthening weakening in Hong Kong dollar exchange rates against sterling would have been a 2m reduction increase in the fair value of the financial instruments used to hedge the Groups net assets in Hong Kong dollars.
In 2007, the effect of a 3% strengthening weakening in Euro exchange rates against sterling would have been a 1m reduction increase in the fair value of the financial instruments used to hedge the Groups net assets in Euros.
These movements would be taken directly to equity and would partially offset opposing gains losses in the net assets denominated in foreign currencies.
The percentage change applied to US dollars in 2008 has been based on the greater of the average movement in the previous five reporting periods or the actual movement in the last 12 months.
For 2007 the percentage change for each currency was based on the average movement in the previous five reporting periods.
The notional principal amounts of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations at 31 December 2008 was 188m 2007: 314m.
The gains and losses in equity on hedges of net investments in foreign operations will be released to the income statement on the disposal of the underlying net investment.
57 21 Financial instruments continued Financial risk factors continued ii Interest rate risk management Interest rate risk arises in the Groups PPP concessions which borrow funds at both floating and fixed interest rates and hold available-for-sale financial assets.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Group policy is to swap floating rate interest to fixed rate, using interest rate swaps, to hedge the cash flow variability of the interest.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the year-end is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the applicable year-end yield curve.
The net impact of a movement in interest rates on income would therefore be immaterial.
During 2008 and 2007, the Groups PPP borrowings at variable rate were denominated in sterling.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding PPP subsidiaries interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2008 were 142m 2007: 68m with maturities that match the maturity of the underlying borrowings ranging from one year to 26 years.
At 31 December 2008, the fixed interest rates range from 4.6% to 5.1% 2007: 4.6% to 5.1% and the principal floating rates are LIBOR.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 14m 2007: 10m increase decrease in amounts taken directly by the Group to equity.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on the available-for-sale financial assets and cash flow hedges of its PPP subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk also arises on the Groups cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and non-PPP borrowings.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 2m 2007: 1m increase decrease in the Groups net investment income.
iii Price risk management The Groups principal price risk exposure arises in its PPP concessions.
At the commencement of the concession an element of the unitary payment by the client is indexed to offset the effect of inflation on the concessions costs.
To the extent that inflation differs from the index used, the Group is exposed to a price risk.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of potential customers before entering into transactions.
For cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments the Group has a policy of depositing funds only with independently rated counterparties with a minimum long-term credit rating of A.
At 31 December 2008 2m did not meet this criterion due to the unprecedented decline during 2008 in credit ratings generally and operational and relationship difficulties in transferring certain balances.
No losses are anticipated from non-performance of these counterparties.
The credit rating of a financial institution will determine the amount and duration for which funds may be deposited under individual risk limits set by the Board for the Group and subsidiary companies.
Management monitors the utilisation of these credit limits regularly.
At 31 December 2008 30m did not meet this policy due to operational reasons.
For trade and other receivables credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable using independent ratings where available or by assessment of the customers credit quality based on its financial position, past experience and other factors.
The Groups most significant customers are public or quasi public sector entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high credit quality due to the nature of the customer.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of the above at 31 December is the carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses.
c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are set out in Note 24.1.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is set out above.
Fair value estimation The fair value of financial assets and liabilities traded in active markets is determined with reference to quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Group uses a variety of methods such as estimated discounted cash flows and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables approximates their fair values due to their short-term nature.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

ii Interest rate risk management A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 4m 2007: 2m decrease increase in the Companys investment income.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and term deposits and amounts due to and from its subsidiaries.
There would be no effect on amounts taken directly by the Company to equity.
b Credit risk The additional credit risk that the Company bears is in respect of amounts due from subsidiaries.
There were no amounts past due at the balance sheet date.
The maximum exposure is the carrying value of the financial assets recorded in the financial statements.

The Directors consider that the carrying values of current trade and other receivables approximate their fair values.
The fair value of non-current trade and other receivables amounts to 69m 2007: 71m and has been determined by discounting future cash flows using yield curves and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
It is Group policy that forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into as soon as a foreign currency trade receivable is identified.

19m 2007: 14m will expire 20 years after the year in which they arose, using losses incurred in earlier years before those incurred in later years, with the first expiry in 2019.
The remaining losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed reserves of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 350m 2007: 220m and for joint ventures and associates was nil 2007: 13m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on employees pensionable service and their pensionable salary.
Defined contribution schemes are those where the Groups obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme and the scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks.
The majority of the Groups defined benefit schemes are funded.
Defined benefit contributions are determined in consultation with the trustees, after taking actuarial advice.
The Groups main scheme is the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund BBPF, which includes defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members with the exception of certain employees transferring under TUPE.
During the current year the Group implemented measures to limit the increase in pensionable pay of certain groups of in-service defined benefit members, giving rise to a reduction in past service liabilities of 60m, which has been classified as an exceptional item in the income statement.
Certain Group employees are members of the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost section of the Railways Pension Scheme Railways Pension Scheme, which is closed to new members with the exception of certain employees transferring under TUPE.
The economic interest of the Group in this shared cost scheme is approximately 60% of the schemes assets and liabilities, based on the relevant provisions of the trust deed and rules and trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit financing.
Mansell plc operates two defined benefit schemes, which are both closed to new members, the Mansell plc Pension Scheme and the Hall & Tawse Retirement Benefit Plan Mansell schemes.
Other schemes comprise funded and unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe and North America, the majority of which arrangements are closed to new entrants.
Where schemes are closed to new members, existing members continue to accrue benefits for future service.
On 5 April 2007 the Birse Group Retirement Benefit Scheme Birse scheme merged with the BBPF.
The membership of the principal schemes is as follows: Railways Railways Balfour Beatty Pension Mansell Balfour Beatty Pension Mansell Pension Fund Scheme schemes Pension Fund Scheme schemes 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 Number of members: Defined benefit active members 5,338 425 453 6,306 490 494 deferred pensioners 13,363 1,594 1,513 13,248 1,625 1,536 pensioners, widow er s and dependants 17,063 1,256 1,298 16,852 1,193 1,291 Defined contribution 6,870 4,984 Total 42,634 3,275 3,264 41,390 3,308 3,321 IAS 19 governs the accounting for defined benefit schemes in the Groups financial statements.
Obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method and discounted to a net present value using the rate of return on high quality corporate bonds.
Pension expense relating to current service cost is charged to contracts or overheads based on the function of scheme members and is included in cost of sales and net operating expenses.
The net interest income arising from the expected return on plan assets and the interest on scheme obligations is credited to investment income or finance charges as appropriate.
Actuarial gains and losses are reported in full in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The IAS 19 accounting valuation is set out in 26.1 below.
A different calculation is used for the regular valuations undertaken by the scheme trustees to determine the future company contribution level necessary so that over time the scheme assets will meet the scheme liabilities.
The principal difference between the two methods is that under the funding basis the liabilities are discounted using a rate of return reflecting the composition of the assets in the scheme, rather than the rate of return on high-quality corporate bonds as required by IAS 19 for the accounting basis.
Details of the previous formal funding basis valuations are set out in 26.2 below.
26.1 IAS 19 accounting valuation The principal actuarial assumptions for the IAS19 accounting valuations of the Groups principal schemes are as follows: Railways Railways Balfour Beatty Pension Mansell Balfour Beatty Pension Mansell Pension Fund Scheme schemes Pension Fund Scheme schemes 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 % % % % % % Discount rate on obligations 6.45 6.45 6.45 5.85 5.85 5.85 Expected return on plan assets 6.27 7.45 6.40 6.53 7.45 6.83 Inflation rate 2.80 2.80 2.80 3.35 3.35 3.35 Future increases in pensionable salary: certain members of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund 2.80 4.85 4.85 4.85 other members 4.30 4.30 4.30 4.85 4.85 4.85 Rate of increase in pensions in payment or such other rate as is guaranteed 2.80 2.80 2.80 3.35 3.35 3.35 68 Notes to the accounts 26 Retirement benefit obligations continued The mortality tables adopted for the 2008 and 2007 IAS 19 valuations are the 1992 series calendar year 2007 tables, with future improvements applicable to each members year of birth under the medium cohort effect from 2007.

The actuary is also able to monitor changes in the exhibited mortality over time.
As a result of these reviews the Group is able to adopt with a measure of confidence consistent mortality assumptions across its various defined benefit schemes.
In 2007 the reviews suggested continuing improvements in life expectancy and therefore the mortality assumptions were strengthened compared with the previous formal funding valuations and the 31 December 2006 valuation reviews.

During the year, 300,017 preference shares 2007: 4,957,163 were repurchased for cancellation by the Company for a total consideration of 407,337 2007: 7,500,535 at an average price of 135.8p 2007: 151.3p.
Holders of preference shares are entitled to a preferential dividend equivalent to a gross payment of 10.75p per preference share per annum, payable half-yearly.
Any preference shares still outstanding are redeemable on 1 July 2020 at 1 each, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, unless the holder exercises any option granted by the Company to extend the redemption date.
The maximum redemption value of all of the issued and outstanding preference shares, excluding any arrears or accruals of dividend, was 112m at 31 December 2008 2007: 112m.
At the option of the holder, preference shares are convertible on the first day of the next calendar month following receipt of the conversion notice into new Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares effectively on the basis of 21.05263 ordinary shares for every 100 preference shares, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The Company is entitled to convert all outstanding preference shares into ordinary shares if there are fewer than 44,281,239 preference shares in issue or if the average of the closing mid-market price for a Balfour Beatty plc ordinary share during a 30 day period exceeds 950p, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The preference shares carry no voting rights at a general meeting of the Company, except where the dividend is six months or more in arrears, or where the business of the meeting includes a resolution which directly affects the rights and privileges attached to the preference shares or a resolution for the winding-up of the Company.
On a winding-up of the Company, holders are entitled to receive the sum of 1 per preference share, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, in priority to any payment on any other class of shares.
The preference shares are regarded as a compound instrument, consisting of an equity and a liability component.
The fair value of the liability component at the date of issue, included under non-current liabilities, was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 13.5% for a similar non-convertible instrument.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of preference shares and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in shareholders equity, net of deferred tax.
The liability component recognised on the balance sheet is calculated as follows: 2008 2007 m m Redemption value of shares in issue at 1 January 112 117 Equity component 16 16 Deferred tax and interest element 9 11 Liability component at 1 January at amortised cost 87 90 Repurchase of preference shares 3 Liability component at 31 December at amortised cost 87 87 The fair value of the liability component of the preference shares at 31 December 2008 amounted to 192m 2007: 142m.
The fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at interest rates reflecting the yield curve at the balance sheet date.
Interest expense on the preference shares is calculated using the effective interest method.

By special resolution on 13 May 2004, confirmed by the court on 16 June 2004, the share premium account was reduced by 181m and the 4m capital redemption reserve was cancelled, effective on 25 June 2004, and a special reserve of 185m was created.
This reserve becomes distributable to the extent of future increases in share capital and share premium account, of which 25m occurred in 2008 2007: 5m.
On 20 May 2008, 43,320,411 ordinary shares were issued and placed with institutions at a price of 430p per share, raising 182m after issue costs of 4m.
The placing qualified for merger relief under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 so that the premium arising was not required to be credited to the Companys share premium account.
29.3 The retained profits in the Group and the retained profit of the Company are stated net of investments in Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares of 50p each acquired by the Groups employee discretionary trust, the Balfour Beatty Employee Share Ownership Trust, to satisfy awards under the Balfour Beatty performance share plan and the Balfour Beatty deferred bonus plan.
The market value of the 3.7m 2007: 1.8m shares held by the Trust at 31 December 2008 was 12.2m 2007: 8.9m.
Following confirmation of the performance criteria at the end of the performance period in the case of the performance share plan, and at the end of the vesting period in the case of the deferred bonus plan, the appropriate number of shares will be unconditionally transferred to participants.
In 2008, 1.1m shares were transferred to participants in relation to the April 2005 awards under the performance share plan 2007: 0.7m shares for the April 2004 awards.

80 Notes to the accounts 31 Share-based payments continued 31.4 Performance share plan awards: The Company operates a performance share plan under which executive Directors and key senior employees are granted conditional awards of ordinary shares in the Company, which are exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of award.
These awards will only vest to the extent that performance targets are met over a three year performance period.
On 15 April 2008 a maximum of 2,042,490 conditional shares were awarded which are normally exercisable in April 2011.
50% of the 2008 award is based on an eps growth target: the maximum award of shares is made only where the Companys eps increases by at least RPI 45% in the relevant performance period: 25% of this element of the award is made where the Companys eps increases by RPI 15% over the period: if growth in eps is between RPI 15% and RPI 45%, the number of shares will be awarded pro-rata to the growth in eps: and no shares from this element of the award can be awarded if growth in eps is less than RPI 15% over the period.
The other 50% of that 2008 award is based on total shareholder return TSR performance measured against a group of UK listed companies operating in comparable markets to the Company: the maximum award of shares is made only where the Companys TSR is in the upper quartile: 25% of this element of the award is made where the Companys TSR is at the median: if the Companys TSR is between the median and the upper quartile, the number of shares will be awarded pro-rata: and no shares can be awarded if the Companys TSR is below median.

Where the Company enters into such agreements, it considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, guarantees are treated as contingent liabilities until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make payment under the guarantee.
As stated in Note 27, provision has been made for the Directors best estimate of known legal claims, investigations and legal actions in progress.
The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
On 17 April 2008, the Office of Fair Trading OFT published its Statement of Objections arising from a major investigation into tender activities across the entire UK construction sector.
The Company has provided the OFT with its response to the Statement of Objections.
Subject to ongoing co-operation, the Company has been granted leniency, which will reduce any fines ultimately levied: however the outcome remains uncertain.

Project descriptions: The projects comprise 11 military family housing privatisation projects with the United States Department of the Army Army, covering 16 Army bases: four projects with the United States Department of the Air Force Air Force, covering nine Air Force bases and two projects with the United States Department of the Navy Navy, covering 19 Navy bases.
In addition, during the first quarter of 2008, Balfour Beatty Communities, through its subsidiaries, completed the closing on the award of its first unaccompanied personnel housing UPH project at Fort Stewart, located in Hinesville, Georgia.
These projects in operation cover 44 domestic bases located in 20 states and Washington, DC and Balfour Beatty Communities expects them to contain over 33,000 end-state housing units once full development, construction and renovation have been completed.
The first phase of the project, known as the initial development period, covers the period of initial construction or renovation of military housing on a base, typically lasting three to eight years.
For each project, Balfour Beatty Communities creates a special purpose entity to serve as the owner of the project, which is typically either a limited liability company or general partnership.
With respect to Army and Navy projects, the government becomes a member or partner of the project entity Project LLC : and, whereas the Air Force is not a named partner or member in Balfour Beatty Communities Project LLCs, it contributes a commitment to provide a government direct loan to the Project LLC and has similar rights to share in distributions and cash flows of the Project LLC.
Contractual arrangements: In connection with each project, the Project LLC enters into a ground lease with the government, which provides the Project LLC with a leasehold interest in the land and title to the improvements on the land for a period of 50 years.
Each of these military housing privatisation projects includes agreements covering the management and development of existing housing units, as well as the development, construction, renovation and management of new units during the term of the project, which, in the case of the Army, potentially could extend for up to an additional 25 years.
The 50 year duration of each project calls for continuous renovation, rehabilitation, demolition and reconstruction of housing units through various predetermined project phases.
At the end of the ground lease term the Project LLCs leasehold interest terminates and all project improvements on the land generally transfer to the US Government.
Preferred returns: The projects will typically receive, to the extent that adequate funds are available, an annual, minimum preferred rate of return.
On most existing projects, this annual minimum preferred rate of return ranges from 9% to 12% of Balfour Beatty Communities initial equity contribution to the project.
During the initial development period, the project is precluded from distributing funds to pay the minimum preferred rate of return.
The unpaid amounts generally will accrue and accumulate, and can be used to fund renovation and construction costs, if necessary.
If the accumulated funds are not needed to fund renovation and construction costs, they are at the end of the initial development period distributed to pay accrued preferred returns to Balfour Beatty Communities and the US Government in accordance with the terms of the project agreements.
Split of remaining operating cash flows: Subsequent to the initial development period, any operating cash flow remaining after the annual minimum preferred rate of return is paid is split between Balfour Beatty Communities and the US Government, and the reinvestment account held by the project for the benefit of the US Government.
On most of the existing projects, the total amount that each party is entitled to receive inclusive of the preferred return is generally capped at an annual modified rate of return, or cash-on-cash return, on its initial equity contribution to the project.
Historically, these annual caps have ranged between approximately 11% to 17% depending on the particular project.
However, in some of the more recent projects, there are either no annual caps or lower projected annual rates of return.
The total capital return generally will include the annual minimum preferred return discussed above.
The reinvestment account is an account established for the benefit of the military, but funds may be withdrawn for ongoing construction, development and renovation costs during the remaining life of a privatisation project upon approval by the applicable military branch.
Return of equity: Generally, at the end of a project term, any monies remaining in the reinvestment account are distributed to Balfour Beatty Communities and the Army, Navy or Air Force, as applicable, in a predetermined order of priority.
Typically these distributions will have the effect of providing the parties with sufficient funds to provide a minimum annual return over the life of the project and a complete return of the initial capital contribution.
After payment of the minimum annual return and the return of a partys initial contribution, all remaining funds will typically be distributed to the Army, Navy or Air Force, as applicable.
