Service Contracts and Letters of Appointment The Companys policy is that service contracts of Executive Directors should have notice periods of six months, but it recognises that for future external appointments a longer initial period might be required.
In that event, the notice period would reduce to six months after a specified period.
Each Executive Director has a rolling one year service contract and each is subject to six months notice at any time.
Mike Wagstaff entered into a contract on 5 May 2005, Jon Murphy on 11 March 2002, Peter Turner on 7 November 2007 and Rod Begbie on 3 July 2007.
In the event that an Executive Directors employment is terminated as a result of a change in control of the Group, or if he is required to take an alternative non-equivalent position within six months of a change in control, then this will be deemed to be constructive dismissal and the notice period will be treated as having increased to 12 months immediately prior to such deemed dismissal.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has a letter of appointment entered into on 14 May 2008 and which will expire on 13 May 2009.
In the event that a Non-Executive Directors appointment is terminated or he resigns voluntarily, there will be an entitlement to a severance payment of either 10,000 or the amount that would be payable for the unexpired term under the letter of appointment.
