Operating segments The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments in advance of its effective date.
IFRS 8 adopts a strict management approach to segment reporting and requires that operating segments be identified on the same basis as financial information is reported internally to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of allocating resources between segments and assessing their performance.
IAS 14, the previously effective standard on segment reporting, was similar, in that identification of segments started with internal financial reporting to key management personnel.
However its main focus was on components of the business with similar risks and generating similar returns which could potentially be very different to the management approach.
The Groups Directors consider that the adoption of IFRS 8 does not lead to a material change in the identification of the Groups segments as the business segments reported to the Groups Board of Directors have clearly defined lines of risk and reward.
The Board of Directors is considered to be the chief operating decision maker for the Group.
Under IAS 14 in previous financial years, the primary segments were identified by business type.
No secondary geographical segments were presented on materiality grounds.
As described below the segments presented under IFRS 8 continue to be identified by business type.
In addition, the Groups Directors consider that the car insurance segment should be sub-divided into two geographical reportable segments: UK and Non-UK, on the basis of it being useful information to users of the financial statements rather than the breach of quantitative thresholds within the standard.
The following segments represent the principal split of business that is regularly reported to the Groups Board of Directors, and therefore become the Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8: UK car insurance The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance and the generation of ancillary income in the UK.
The Directors consider the results of these activities to be reportable as one segment as the activities carried out in generating the income are not independent of each other and are performed as one business.
This mirrors the approach taken in management reporting.
Price comparison The segment relates to the Groups price comparison operation Confused.
This operation had previously been combined with the Groups commercial van insurance broker, Gladiator, to form an Insurance Broking segment.
However based on the management reporting approach, the Directors consider that Price comparison is an independent reportable segment.
Non-UK car insurance The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance and the generation of ancillary income outside of the UK.
It specifically covers the Groups Balumba.
it operations in Spain, Germany and Italy respectively.
Other The other segment includes the Gladiator broking operation in addition to certain central expenses, overseas development expenses, share scheme costs, finance charges and interest.
None of these are reportable segments based on their immateriality.
Taxes are not allocated across the segments and are included for the purposes of reconciliation to the Income Statement.

There is an asymmetrical allocation of assets and income to the reportable segments, in that the interest earned on cash and cash equivalent assets deployed in the UK car insurance, Price comparison and Non-UK car insurance segments is allocated to the Other reportable segment.
Eliminations represent inter-segment funding and balances included in trade and other receivables and other payables.
