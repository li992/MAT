For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume issue of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, being those share options and awards with a non-market based performance condition granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
At 3 February 2008 and 28 January 2007, the performance criteria for the vesting of those awards with a market based performance condition had not been met and, consequently, the shares in question are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.
Reconciliations of earnings and the weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculations are set out below.

The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 3 February 2008 of 5.2 pence per share which will absorb 18.9 million of shareholders funds.
This is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting and thus has not been provided for at 3 February 2008.
Once approved, the final dividend will be paid on 25 June 2008 to shareholders on the register of members on 30 May 2008.

The recoverable amounts have been measured based on value in use.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations, which were performed for the cash generating unit that comprises Farnell UK, based on data available at the mid-point of the financial year, were as follows: Sales growth for the current year was based on internal forecasts with growth in the five subsequent years broadly in line with historic UK GDP and a terminal growth rate of 2.25%.
Gross margins were projected based on recent trends.
A market risk premium, of 4.5%, was used in calculating the weighted average cost of capital.
Forecast cash flows have been prepared for a period of five years.
From the second year onwards, the rate of growth used does not exceed the long-term growth rate for the industry in which the business operates.
The cash flows that these projections produce have been discounted at a post-tax discount rate of 10.9%.
No impairment arose during the year as a result of this test.
The remaining goodwill of 4.5 million is allocated across five different cash generating units.
No impairments arose during the year in relation to these amounts.

The fair value of the debt element is established on issue of the shares, based on the discounted cash flows of the instrument to the date of maturity and is then increased each year on a straight line basis through the income statement in order to arrive at the redemption amount payable on maturity of the shares.
89 Premier Farnell Annual Report & Accounts 2008 15 Preference shares continued The movement in the debt and equity elements during the year is as follows: Equity Debt element element m m At 29 January 2007 18.4 103.1 Premium on redemption 1.3 Purchase of preference shares 3.2 18.5 At 3 February 2008 15.2 85.9 During the year the Company purchased and cancelled 1,236,500 of its preference shares at a total cash cost of 17.7 million.
Based on the book value and fair value of the instrument at the date of purchase, the financial liability element of the preference shares was reduced by 18.5 million and the equity element by 3.2 million.
A gain of 0.9 million was recognised in the income statement being the difference between the book value and fair value of the financial liability element at the date of purchase.
The gain arising from the difference between the book value and fair value of the equity element of 3.1 million was recognised as a movement in retained earnings.
A deferred tax credit of 0.6 million arose which is also recognised as a movement in retained earnings.
A transfer from retained earnings of 1.2 million to nondistributable reserves was made in order to maintain the legal nominal value of share capital.
In the prior year, the Company purchased and cancelled 565,000 of its preference shares at a total cost of 8.4 million, resulting in a gain of 0.3 million being recognised in the income statement.
The prior year Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense SORIE included the associated deferred tax credit arising of 0.3 million.
However, the deferred tax credit should not be reflected through the SORIE and thus the prior year SORIE has been restated to exclude this amount.
The restatement has no impact on retained earnings or shareholders funds.
At 3 February 2008, the preference shares comprised 148,368 2007: 149,478 US$1.35 cumulative, convertible, redeemable preference shares of 1 each the US preference shares and 5,625,353 2007: 6,860,743 89.2p cumulative, convertible, redeemable preference shares of 1 each the sterling preference shares and, together with the US preference shares, the preference shares.
The rights and restrictions attaching to the preference shares are as follows: 1 Currency Holders of preference shares are entitled to receive a preferential dividend, a distribution on a winding up and a payment on redemption.
Holders of US preference shares receive such payments in US dollars.
Holders of sterling preference shares receive such payments in sterling.
2 Changeover A holder of US preference shares may serve notice on the Company requiring that some or all of their US preference shares be changed to sterling preference shares.
3 Income a Each holder has a right to receive a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of US$1.35 per annum for every 1 of nominal value for the US preference shares and at the rate of 89.2p per annum for every 1 of nominal value for the sterling preference shares.
Dividends on the preference shares are payable half-yearly in arrears in equal amounts, on 26 January and 26 July.
b The fixed cumulative preferential dividends payable in respect of the preference shares are paid in priority to any dividend payable to the holders of ordinary shares and in priority to or pari passu with the holders of any other class of preference shares in the capital of the Company.
c If a holder of US preference shares has elected to changeover his US preference shares to sterling preference shares then the fixed cumulative preferential dividend and any arrears payable after the changeover date will be paid at the sterling rate set out above.
4 Conversion a Each holder of preference shares is entitled to convert all or any of his fully paid preference shares into fully paid ordinary shares at the rate of 10.3432p in nominal amount of ordinary share capital for every 1 in nominal amount of preference share capital so converted the conversion rate.
b The preference shares may be converted on any date at the option of the holder on and from the date of issue up to and including 22 April 2016. c If at any time 75% or more of all the preference shares have been converted into ordinary shares but assuming, for this purpose only, that any preference shares which have been converted into ordinary shares pursuant to the special conversion right made available in 2002 had never been issued or converted, the Company may give written notice to the remaining holders of preference shares to convert the remaining preference shares into ordinary shares.
d The conversion rate may be subject to adjustment if, inter alia, the Company makes an issue of ordinary shares by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves, a rights issue or another offer to ordinary shareholders or if there is a change of control in the Company following a take-over offer or if a capital distribution is made.
90 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 15 Preference shares continued 5 Redemption The Company shall subject to any statutory restrictions on 29 April 2016 redeem all the US preference shares in issue at US$25 for every 1 of nominal value and all the sterling preference shares in issue at 16.518 for every 1 of nominal value.
6 Voting Each preference share entitles the holder to receive notice of but not to attend or vote at general meetings of the Company save in limited circumstances.
Subject to being entitled to vote on any resolution, each holder of preference shares has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll every such holder has one vote for every ordinary share to which he would be entitled on conversion of his preference shares.
7 Winding up Subject to the rights attached to any shares issued on any special terms and conditions, on a return of capital on a winding-up of the Company the assets available for distribution will be applied, first, in paying to each holder of a preference share any arrears and accruals of the preferential dividend: second, in repaying US$25 for every 1 of nominal value for the US preference shares and 16.518 for every 1 of nominal value for the sterling preference shares: third, in repaying the capital paid up on each ordinary share: and fourth, in distributing the remainder rateably among the members of the Company according to the amounts paid up on their respective holdings of shares in the Company, each preference share being treated for this purpose as if converted at the conversion rate applicable into fully paid ordinary shares immediately prior to the commencement of the winding-up.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of any unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where such remittance is envisaged in the foreseeable future and would have a significant impact on the tax liability.
During the year, as a result of the change in UK corporation tax rates which will be effective from 1 April 2008, deferred tax balances have been re-measured.
Deferred tax relating to temporary differences which are expected to reverse prior to 1 April 2008 have been measured at 30% and deferred tax relating to temporary differences expected to reverse after 1 April 2008 have been measured at the tax rate of 28%, being the tax rates which will apply on reversal.
The impact of this is a credit within the deferred tax charge for the year of 0.8 million 2007: nil.
During the year it was also announced that the availability of tax allowances on certain expenditure on buildings would be phased out and this will be enacted as part of the 2008 Budget, effective from 1 April 2008.
It is expected that this change will increase the Groups deferred tax liabilities in the next financial year by 0.8 million.

This comprised a restructuring of the sales and logistics operations under which branches will focus solely on delivering sales and customer service by relinquishing responsibility for procurement, local inventory and logistics.
These activities have been streamlined through the creation of a number of regional distribution centres, supported by the business national distribution centre in Coventry.
The restructuring also included a review of the profitability of customer contracts and the centralisation of procurement.
In the period up to the disposal of the BuckHickman business, 0.1 million of the provision was utilised.
Dilapidation costs Provision for dilapidation costs represents the estimated cost of dilapidation work on BuckHickman leased properties prior to the properties being vacated at the end of their lease term.
The BuckHickman business was disposed on 10 April 2007.
92 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 19 Financial instruments The Group is exposed to a number of different market risks in the normal course of business including liquidity, credit, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Liquidity risk Established procedures are in place to ensure that the operational and working capital requirements of the Group can be met at all times.
These include: Weekly review, monitoring and forecasting of working capital requirements across Group companies Use of short term, local bank facilities Operation of short term money market dealing lines The implementation and ongoing review of committed multi-currency bank facilities, which are available at short notice.
The Group has 198.1 million of available bilateral banking facilities, which carry a LIBOR based floating rate of interest.
The facilities expire mid-2010, and at 3 February 2008 112.3 million of these facilities were unutilised.
Credit risk The Group has a customer credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis through the use of customer credit limits.
Investments are allowed only in short term instruments and only with counterparties that have sound credit ratings.
The Groups treasury policy stipulates the minimum credit rating that a banking institution must have before deposits can be made.
Given the high credit quality of counterparties with whom the Group has investments, the Directors do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its expectations.
A 3 February 2008 and 28 January 2007 there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset included in the balance sheet.
Hedging interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that it has an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are entered into, where necessary, to achieve this appropriate mix.
At 3 February 2008 the Group was not party to any interest rate swaps 28 January 2007: nil.
At 3 February 2008, if interest rates on foreign currency denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, pre tax profit for the year would have been 0.2 million lower higher 2007: 0.3 m. At 3 February 2008, if interest rates on pound sterling denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, pre tax profit for the year would have been 0.2 million lower higher 2007: 0.1 m. Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the Euro and US dollar.
The Group hedges significant foreign currency exposures in respect of forecast sales and purchases of inventory through foreign exchange contracts.
All such foreign exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year.
The Group does not hedge profit translation exposure, unless there is a corresponding cash flow, since such hedges provide only a temporary deferral of the effects of movement in foreign exchange rates.
Similarly, whilst a significant proportion of the Groups borrowings are denominated in US dollars, the Group does not specifically hedge all of its long term investments in overseas assets.
At 3 February 2008, if the US dollar had weakened strengthened against the pound sterling by one cent, with all other variables held constant, operating profit for the year would have been 0.25 million lower higher, mainly due to the translation of overseas results.
Net assets would not have been significantly different as a result of a similar one cent movement.
At 3 February 2008, if the Euro had weakened strengthened against the pound sterling by one cent, with all other variables held constant, operating profit for the year would have been 0.2 million lower higher, mainly due to the translation of overseas results.
Net assets would have been 0.4 lower higher as a result of a similar one cent movement.
Estimation of fair values The main methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows: Derivatives: forward exchange contracts are marked to market using listed market prices.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings: fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Convertible redeemable preference shares: fair value is based on quoted market prices.
Trade and other receivables payables: the notional amount for trade receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year are deemed to reflect their fair value.
93 Premier Farnell Annual Report & Accounts 2008 19 Financial instruments continued Net fair value of derivative financial instruments The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecast trading transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted trading transactions at 3 February 2008 was 2.9 million 28 January 2007: 0.1 million, which was reflected in a hedging reserve at that date.
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Groups US dollar denominated private placement notes totalling $225 million and unsecured loans of $44 million partially hedge the Groups investment in its US subsidiaries.
The Groups Euro denominated unsecured loans of Euro 10 million partially hedge the Groups investment in its European Union member subsidiaries.
The fair value of the US dollar borrowings at 3 February 2008 was 142.1 million 28 January 2007: 144.0 million and the fair value of the Euro borrowings was 7.5 million 28 January 2007: 19.1 million.
A foreign exchange loss of 0.6 million 28 January 2007: gain of 19.4 million was recognised in equity during the year on translation of these loans to pounds sterling.
Fair value of long-term borrowings and preference shares The book and fair values of the Groups long-term borrowings and preference shares are as follows: Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 2008 2008 2007 2007 m m m m Long-term borrowings 202.8 208.5 199.3 196.6 Preference shares 101.1 78.0 121.5 100.0 The book value of the preference shares at 3 February 2008 comprises the equity element of 15.2 million 2007: 18.4 million and the debt element of 85.9 million 2007: 103.1 million.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group will take in to consideration the amount of dividents paid to shareholders, the level of debt and the number of shares in issue.
When monitoring capital the Group will take into consideration the gearing ratio.
This is calculated as the ratio of net debt to total equity.
Management consider the capital base of the Group to be shareholders equity as show in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings and the debt element of preference shares as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total equity is as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.

The fair value of the net assets acquired, including intangible assets, was not significant, resulting in goodwill arising of 0.9 million.
The historic trading results and cash flows of this business are not significant and the trading results and cashflows of the business in the period since acquisition were negligible due to the acquisition being close to the Groups financial year end.
