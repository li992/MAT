Index 26 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 28 February 2008 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 28 February 2008 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 April 2008.
Whitbread PLC is a public limited company incorporated and fully domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The significant activities of the Group are described in note 4, segment information.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
2 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except when otherwise indicated.
The significant accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associates incorporated within these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company.
Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000 1, which was accounted for using merger accounting, acquisitions by the Group are accounted for under the acquisition method and any goodwill arising is capitalised as an intangible asset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated accounts from or up to the date that control passes respectively.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The income statement for the comparative period has been restated to reflect the disposal of the interest in David Lloyd Leisure Limited, which has been classified as a discontinued operation.
Significant accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
With the exception of overseas trading licences, which are deemed to have an infinite life, intangible assets are amortised over periods of up to 10 years.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment Prior to the 1999 2000 financial year, properties were regularly revalued on a cyclical basis.
Since this date the Group policy has been not to revalue its properties and, while previous valuations have been retained, they have not been updated.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to use the UK GAAP revaluations before the date of transition to IFRS as deemed cost at the date of transition.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold land is not depreciated Freehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years Plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.
Any impairment in the value of property, plant and equipment is charged to the income statement.
Index Directors Report and Accounts 2007 8 27 2 Accounting policies continued Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment reflect the difference between net selling price and the carrying amount at the date of disposal and are recognised in the income statement.
Payments made on entering into or acquiring leaseholds that are accounted for as operating leases represent prepaid lease payments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets cash generating units or CGUs.
If such indication of impairment exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset group is required, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the CGUs recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
For the purposes of impairment testing, all centrally held assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to CGUs based on managements view of the consumption of the asset.
Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally held asset.
Goodwill and intangibles Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at the level management monitor goodwill, which is at strategic business unit level.
The Group performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure that its carrying amount is not greater than its recoverable amount.
In the absence of a comparable recent market transaction that demonstrates that the fair value less costs to sell of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
An impairment is then made to reduce the carrying amount to the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
Property, plant and equipment For the purposes of the impairment review of property, plant and equipment the Group considers CGUs to be each trading outlet.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined with reference to the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the administrative and distribution line items.
Consideration is also given, where appropriate, to the market value of the asset, either from independent sources or in conjunction with an accepted industry valuation methodology.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less any costs of disposal.
Provisions Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts and restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Exceptional items The Group presents on the face of the income statement those items which are separately identified by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
The Group includes the profit or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, property reversions and impairment in exceptional items.
co. uk annualreport0708 Index 28 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 28 February 2008 2 Accounting policies continued Foreign currency translation Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange quoted at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of initial transactions.
Trading results are translated into the functional currency generally sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.
Day to day transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the functional currency at an average rate for the month in which those transactions take place, which is used as a reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement except where they are part of a net foreign investment hedge, in which case translation differences are taken directly to equity.
The differences that arise from translating the results of foreign entities at average rates of exchange, and their assets and liabilities at closing rates, are also dealt with in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
All other currency gains and losses are dealt with in the income statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a euro functional currency.
These are translated into sterling in the Group accounts.
Balance sheet items are translated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date.
Transactions reported in the income statement are translated using an average rate for the month in which they occur.
Revenue recognition Generally, revenue is the value of goods and services sold to third parties as part of the Groups trading activities, after deducting discounts and sales-based taxes.
The following is a description of the composition of revenues of the Group: Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of food and beverages is recognised when they are sold.
Revenue from franchise fees, received in connection with the franchise of the Groups brand names, is recognised when earned.
Royalties Royalties are recognised as the income is earned.
Rendering of services Owned hotel revenue, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales from a network of hotels, is recognised when rooms are occupied and food and beverage is sold.
Finance revenue Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, using the effective interest method.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Rental payments in respect of operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease term.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects which, under the allowed alternative treatment, are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Retirement benefits In respect of defined benefit pension schemes, the obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for any unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
For defined benefit plans, the employers portion of the past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, with the interest cost net of expected return on assets in the plans reported within finance costs.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long-term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Index Directors Report and Accounts 2007 8 29 2 Accounting policies continued Share-based payment transactions Certain employees and directors of the Group receive equity-settled remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value, determined using a stochastic model, at the date at which they are granted.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, and is adjusted to reflect the directors best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
Tax The income tax charge represents both the income tax payable, based on profits for the year, and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, in respect of all temporary timing differences between the tax base of the Groups assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts, that have originated but not been reversed by the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax is recognised if the temporary timing difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary timing differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments which are held by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue, or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Investments in joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are established through an interest in a company a jointly controlled entity.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The recognition of financial assets and liabilities occurs when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The derecognition of financial assets takes place when the Group no longer has the right to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership, or control of the asset.
The derecognition of financial liabilities occurs when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial Assets Available-for-sale financial assets Investments in available-for-sale assets are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments are recognised directly in equity, until the investment is disposed of or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included within finance revenue or costs in the income statement.
If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost and its fair value is transferred from equity to the income statement.
Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are recognised in the income statement, if the loss can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Some assets held by the Group are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
On initial recognition these assets are recognised at fair value.
Subsequent measurement is also at fair value with changes recognised through finance revenue or costs in the income statement.
co. uk annualreport0708 Index 30 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 28 February 2008 2 Accounting policies continued Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative transactions with a view to managing interest risks associated with underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Derivative financial instruments used by the Group are stated at fair value on initial recognition and at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Cash flow hedges hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, it meets the Groups risk management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and it is expected to be highly effective.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Gains or losses from remeasuring fair value hedges, which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, are recorded in the income statement, together with the corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged instruments attributable to the hedged risk.
Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the income statement such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
The portion of any gains or losses of cash flow hedges, which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are determined to be effective hedges, is recognised directly in equity.
The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a firm commitment that is hedged becomes an asset or a liability recognised on the balance sheet, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the transaction that results from a firm commitment that is hedged affects the income statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including a hedge of a monetary item that is accounted for as part of the net investment, are accounted for in a way similar to cash flow hedges.
Gains or losses relating to the effective portion are recognised directly in equity while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement.
On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recognised directly in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of any directly associated issue costs.
Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised cost, with any difference between the amount initially recorded and the redemption value recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates Key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation, at the balance sheet date have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis, and property, plant and equipment where there is indication of impairment.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present values of those cash flows.
The carrying values of goodwill are disclosed in more detail in note 14.
Index Directors Report and Accounts 2007 8 31 2 Accounting policies continued Note 16 describes the assumptions used in impairment testing of property, plant and equipment.
Note 35 describes the assumptions used in accounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Standards issued by the IASB not effective for the current period and not adopted by the Group The following standards and interpretations, which have been issued by the IASB and are relevant for the Group, become effective after the current year end and have not been early adopted by the Group: IFRS 8 Operating segments IFRS 8 was issued in November 2006 and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The standard sets out requirements for disclosure of information about an entitys operating segments, its products and services, the geographical areas in which it operates, and its major customers.
The standard replaces IAS 14, with revised requirements for the identification, measurement and disclosure of segment information.
The impact of this IFRS on the Groups financial statements is not expected to be material.
IAS 23 Borrowing costs A revised IAS 23 was issued in March 2007 and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The standard has been revised to require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to a qualifying asset.
A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale.
This IAS is not expected to have any impact on the Group as interest is already being capitalised under the previously allowed alternative treatment.
IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes IFRIC Interpretation 13 was issued in June 2007 and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008.
This Interpretation requires customer loyalty award credits to be accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction in which they are granted.
Where these award credits are collected on behalf of a third party, they should not be disclosed as revenue.
The Group operates loyalty schemes using a third party but the impact of the change is not expected to be material.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction IFRIC Interpretation 14 was issued in July 2007 and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008.
This Interpretation provides guidance on how to assess the limit on the amount of surplus in a defined benefit scheme that can be recognised as an asset under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The Group expects that this Interpretation will have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group as all defined benefit schemes are currently in deficit.
3 Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: Restated 2007 8 2006 7 m m Rendering of services 527.8 458.5 Royalties 6.3 4.4 Sale of goods 682.6 710.6 Revenue 1,216.7 1,173.5 Finance revenue 11.1 1.9 Total revenue 1,227.8 1,175.4 4 Segment information The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
The Group operates mainly within the UK and as such the secondary format of geographical segments is not presented.
The operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves different markets.
The Group has three core areas of operation: Operation Nature of operation Premier Inn Operation of budget hotels Pub Restaurants Operation of full service and self service pub restaurants Costa Operation of coffee shops Prior year comparatives have been restated to include David Lloyd Leisure Limited as a discontinued operation.
Discontinued operations also include TGI Fridays see note 11.
Inter-segment revenue is from Costa to the other segments.
Transactions were entered into on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Included within unallocated operations are those that are managed by a central division.
The unallocated assets and liabilities are cash and debt balances held and controlled by the central treasury function.

Index Directors Report and Accounts 2007 8 35 6 Exceptional items continued 1.
During the year, the Group sold its interests in David Lloyd Leisure Limited and TGI Fridays.
A review of overheads was subsequently carried out and it was announced that the Pub Restaurants and Hotels divisions would merge and that the shared service teams would be disbanded.
In 2006 7, the disposal of 235 pub restaurants led to a restructuring to reflect the resultant shape of the Group.
Premier Inn rebranding costs relate to asset write-off and brand relaunch costs.
The costs will continue into 2008 9.
Uncertainties in the debt market have put the planned bond issue on hold and the Group has written off the bank and advisory fees associated with this refinancing.
A restructuring provision in respect of the outsourcing of the Groups logistics operation has been created.
This consists of project, redundancy and property related costs.
This is the impact of new arrangements for commutation of pension rights on retirement into cash following a change in government limits.
Exceptional tax relates to significant adjustments to prior year deferred and current tax liabilities.
The associated interest arising on late payment of an item claimed in a previous year, which had been disputed, is included in exceptional interest charges.
This is a combination of a premium paid to debenture holders arising on early redemption and the income from closing out the associated interest rate swaps.

These hotels, which have now been rebranded as Premier Inn, were purchased through the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Golden Tulip UK Limited and Pilot Hotels Limited.
The consideration, which included the discharge of certain existing debt, was paid in cash and loan notes on completion.
In addition to the six trading hotels, the Group acquired secure arrangements on a further nine pipeline sites that will lead to the signing of operating leases on completion of the hotel premises.
From the date of acquisition, the hotels have contributed a loss of 2.7m to the net profit of the Group.
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit for the Group would have been reduced by 2.6m and the revenue from continuing operations would have been increased by 19.2m.
Through its purchase of the former Tulip hotels, the Group has acquired the economic benefits of 771 additional guest bedrooms in the year with a further 1,300 from pipeline sites.

The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted average number of options outstanding during the period.
Where the share price at the year end is lower than the option price the options become anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation.
The number of such options was 320,079 2007: nil.

In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pre-tax discount rate of 9% 2006 7: 9%.
The future cash flows are based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a five year period.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.7% growth rate 2006 7: 2.5%.
Goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at strategic business unit level, being the level at which management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
This is calculated using the five year business plans approved by senior management.
The key assumptions in these calculations relate to revenue and the increase in rooms.
The calculation is most sensitive to revenue assumptions, however senior management believe that the assumptions used are reasonable.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9% 2006 7: 9%.
The resultant impairment review required no impairment of the Premier Inn goodwill carrying value of 60.5m.
A review of the goodwill created by the Tulip and Belgrave acquisitions concluded that there is insufficient post-acquisition trading history to suggest any impairment.
Goodwill acquired will be assessed for impairment as part of the Premier Inn goodwill impairment review in future years.

Other Other provisions relate to warranties given on the disposal of businesses.
These are expected to be used over periods of up to 25 years.
26 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, debentures, cash and short-term deposits.
The Groups financial instrument policies can be found in the accounting policies in note 2.
The Board agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below: Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term sterling debt obligations.
Interest rate swaps are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The Groups policy is to fix between 35% and 65% of projected net interest cost over the next 15 years, which is beyond the life of the Groups existing revolving credit facilities.
This policy reduces the Groups exposure to the consequences of interest rate fluctuations.
At the year end, 492.6m 92% of Group debt was fixed for an average of 5.0 years 2007: 566.3m, 58%, for 6.4 years, using floating rate borrowings and interest rate swaps.
The average rate of interest on this fixed rate debt was 5.7% 2006 7: 5.8%.
During 2007 8, the repayment of borrowings using the cash generated by the disposal of David Lloyd Leisure Limited has resulted in a high level of fixed rate debt.
Based on the 2008 9 budget and the 2009 10 strategic plan, both of which have been approved by the www.
co. uk annualreport0708 Index 50 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 28 February 2008 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Board, the percentage of fixed rate debt will return to the parameters set out in the Groups policy in 2009 10.
Due to the fixing of net debt, the Group would not benefit if interest rates were to fall below the Groups fixed rate.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 28 February 2008 and 1 March 2007 respectively.
Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move: gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in note 2: and cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end, a 1% change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.3m 2007: 4.0m.
Liquidity risk The Group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt.
In its funding strategy the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, bank loans and debentures.
This strategy includes monitoring the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than three months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 28 February 2008 and 1 March 2007 based on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest: Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 More than 28 February 2008 On demand 3 months months years 5 years Total Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 96.0 282.1 5.4 199.4 582.9 Trade payables 98.8 4.4 103.2 96.0 380.9 5.4 203.8 686.1 Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 More than 1 March 2007 On demand 3 months months years 5 years Total Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 86.3 491.4 343.1 920.8 Convertible preference shares 0.1 0.1 Trade payables 110.3 110.3 86.3 110.3 0.1 491.4 343.1 1,031.2 Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with high credit ratings.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required.
The Groups maximum exposure on its trade and other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 21.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial investments and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
Foreign currency risk The disposal of David Lloyd Leisure Limited has significantly reduced the value of the Groups overseas investments, with the result that foreign exchange exposure is currently not significant.
Sensitivity analysis has therefore not been carried out.
Overseas investments are generally start-up businesses undertaken through joint venture arrangements.
The Group monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities as and when they are required.
Capital management The Group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining an appropriate debt equity capital structure.
It uses a number of mechanisms to manage debt equity levels, as appropriate, in the light of economic and trading conditions, and the future capital investment requirements of the business.
Over the last two years these mechanisms have included a combination of special dividends and share buy back to return funds to shareholders.
Index Directors Report and Accounts 2007 8 51 27 Financial instruments Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all the Groups financial instruments.

The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in future cash flows from variable rate debt.
Cash flow hedges are expected to impact on the income statement in line with the liquidity risk table shown in note 26.
The cash flow hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 28 February 2008 and a net unrealised loss of 4.5m was included in equity in respect of these contracts.
Fair value hedges The Group has repaid its debentures and has consequently cancelled the derivatives, which were previously used to hedge the related interest rate risk.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entities Following the disposal of David Lloyd Leisure Limited, including its European operations, the Group has repaid its foreign currency debt.
At 1 March 2007, loans included a borrowing of 63.2m 94m which was designated as a hedge of the net investments in the European subsidiaries and was being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing were transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation on the net investment in subsidiaries when these hedges were effective.

From 2007 the LTIP no longer forms part of the Leadership Group Incentive Scheme.
The LTIP awards shares to directors and senior executives of the Group.
Vesting of shares under the scheme will depend on continued employment and meeting total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS performance targets over a three year period.
Details of the performance targets for the LTIP awards can be seen in the Remuneration report on pages 11 to 19.
The awards are settled in equity once exercised.

The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to continued employment at that date.
If employment ceases prior to the release date by reason of redundancy, retirement, death or disability, the awards will be released in full.
If employment ceases for any other reason, 50% of the shares will be awarded and the remainder will lapse.

No changes will be made to options already granted.
An earnings per share based performance condition will apply to any such options, and to the extent that the performance is not satisfied after three years, the option shall lapse as there is no opportunity to retest performance.
This was the case for the options granted in 2004 and 2005, for which the performance target requires earnings per share growth of RPI plus 12% over the three year performance period.
For options granted between June 2000 and June 2003 the performance conditions required the Companys adjusted earnings per share to exceed RPI plus 4% per annum measured over any three consecutive years out of the 10 year performance period starting from June 2000 and ending June 2013 depending on when the options were granted.

Employee share scheme The employee share save scheme is open to employees with the required minimum period of service and provides for a purchase price equal to the market price on the date of grant, less a 20% discount.
The shares can be purchased over the six month period following the third or fifth anniversary of the commencement date, depending on the length chosen by the employee.

Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT The Company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP and executive share option schemes.
The ESOT held 0.9m shares at 28 February 2008.
All dividends on the shares in the ESOT are waived by the Trustee.
35 Retirement benefits Defined contribution schemes The Group operated a defined contribution pension scheme which closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
Members of the scheme are contracted out of the State Second Pension.
A replacement, contracted-in, defined contribution arrangement was established as a section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund with effect from 1 April 2002.
Contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution schemes, and thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the schemes.
The total cost charged to income in relation to defined contribution schemes in the year was 2.0m 2006 7: 1.9m.
At the year end, 705 employees were active members of the scheme, which also had 6,690 deferred members.
Defined benefit schemes The defined benefit final salary section of the principal Group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
The scheme is funded, and contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
At the year end 1,258 employees were active members of the scheme, which also had 27,961 deferred pensioners and 15,554 pensions in payment.
The pension cost relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from Lane Clark & Peacock and Hewitt, using the projected unit credit valuation basis.
As the scheme is now closed to new members the current service cost, under the projected unit credit valuation basis, will increase as a percentage of salary as members of the scheme approach retirement, although the overall cost will decrease as the number of members decreases.
co. uk annualreport0708 Index 58 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 28 February 2008 35 Retirement benefits continued Actuarial valuations of the schemes are carried out on a triennial basis, with the next valuation for Whitbread Group Pension Fund due in 2008.
The pension cost for the year has been based on the last actuarial valuation, which was carried out as at 31 March 2005.
The assumptions were derived from market yields.
Separate assumptions were made for the discount rate used to value liabilities and the return expected on the assets.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
In order to reflect changes to life expectancy since the last valuation, the results of the Funds mortality experience at 31 March 2005 have this year been applied to the 00 series base table and future rates of improvement in life expectancy are assumed to be in line with medium cohort projections, with a minimum annual improvement of 1% per annum.
The Board announced in April 2003 that the Company had signed an agreement with Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited.
This agreement was updated in October 2005.
Under the agreement, the Company has given undertakings to the trustees similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to a value of 300.0m.
As a consequence of the agreement, during the year ended 28 February 2008, ordinary contributions of 5.5m for future service, plus 50.0m of special contributions, were paid by Whitbread Group PLC into the Fund.
The Group expects to make special contributions of a further 90.0m over the next three years including 50.0m during the financial year 2008 9 and 20.0m during each of the financial years 2009 10 and 2010 11.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuations of the UK schemes to 28 February 2008 for IAS 19 purposes were: At At 28 February 1 March 2008 2007 % % Rate of increase in salaries 5.0 4.5 Pre April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.4 3.0 Post April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.4 2.3 Discount rate 6.2 5.2 Inflation assumption 3.4 3.0 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 18.9 years if they are male and for a further 21.3 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2028 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 20.7 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 23.1 years after retirement if they are female.
The main valuation assumptions were that the return on investments would be 3.5% per annum above inflation.
The average expected remaining service life of current employees is seven years.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2007 8 2006 7 m m Current service cost 5.5 7.5 Past service cost 10.0 1.5 Curtailments 0.5 1.0 Recognised in arriving at operating profit 5.0 5.0 Expected return on scheme assets 86.5 73.0 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 79.5 73.5 Other finance revenue costs note 8 7.0 0.5 The amounts taken to the statement of recognised income and expense are as follows: 2007 8 2006 7 m m Actual return on scheme assets 20.0 82.5 Less: expected return on scheme assets 86.5 73.0 Other actuarial gains and losses 162.0 28.5 95.5 38.0 Index Directors Report and Accounts 2007 8 59 35 Retirement benefits continued The current and past service cost has been included in administrative expenses.

The main reasons for this reduction are actuarial gains of 95.5m reflected in the statement of recognised income and expense, a special cash contribution from the Group of 50.0m and an exceptional profit reflected in the income statement of 10.0m relating to new arrangements for commutation of pension rights on retirement into a cash lump sum.
