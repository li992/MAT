Notes to tHe FiNANciAL stAteMeNts 1 Segmental analysis the Groups primary segment reporting is by business sector with geographical reporting being the secondary format.
the business sectors within continuing operations consist of Banking, treasury & capital Markets tcM, Healthcare and central services.
previously Banking and tcM were managed and reported together as Banking.

Details of the Long-term incentive plan Ltip, the Misys senior executive Bonus plan MseBp, the Misys 1998 Unapproved share option plan type i and the transformation incentive plan tip are shown in the Directors Remuneration report.
in the years ended 31 May 2007 and 31 May 2008, grants under the Misys share Award plan MsAp were made to senior managers at nil cost.
the sharesave schemes provide for a yearly award of options at a discount to the market price and are eligible to all Group employees.
in the tables below similar share-based payment arrangements have been aggregated as follows: share option schemes nil cost: includes Ltip, MsAp, MseBp, tip nil cost and restricted stock units contract.
share option schemes market value: includes type i, and tip market value.
savings-related share option schemes: includes the sharesave UK and sharesave non UK schemes.
Share-based payment charges share-based payment charges are calculated by spreading the fair value of an option over the vesting period having taken into account any performance conditions when estimating the number of options expected to vest.
the vesting period is typically three years from date of grant or the beginning of the bonus year in respect of grants under the MseBp.
All options are valued using the Black-scholes option pricing model except grants under the Ltip and tip which use the Monte carlo option pricing model as they have market performance conditions which are included in the fair value calculation.
the following assumptions have been used in the option pricing models: 2008 2007 2006 Risk-free interest rate % 3.8 5.8 4.6 5.0 4.1 4.2 Dividend yield % 0 3.3 3.2 3.3 1 Volatility of Misys plc ordinary shares %: share option schemes nil cost 23 40 33 37 47 share option schemes market value 40 51 37 56 61 savings-related share option schemes 32 36 34 36 47 Expected lives years of options granted under: share option schemes nil cost 0.6 3.2 3 3 share option schemes market value 4.3 6.5 5 6.5 6.5 savings-related share option schemes 3.1 3.4 3 3 1 expected volatility was calculated using the share price history for the period equivalent to the expected life.

cash flows for each cGU were based on approved budgets which are consistent with the recent financial performance of the relevant cGU.
it was not necessary to look at cash flows beyond five years as cash flows within this time horizon were significantly in excess of the carrying amounts of the cGUs and hence the calculation is not sensitive to the discount rate used.
the goodwill held in the Hospital systems cGU was disposed of during the year as part of the disposal of that business see note 4. the goodwill relating to sesame of 18.7m was transferred to assets held for sale in the prior year and is therefore not included in the net book value of goodwill at 1 June 2007.

As set out in note 30 of the Financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2007 the Group had applied to the iRs to correct a number of administrative errors in the operation of part of the Us defined contribution pension schemes.
the iRs issued a compliance statement on 21 september 2007 in respect of this issue, the implementation of which was due by 21 February 2008.
Misys believes the matters covered by the administrative errors notified to the iRs have been concluded.
this was done without material cost to the Group.
the Groups subsidiaries and the company can be parties to legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
Whilst the outcome of current outstanding actions and claims remains uncertain, it is expected that they will be resolved without a material impact to the Groups financial position.

As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the Group uses derivative financial instruments.
in accordance with the Groups treasury policy, derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, instrument types, transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
the Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash, short-term deposits, bank loans, overdrafts, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.
the main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
Foreign exchange risk the Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the euro and the Us dollar.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investment in foreign operations.
Management has established a policy requiring Group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.
the Group companies must manage their exposure to exchange differences both recognised and anticipated.
the Group companies are required to hedge any significant transactions which create foreign exchange exposures with Group treasury when a transaction becomes a contractual commitment to pay or receive funds at a future date.
the Group defines a significant transaction as any individual or series of transactions that are in excess of the equivalent of 50,000 in any currency.
Group treasury reviews these exposures on a regular basis.
to manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, the entities in the Group use forward currency contracts transacted with Group treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
external foreign exchange contracts are designated at Group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.
the consolidated foreign exchange exposure of Group treasury activities will be hedged by Group treasury within limits specified in the Group treasury policy.
the Groups net exposure to foreign currency risk is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in note 40.

the Groups borrowings are primarily at variable interest rates set for periods of six months or less.
Based on the various scenarios, the Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using interest rate caps which are used to protect the Group against significant increases in interest rates.
Under the interest rate caps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals primarily quarterly, the difference between the specified exercise rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
the Groups cash balances are kept in interest bearing current accounts and on short-term deposit to maximise the level of return while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity.
the Group does not invest surplus funds in long-term fixed interest securities and therefore its exposure to fair value interest rate risk is not significant.
the Groups net exposure to interest rate risk is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in note 40. Credit risk credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions but primarily from outstanding trade receivables and committed transactions.
the Group has policies in place to ensure that sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative and cash transactions are limited to high-quality financial institutions.
the Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
A maximum investment threshold has been set for investments with a single counterparty based on its investment rating.
For customer contracts, the Group and each reporting subsidiary have specified risk control and authorisation procedures in place to assess the credit quality of a customer.
Where there is no independent risk rating for a customer, such an assessment takes into account financial position, past experience and other factors.
the Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk, with exposures spread over a large number of customers and counterparties.
liquidity risk the Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within risk parameters set by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of the business.
the forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.

in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
