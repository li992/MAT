IFRS 3 Revised Business combinations was issued in January 2008 and will apply to business combinations arising from 1st January 2010.
Amongst other changes, the new Standard will require recognition of subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in the income statement rather than against goodwill, and transaction costs to be recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value gains or losses on existing investments in an acquired company will be recognised in the income statement at the date of acquisition.
IAS 27 Revised Consolidated and separate financial statements was issued in January 2008 and will be implemented at the same time as IFRS 3 Revised.
In respect of transactions with non-controlling interests in Group entities that do not result in a change of control, the revised Standard requires that the difference between the consideration paid or received and the recorded non-controlling interest is recognised in equity.
In the case of divestment of a subsidiary, any retained interest will be remeasured to fair value and the difference between fair value and the previous carrying value will be recognised immediately in the income statement.
IFRS 3 Revised and IAS 27 Revised will both be applied prospectively to transactions occurring after the implementation date.
It is therefore not possible to assess in advance their impact on the financial statements of the Group.

A significant expansion of the Operational Excellence programme was approved by the Board and announced in February 2009.
Total costs for the implementation of the expanded programme are expected to be approximately 3.6 billion, to be incurred over the period from 2007 to 2011.
Approximately 40% of these costs were incurred by 31st December 2008, and approximately 35% are expected to be incurred in 2009, 20% in 2010 and the balance mostly in 2011.
In total, approximately 75% of these costs are expected to be cash expenditures and 25% are expected to be accounting write-downs.
Uncertainties exist over the exact amount and timing of cash outflows as a result of potential future exchange rate fluctuations and as many elements of the restructuring programme are subject to employee consultation procedures, making it difficult to predict with precision when these procedures will be completed.
However, the majority of the remaining cash payments are expected to be made in 2009 and 2010.
The programme is expected to deliver total annual pre-tax savings of up to 1.7 billion by 2011, with savings realised across the business.
Costs of 1,084 million incurred in 2008 under the Operational Excellence programme have arisen in the following areas: the commencement of the closure of a number of manufacturing sites, including Dartford and Crawley in the UK and Cidra in Puerto Rico, giving rise to asset write-downs, staff reductions and a foreign exchange loss on the liquidation of a subsidiary: the adoption of more customised sales approaches, leading to staff reductions in a number of sales forces, principally in the USA: cost saving projects in R&D, focused primarily on the simplification and streamlining of support infrastructure, and projects to eliminate unnecessary processes and simplify continuing processes, leading to staff reductions in administrative and support functions.
In addition, costs of 34 million were incurred during the year under the restructuring programme related to the integration of the Reliant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. business in the USA, following its acquisition in December 2007.

The Group operates in countries where the tax rate differs from the UK tax rate.
The impact of these overseas taxes on the overall rate of tax is shown above.
Profits arising from certain operations in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland are accorded special status and are taxed at reduced rates compared with the normal rates of tax in these territories.
The effect of this reduction in the taxation charge increased earnings per share by 2.8p in 2008, 4.9p in 2007 and 7.2p in 2006.
The Group is required under IFRS to create a deferred tax asset in respect of unrealised intercompany profit arising on inventory held by the Group at the year-end by applying the tax rate of the country in which the inventory is held rather than the tax rate of the country where the profit was originally made and the tax paid, which is the practice under UK and US GAAP.
As a result of this difference in accounting treatment the Group tax rate under IFRS increased by 2.1% in 2008 2007 0.8% decrease, 2006 1.9% decrease arising from changes in work-in-progress and finished goods.
The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Resolution of such issues is a continuing fact of life for GSK.
The Groups main open tax issues are in the USA, Canada and Japan.
In July, following discussions with HMRC, the Group settled substantially all outstanding UK tax issues for all periods up to and including 31st December 2006.
Following its audit of the period 2001 to 2003, the IRS issued Statutory Notices of Deficiency to GSK asserting income and withholding tax deficiencies, and associated penalties, arising from its reclassification of an intercompany financing arrangement in those years from debt to equity, and its consequent recharacterisation of the amounts paid as dividends subject to withholding tax under the US UK treaty.
All amounts due under the financing arrangement were paid on a timely basis, with the final payment made in April 2008.
The IRS commenced its audit of the period 2004 to 2006 in June 2008 and is examining the issue for these years.
GSK disagrees with the IRS position and, in August 2008, initiated actions in the United States Tax Court to contest the Statutory Notices of Deficiency.
GSK estimates that the IRS claim for tax, penalties, and interest at 31st December 2008, net of federal tax relief, for 2001 to 2003 is $864 million.
GSK believes that this claim has no merit and that no adjustment is warranted.
If, contrary to GSKs view, the IRS prevailed in its argument before a court in respect of the years 2001 to 2003, GSK would expect to have an additional liability for the five year period 2004-2008 in the amount of $1,059 million in tax, penalties, and interest at 31st December 2008, net of federal tax relief for those years.
In the event that the company is not able to resolve this issue with the IRS, a court decision would not be expected before 2011.
GSK Annual Report 2008 123 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Taxation continued Lower courts in Japan have upheld claims by the tax authorities for Yen 39 billion 177 million relating to Japanese CFC legislation.
The company has paid and fully provided for the full tax but is pursuing a claim for refund to the Japanese Supreme Court.
In Canada a court decision in respect of transfer pricing in the early 1990s was completed in May 2008.
GSK filed an appeal in June and a court date is awaited.
GSK continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from open assessments.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings and negotiations with the relevant tax authorities.
No provision has been made for taxation which would arise on the distribution of profits retained by overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings, on the grounds that no remittance of profit retained at 31st December 2008 is required in such a way that incremental tax will arise.
The aggregate amount of these unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately 28 billion 2007 31 billion.

Of these losses, 142 million 2007 139 million are due to expire between 20092019, 357 million 2007 327 million are due to expire between 20202028 and 67 million 2007 28 million are available indefinitely.
At 31st December 2008, the Group had not recognised any deferred tax asset in respect of income tax losses of approximately 4,526 million 2007 3,688 million, of which 37 million 2007 62 million are due to expire between 20092019, 66 million 2007 45 million are due to expire between 20202028 and 4,423 million 2007 3,581 million which are available indefinitely.
The Group had capital losses at 31st December 2008 of approximately 5 billion in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise losses.

Adjusted earnings per share is calculated using results before major restructuring earnings.
The calculation of results before major restructuring is described in Note 1 Presentation of the financial statements.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated after adjusting the weighted average number of shares used in the basic calculation to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares.
A potentially dilutive share forms part of the employee share schemes where its exercise price is below the average market price of GSK shares during the period and any performance conditions attaching to the scheme have been met at the balance sheet date.

Some lease agreements include renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses.
GSK Annual Report 2008 127 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 17 Property, plant and equipment continued The impairment losses principally arise from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs to sell or value in use.
The value in use calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash flows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country specific risks.
Where an impairment is indicated and a pre-tax cash flow calculation is expected to give a materially different result, the test would be reperformed using pre-tax cash flows and a pre-tax discount rate.
The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of approximately 11%.
The impairment losses have been charged through cost of sales 209 million, R&D 47 million and SG&A 10 million, and include 197 million 2007 106 million arising from the major restructuring programmes.
Reversals of impairment arise from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original impairments are deemed no longer to apply.
All of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales.

See Note 38, Acquisitions and disposals for further details.
The carrying value of goodwill, translated at year-end exchange rates, is made up of balances arising on acquisition of the following companies: 2008 2007 Cash generating unit m m Reliant Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The valuations of the Worldwide Pharmaceuticals cash generating unit for Sirtris Pharmaceuticals and Domantis and the US Pharmaceuticals cash generating unit for Reliant Pharmaceuticals have both been prepared on a fair value less costs to sell basis, using turnover and earnings multiples derived from observed market data.
In each case the value of goodwill inherent in the cash generating units is considerably in excess of the book values of the acquired goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of the other cash generating units are assessed using either a value in use or a fair value less costs to sell model.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated.
Initially a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash flows.
The post-tax discount rate used is based on the Group WACC of 8%, as most cash generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group.
The discount rate is increased where specific country risks are sufficiently significant to have a material impact on the outcome of the impairment test.
Where the impairment test indicates that the recoverable value of the unit is close to or below its carrying value, it is reperformed using a pre-tax discount rate and pre-tax cash flows in order to determine if an impairment exists and to establish its magnitude.
Fair value is calculated using a similar discounted cash flow approach based on the Groups acquisition valuation model.
A post-tax discount rate is applied to the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash flows and terminal value.
Details relating to the discounted cash flow models used in the impairment tests of the other significant goodwill balances are as follows: Vaccines CGU Japan Pharmaceuticals CGU Consumer Healthcare CGU Poland Pharmaceuticals CGU for ID Biomedical for GlaxoSmithKline KK for CNS for Polfa Poznan Valuation basis Fair value less costs to sell Fair value less costs to sell Fair value less costs to sell Value in use Key assumptions Sales growth rates Sales growth rates Sales growth rates Sales growth rates Profit margins Profit margins Advertising and Profit margins Discount rate Discount rate promotion investment Discount rate Terminal growth rate Determination of Growth rates are internal Growth rates are internal Growth rates are internal Growth rates are internal assumptions forecasts based on both forecasts based on both forecasts based on both forecasts based on both internal and external internal and external internal and external internal and external market information.

The terminal growth rate used in the value in use calculation for the Poland Pharmaceuticals CGU reflects the impact of future generic competition and takes no account of new product launches.
The Consumer Healthcare cash generating unit comprises a collection of smaller cash generating units including brands with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 1,794 million 2007 1,332 million as detailed in Note 19 Other intangible assets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.

At 31st December 2008, the net book value included 795 million arising from the acquisition of Reliant Pharmaceuticals Inc. in 2007 and 654 million arising from the acquisition of ID Biomedical Corporation in 2005.
It also included 132 million 2007 136 million of internally generated costs of which 125 million 2007 130 million related to computer software and 7 million 2007 6 million related to compounds in development.
Amortised brands include OTC rights relating to alli, with a book value at 31st December 2008 of 294 million 2007 249 million.
Indefinite life brands comprise a portfolio of Consumer Healthcare products acquired with the acquisitions of Sterling Winthrop, Inc. in 1994, Block Drug Company, Inc. in 2001 and CNS, Inc. in 2006.

The brands are in relatively similar stable and profitable market sectors, with similar risk profiles, and their size, diversification and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factor which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment applying a fair value less costs to sell methodology, generally using four year post-tax cash flow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and a discount rate equal to the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country-specific risks.
The main assumptions include future sales price and volume growth, product contribution and the future expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdictions.
These assumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition.
The terminal growth rates applied of between 2% and 3% are managements estimates of future long-term average growth rates of the relevant markets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of these brands.

The investment had a book value at 31st December 2008 of 463 million 2007 299 million and a market value of 1,316 million 2007 970 million.
Although the Group holds less than 20% of the ownership interest and voting control in Quest, the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence through both its significant shareholding and its nominated directors active participation on the Quest Board of Directors and Board sub-committees.
The transfers from other investments relates to the Groups holding in Chemocentryx, previously classified within Other investments, which increased during the year to 23.5%.
Summarised balance sheet information in respect of the Groups associates is set out below: 2008 2007 m m Total assets: Quest Diagnostics Inc. 5,836 4,305 Others 115 37 5,951 4,342 Total liabilities: Quest Diagnostics Inc. 3,333 2,634 Others 20 3,353 2,634 Net assets 2,598 1,708 Groups share of associates net assets 524 314 In 2002, GSK hedged part of the equity value of its holding in Quest Diagnostics Inc. through a series of variable sale forward contracts.
The contracts the equity collar were renewed in 2006 and were structured in five series, each over two million Quest shares, and were due to mature between 2010 and 2012.
A second series of hedging contracts over an additional 10 million shares was entered into on 15th February 2007.
These contracts were also structured in five series, each over two million Quest shares, and were due to mature between 2013 and 2015.
During the year, these contracts held with Lehman Brothers Finance S. A. with respect to a total of 20 million Quest shares terminated with no material financial impact to GSK.
Investments in joint ventures comprise 36 million share of gross assets 2007 21 million and 8 million share of gross liabilities 2007 6 million.
These principally arise from 50% interests in two joint ventures,  Holdings, L. P. which is developing specified chemical compounds, and GlaxoSmithKline Shire Canada, which primarily co-markets Combivir, Trizivir and Epivir in certain territories, together with a 29% interest in another joint venture, Pharmaceutical Insurance Limited, which is a mutual insurance company covering pharmaceutical property risk.

For investments traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange quoted bid price.
For other investments, the fair value is estimated by reference to the current market value of similar instruments or by reference to the discounted cash flows of the underlying net assets.
Equity investments are recorded as non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year, in which case they are recorded as current assets.
The Group holds a number of equity investments in entities where the Group has entered into research collaborations.
Other investments include listed investments of 319 million 2007 413 million that offer the Group the opportunity for return through dividend income and fair value gains.
On disposal of investments, fair value movements are reclassified from reserves to the income statement based on average cost for shares acquired at different times.
The impairment losses recorded in the tables above have been recognised in the income statement for the year within other operating income, together with amounts recycled from the fair value reserve on recognition of the impairments.
These impairments initially result from prolonged or significant declines in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the income statement.
At 31st December 2008 impaired assets with a fair value of 118 million 2007 90 million are included in other investments.

Provisions are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reflect the final outcome and the amounts are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of provision is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the provisions are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits can be provided by state schemes: by defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee: or by defined benefit schemes, whereby retirement benefits are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some hybrid defined benefit schemes also include defined contribution sections.
GSK Annual Report 2008 135 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued Pension costs of defined benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been calculated using the projected unit method.
In certain countries pension benefits are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised through the statement of recognised income and expense.
The UK and US discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields and are intended to reflect the term of the expected benefit payments.
The expected rate of return on bonds reflects the portfolio mix of index-linked, government and corporate bonds.
An equity risk premium of between 3% and 4% is added to longer term government bond yields to give the expected rate of return on equities.
Projected inflation rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and fixed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting the PA92 standard mortality tables to reflect recent scheme experience.
These rates are then projected to reflect improvements in life expectancy in line with the medium cohort i. e. improvements at recently observed higher levels which are assumed to continue to 2020 with minimum improvements thereafter of 1% per year for males and 0.5% for females.
In the USA, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2000 fully generational table, projected using scale AA, with the white collar adjustment.
The mortality assumptions for the UK and US schemes were reviewed in 2007 and updated in 2008.
GSK expects to review these again in 2009.
The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2028 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK USA Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 26.8 28.1 24.5 26.2 Projected for 2028 29.3 30.0 25.9 27.0 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts or are insurance contracts.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversified to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
Following an asset liability study in 2007, the Group decided to adopt a strategy to reduce gradually the allocation of investment in equities.
In the UK it is proposed that the strategy will be linked to the funding levels in the schemes and this will be considered further with the trustees of the UK schemes in 2009.
The target allocation of equities and property in the US scheme was reduced from 80% of the total to 60% in 2008.
In the UK the defined benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a defined contribution scheme.

The liability for the US post-retirement healthcare scheme has been assessed using the same assumptions as for the US pension scheme, together with the assumption for future medical inflation of 9.0% 2007 8.5%, reducing by 0.5% per year to 5% in 2017 and thereafter.
During 2007, the US post-retirement healthcare scheme was amended.
The main change was an increase in the cap on company costs.
At 31st December 2008 the US plan obligation was 1,223 million 2007 879 million: 2006 927 million.
However, in accordance with IAS 19 the unvested part of a benefit improvement is not recognised immediately on the balance sheet but is recognised gradually through the income statement.
At 31st December 2008, the unrecognised amount of 51 million primarily relates to the effect of this change in the US post-retirement scheme.
At 31st December 2007, the past service cost not recognised from this scheme amounted to 47 million.

In 2006, GSK formalised an agreement with the trustees of the UK defined benefit pension schemes to make additional contributions each year in addition to the normal contributions, over a four-year period ending 31st December 2009 in order to eliminate the then pension deficits in the funded schemes on an IAS 19 basis.
GSK has also committed to eliminate any future deficits that arise over a rolling five-year period.
This agreement will be reviewed during 2009.
Employer contributions for 2009, including special funding contributions, are estimated to be approximately 900 million in respect of defined benefit pension schemes and 55 million in respect of post-retirement benefits.

Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analyses are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in relevant foreign exchange and interest rates.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar, Euro and Yen financial instruments excluding obligations under finance leases and certain non-derivative financial instruments not in net debt and which do not present a material exposure.
These three currencies are the major currencies in which GSKs financial instruments are denominated.
GSK has considered movements in these currencies over the last three years and has concluded that a 20% movement in rates is a reasonable benchmark.
In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates where they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Intercompany loans which are fully hedged to maturity with a currency swap have been excluded from this analysis.
2008 2007 Increase decrease Reduction Increase decrease Reduction in income in equity in income in equity m m m m 20% appreciation 2007 10% appreciation of the US dollar 210 991 38 580 20% appreciation 2007 10% appreciation of the Euro 20 1,760 10 709 20% appreciation 2007 10% appreciation of the Yen 1 52 15 A 20% 2007 10% depreciation of the stated currencies would have an equal and opposite effect.
The movements in the income statement relate primarily to hedging instruments for US dollar legal provisions, trade payables and trade receivables.
Whilst these are economic hedges, the provisions are not financial instruments and therefore are not included in the table above.
The sensitivity of these hedging instruments would be insignificant if the provisions were included.
The movements in equity relate to foreign exchange positions used to hedge Group assets denominated in US dollar, Euro and Yen.
Therefore, a depreciation on the currency swap would give rise to a corresponding appreciation on the Group asset.
Foreign exchange sensitivity on Group assets other than financial instruments is not included above.
162 GSK Annual Report 2008 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued continued 41 Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Interest rate sensitivity The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to interest rates on its floating rate Sterling, US dollar and Euro financial instruments, being the currencies in which GSK has historically issued debt and held investments.
GSK has considered movements in these interest rates over the last three years and has concluded that a 2% increase is a reasonable benchmark.
Debt with a maturity of less than one year is floating rate for this calculation.
A 2% movement in interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity.
2008 2007 Increase decrease Increase decrease in income in income m m 2% increase 2007 1% increase in Sterling interest rates 16 1 2% increase 2007 1% increase in US dollar interest rates 13 16 2% increase 2007 1% increase in Euro interest rates 4 3 A 2% 2007 1% decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect, with the exception of US dollar, where interest rates could not be decreased by 2% as they are currently less than 0.5%.
The maximum decrease in income would therefore be limited to 1 million.
Interest rate movements on obligations under finance leases, foreign currency and interest rate derivatives, trade payables, trade receivables and other financial instruments not in net debt do not present a material exposure to the Groups balance sheet based on a 2% increase or decrease in these interest rates.
Contractual cash flows for non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative instruments The following is an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows including interest payable for the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis.
For the purpose of this table, debt is defined as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under finance leases.
Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31st December without taking account of future issuance.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31st December.
