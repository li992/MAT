Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2008 16 Goodwill continued The most recent financial budgets approved by the management have been prepared after considering the most recent economic environment which has resulted in more conservative estimates about the future.
At 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007, the carrying amounts of goodwill for CGUs were tested for impairment and deemed not to be impaired.
These were calculated based on future projected cash flows discounted at rates as disclosed above, which represented the Groups weighted average cost of capital plus a premium for risk.
The pre-tax weighted average cost of capital for the Group at 31 December 2008 was estimated as 7.9% 2007: 8.20%.
Management has undertaken a sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions arising from a range of possible future trading and economic scenarios.
This scenario has been performed separately for each CGU with the sensitivities summarised as follows: An increase in WACC by 2% points.
A decrease of between 3-10% depending on the CGU on forecast operating profits in the next 5 years.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairments would result under the above sensitivity scenarios.
Those CGUs which had the lowest level of headroom in this analysis related to our events businesses, which predominantly concentrate on the Financial Service sector.
If the economic environment surrounding this sector continues to decline throughout 2009, the effect of which would erode the customer base further, there may be the possibility of a future impairment.
Management will conduct regular reviews to monitor this.
