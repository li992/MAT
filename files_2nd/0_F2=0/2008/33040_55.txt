Specic items The group separately identies and discloses significant one off or unusual items termed specic items.
This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and we believe assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group.
A denition of specic items is provided in the accounting policies section on page 88.
