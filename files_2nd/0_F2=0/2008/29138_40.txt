During the year no Director was interested in any contract or other matter requiring disclosure under section 232 of the Companies Act 1985.
20 Contingencies, Guarantees and Financial Commitments At the year end the Company had a contingent liability amounting to 10 million 2007 10 million under a subscription agreement relating to participating loan notes.
The obligation will expire on 31 December 2010.
21 Contingent Asset In June 2007 the European Court of Justice ruled that investment trust management fees should be exempt from VAT and this decision has now been accepted by HM Revenue and Customs.
The result of this decision is that future management fees will not be subject to VAT and the Company will be able to recover some of the VAT incurred on past management fees.
A number of procedural matters remain to be resolved however before certainty is reached in respect of the amount of VAT that will be repaid.
Consequently, no amounts have been recognised as an asset within these Accounts.
The amount recoverable however will not be material and, for the period from 2000 to 2007, is expected to be about 0.2% of shareholders funds.
22 Summary of Main Investment Restrictions as incorporated within the Investment Management Agreement between the Company and Baillie Gifford & Co Holding size At the time of investment, a maximum of 8% of total assets may be invested in any one holding.
This restriction does not apply to investment in collective investment schemes, issues by way of rights or certain government bonds.
A maximum of 40% of total assets may be invested in holdings exceeding 3% of the value of the Companys total assets.
Again, this restriction does not apply to collective investment schemes, issues by way of rights or certain government bonds.
Categories of investment No investment shall be made on which there is unlimited liability.
The Managers must seek permission of the Board to invest in collective investment schemes managed by Baillie Gifford & Co.
Transactions in futures and options must be consistent with HM Revenue and Customs guidelines so as to ensure maintenance of the Companys Investment Trust status.
23 Financial Instruments As an Investment Trust, the Company invests in equities and makes other investments so as to achieve its investment objective of maximising total return, whilst also generating real dividend growth, from a focused and actively managed global portfolio.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with the financial instruments and markets in which it invests.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent loss of capital rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
Risk provides the potential for both loss and gains and in assessing risk, the Board encourages the Managers to exploit the opportunities that risk affords.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
