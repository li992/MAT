In accordance with the rules of the plans the model simulates BPs TSR and compares it against our principal strategic competitors over the three-year period of the plans.
The model takes into account the historic dividends, share price volatilities and covariances of BP and each comparator company to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
This is applied to the reward criteria to give an expected value of the TSR element.
Accounting expense does not necessarily represent the actual value of share-based payments made to recipients, which are determined by the remuneration committee according to established criteria.
A restructuring was announced in October 2007, the implementation of which continues in 2009. b Includes 21,200 2007 24,500 and 2006 26,100 service station staff.
c A minor amendment has been made to the comparative figures to include some employee costs which had been previously incorrectly excluded and to correct headcount data.
