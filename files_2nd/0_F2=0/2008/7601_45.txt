The fair value of other financial instruments, that are not traded in an active market, is determined by using standard valuation techniques, predominantly based on discounted cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by the deviation in future expected cash flows calculated by reference to the movement in market quoted exchange rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on their future cash flows, projected using the yield curve at the balance sheet date and discounted using rates determined from the relevant curve.
The fair values of interest rate caps, foreign exchange options and interest rate swap options are based on the Blacks financial model.
The carrying values of available for sale unlisted investments are based on the Directors best estimate of fair value.
The fair values of non-sterling denominated financial instruments are translated into sterling using the year end exchange rate.
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS Hunting PLCs activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk including currency risk, fair value interest risk, cash flow interest risk and commodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups risk management strategy seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge its risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest rate exposures, cash management and the investment of surplus cash.

FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS continued The Groups treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk management.
It is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating companies.
a Foreign exchange risk Hunting PLCs international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, particularly in respect of US dollars.
Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Groups local operations.
i Transactional risk The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options and currency swaps.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments of highly probable forecast transactions.
Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling twelve month cash flow forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified.
Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a twelve month period are also identified.
The currency flows to be hedged are currently set at 250,000 equivalent for monthly transactions and 500,000 equivalent for annual transactions.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the following year.
The table excludes available for sale financial assets, derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge and loans to subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the net investment in a foreign operation, as exchange differences arising on these are recognised directly in equity.

FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS continued ii Translational risk Foreign exchange risk also arises from Hunting PLCs investments in foreign operations.
Average rate options are used to reduce translation risk on the Groups consolidated profit before tax by hedging the translation of approximately 50% of budgeted US dollar earnings into sterling.
These derivatives are not designated as a hedge.
b Interest rate risk Cash deposits or borrowings at variable interest rates expose the Group to cash flow risk.
The Groups policy is to minimise interest costs and changes in the market value of debt.
Prior to the receipt of Gibson Energy sale proceeds and the elimination of debt, interest expense was hedged using interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, forward rate agreements and currency swaps.
c Commodity price risk The Group was previously exposed to changes in the price of oil, gas and electricity commodities.
Oil and gas price futures and swaps were used to hedge the exposure to oil and gas price movements.
Following the sale of Gibson Energy during the year, the Group is no longer exposed to these commodity price risks.
d Credit risk The Groups credit risk arises from its cash and cash equivalents, deposits, derivative financial instruments and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties.
Credit risk exposure is continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Financing transactions are with leading financial institutions, which have Fitch long-term ratings between A and AA, and no losses are expected from non-performance of these counterparties.
Surplus funds are only invested with financial institutions approved by the Board.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into.
Approved institutions all have a minimum of an A1, P1 or F1 short-term rating and AAA rating for Money Market Funds from Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch rating agencies.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set for each counterparty.
Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored.
Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the customer and past experience through trading relationships.
To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.
The majority of the Companys defined benefit section of the UK Scheme is now covered by insurance company annuity policies, meaning the pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated.
The pension buy-in has been affected by using three insurers, so as to spread its credit risk.
The credit ratings of these insurers is monitored.

FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS continued e Liquidity risk The Group has sufficient net cash and credit facilities to meet both its long and short-term requirements.
The credit facilities totalled 194.4m 2007 269.6m and comprise 142.5m 2007 207.7m of committed facilities and 51.9m 2007 61.9m of uncommitted facilities.
All of these facilities are unsecured and are provided by a variety of funding sources.
The committed facilities comprise a 125m multi-currency loan facility from a syndicate of five banks and two bilateral facilities totalling 17.5m.
The 125m multi-currency loan facility expires on 22 September 2010.
A commitment fee of 0.15% is payable on the undrawn amount.
The two bilateral facilities mature on 14 December 2009 and 31 March 2010.
Commitment fees payable on the undrawn amount range from 0.2% to 0.26%.
The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at the year end: 2008 2007 m m Floating rate: Expiring within one year 7.5 Expiring between one and two years 135.0 12.4 Expiring between two and five years 28.1 142.5 40.5 Surplus funds have been placed in short-term deposits with approved banks and with AAA rated Money Market Funds.
Set out below are maturity analyses of the Groups and Companys financial liabilities at the year end which will be settled on a net basis.
The maturity dates are the contractual maturities of the financial liabilities and the amounts are the contractual, undiscounted cash flows.
The carrying amounts in the balance sheet are the discounted amounts.
Balances due within one year have been included in the maturity analysis at their carrying amounts, as the impact of discounting is not significant.

FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS continued The table below analyses the Groups derivative financial instruments that will be settled on a gross basis into maturity groupings based on the period remaining from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual, undiscounted cash flows.
2008 On demand or within one year m Forward foreign exchange contracts held for trading inflows 58.9 outflows 63.1 2007 On demand or within one year m Funding swaps held for trading inflows 34.1 outflows 34.0 Forward foreign exchange contracts held for trading inflows 26.8 outflows 26.7 f Sensitivity analysis The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Groups and Companys financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2008.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net cash, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the cash and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2008.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions but including onerous leases and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Groups results, that is, an increase in rates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.
