The profit dealt with in the accounts of the parent company was 0.2m 2007 52.3m.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 1 revised and not prepared a cash flow statement.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 29 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation to not disclose certain information on the Companys financial instruments as this information is incorporated within the Group accounts that include the relevant disclosures.
FINANCIAL ASSETS All investments excluding investments in subsidiary undertakings are classified as fair value through profit and loss and are measured at fair value.
Fair value is determined using published bid price quotations of each security.
Unquoted equity investments are initially carried at cost as the best estimate of fair value and are adjusted thereafter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not approximate to fair value.
The fair value of an unquoted equity is calculated using the most appropriate valuation technique, such as reference to current fair values of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or option pricing models.
Management considers the fair value through profit and loss option to be appropriate as financial assets are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information is provided internally on that basis to key management personnel.
In addition, investment risk is assessed on a total return basis, which is consistent with the adoption of fair value through profit and loss.
All purchases and sales of investments are accounted for at trade date.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value and derecognised when they have been sold.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from the change in fair value are included in the profit and loss account in the period in which they arise.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Companys activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
OTHER INCOME Other income comprises rental income and management rebate fees receivable from investment managers.
Income is booked when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
INVESTMENT INCOME Investment income comprises all investment income, realised investment gains and losses and movements in unrealised gains and losses, net of investment management fees.
The Company recognises dividend income on establishment of the shareholders right to receive the payment.
Investment income comprises interest receivable, which is valued using the effective interest method.
EXPENSES Expenses, including administrative expenses and interest charges, are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the profit and loss account as incurred except as follows: Expenses that are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of investments Expenses that are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the disposal proceeds of the investment TAXATION The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable income for the year.
Taxable profits differs from net profit as reported in the profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on un-remitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
