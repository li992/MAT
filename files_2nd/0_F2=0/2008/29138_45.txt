During the year no Director was interested in any contract or other matter requiring disclosure under section 232 of the Companies Act 1985.
20 Contingencies, Guarantees and Financial Commitments At the year end the Company had a contingent liability amounting to 10 million 2007 10 million under a subscription agreement relating to participating loan notes.
The obligation will expire on 31 December 2010.
21 Contingent Asset In June 2007 the European Court of Justice ruled that investment trust management fees should be exempt from VAT and this decision has now been accepted by HM Revenue and Customs.
The result of this decision is that future management fees will not be subject to VAT and the Company will be able to recover some of the VAT incurred on past management fees.
A number of procedural matters remain to be resolved however before certainty is reached in respect of the amount of VAT that will be repaid.
Consequently, no amounts have been recognised as an asset within these Accounts.
The amount recoverable however will not be material and, for the period from 2000 to 2007, is expected to be about 0.2% of shareholders funds.
22 Summary of Main Investment Restrictions as incorporated within the Investment Management Agreement between the Company and Baillie Gifford & Co Holding size At the time of investment, a maximum of 8% of total assets may be invested in any one holding.
This restriction does not apply to investment in collective investment schemes, issues by way of rights or certain government bonds.
A maximum of 40% of total assets may be invested in holdings exceeding 3% of the value of the Companys total assets.
Again, this restriction does not apply to collective investment schemes, issues by way of rights or certain government bonds.
Categories of investment No investment shall be made on which there is unlimited liability.
The Managers must seek permission of the Board to invest in collective investment schemes managed by Baillie Gifford & Co.
Transactions in futures and options must be consistent with HM Revenue and Customs guidelines so as to ensure maintenance of the Companys Investment Trust status.
23 Financial Instruments As an Investment Trust, the Company invests in equities and makes other investments so as to achieve its investment objective of maximising total return, whilst also generating real dividend growth, from a focused and actively managed global portfolio.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with the financial instruments and markets in which it invests.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent loss of capital rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
Risk provides the potential for both loss and gains and in assessing risk, the Board encourages the Managers to exploit the opportunities that risk affords.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
SCOTTISH MORTGAGE INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 43 NOTES TO ACCOUNTS 23 Financial Instruments continued Market Risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Managers both assess the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitor the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The Investment Managers monitor the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and report to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Managers assess the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the country in which a company is listed is not necessarily where it earns its profits.
The movement in exchange rates on overseas earnings may have a more significant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the company is quoted.
Foreign currency borrowings can limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation, which is calculated by reference to the currency in which the asset or liability is quoted, is shown below.
44 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 NOTES TO ACCOUNTS 23 Financial Instruments continued Currency Risk Sensitivity At 31 March 2008, if sterling had strengthened by 5% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by the amounts shown overleaf.
A 5% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2007.

Interest rate movements may also impact upon the market value of the Companys investments outwith fixed income securities.
The effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a significant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and fixed income securities and the income receivable on cash deposits, floating rate notes and other similar investments.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
Movements in interest rates, to the extent that they affect the market value of the Companys fixed rate borrowings, may also affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value.
The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 31 March is shown below: Financial Assets 2008 2007 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted Fair value average average period Fair value average average period 000 interest rate until maturity 000 interest rate until maturity Fixed rate: Sterling bonds 2,577 8.4% 5 years 3,134 7.4% 40 years Euro bonds 2,735 13.8% 11 years 9,674 8.9% 12 years US bonds 2,473 14.0% 9 years US bonds perpetual 1,864 17.0% N A 2,118 5.5% N A Floating rate: Sterling bonds interest rate linked to sterling LIBOR 14,651 9.7% 31 years 5,370 8.1% 21 years Euro bonds interest rate linked to euro LIBOR 2,144 10.2% 77 years 6,104 8.1% 36 years Brazilian bonds index linked 64,579 11.4% 37 years 48,305 11.5% 38 years Based on expected maturity date.
The cash deposits generally comprise call or short term money market deposits of less than one month which are repayable on demand.
The benchmark rate which determines the interest payments received on cash balances is the bank base rate.
SCOTTISH MORTGAGE INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 45 NOTES TO ACCOUNTS 23 Financial Instruments continued Interest Rate Risk continued Financial Liabilities 2008 2007 000 000 The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March was: Floating rate Swiss franc denominated 18,059 14,825 Yen denominated 41,602 59,330 US$ denominated 50,315 Fixed rate Sterling denominated 151,838 151,953 US$ denominated 15,094 Yen denominated 42,967 Swiss franc denominated 61,553 49,542 Euro denominated 58,199 439,627 275,650 The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March was: In one year or less, or on demand 109,976 74,155 In two to five years 177,813 49,542 In more than five years weighted average period fixed 16 years 151,163 151,278 No fixed date for repayment 675 675 439,627 275,650 Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 31 March 2008 would have decreased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 7,201,000 2007 5,322,000.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 31 March 2008 would have increased the net asset value per share with borrowings at fair value by 3.70p 2007 4.80p.
Other Price Risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objectives and investment policies.
The portfolio does not seek to reproduce the index, investments are selected based upon the merit of individual companies and therefore performance may well diverge from the short term fluctuations of the benchmark.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity Fixed asset investments are valued at bid prices which equate to their fair value.
A full list of the Companys investments is given on pages 14 to 16.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the investment portfolio by broad industrial or commercial sector and a list of the 30 largest equity investments by their aggregate market value are contained in the Managers Review Section.
118.2% of the Companys net assets are invested in equities.
A 3% increase in quoted equity valuations at 31 March 2008 would have increased total assets and total return on ordinary activities by 65,128,000 2007 58,642,000.
A decrease of 3% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Board provides guidance to the Investment Managers as to the maximum exposure to any one holding and to the maximum aggregate exposure to substantial holdings.
The Company has the power to take out borrowings, which give it access to additional funding when required.
46 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 NOTES TO ACCOUNTS 23 Financial Instruments continued Credit Risk This is the risk that a failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
This risk is managed as follows: Where the Investment Managers make an investment in a bond or other security with credit risk, that credit risk is assessed and then compared to the prospective investment return of the security in question.
The Board regularly receives information from the Investment Managers on the credit ratings of those bonds and other securities in which the Company has invested.
The Companys listed investments are held on its behalf by The Bank of New York Mellon acting as agent, the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Investment Managers monitor the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports and reporting its findings to the Board.
Investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Investment Managers.
Transactions are ordinarily undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transaction entered into by the Company has delivered on its obligations before any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed.
Transactions involving derivatives, and other arrangements wherein the creditworthiness of the entity acting as broker or counterparty to the transaction is likely to be of sustained interest, are subject to rigorous assessment by the Investment Managers of the creditworthiness of that counterparty.
The Companys aggregate exposure to each such counterparty is monitored regularly by the Board.
Cash is only held at banks that have been identified by the Managers as reputable and of high credit quality.
Credit Risk Exposure The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March was: 2008 2007 000 000 Fixed interest investments 88,550 77,178 Cash and short term deposits 13,030 19,165 Debtors and prepayments 20,026 25,037 121,606 121,380 None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The Directors are of the opinion that the financial assets and liabilities of the Company are stated at fair value in the balance sheet with the exception of long term borrowing.
Long term borrowings are included in the accounts in accordance with FRS26.
Deducting long term borrowings at fair value would have the effect of reducing the net asset value per share from 672.5p to 651.4p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2008 of 600.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 7.9% as against 10.8% on a traditional basis.
At 31 March 2007 the effect would have been to reduce the net asset value from 631.0p to 607.1p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2007 of 542.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 10.7% as against 14.1% on a traditional basis.
