The Group used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model, for valuing the options granted during the year, are as follows: 2008 2007 Weighted average share price 58.0p 105.5p Weighted average exercise price 49.0p 79.0p Volatility 42.96% 33.48% Weighted average expected life 4.0 years 4.0 years Risk free rate 4.68% 4.84% Dividend yield 9.14% 4.17% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous 3 years on a weighted average basis.
The expected life used in the model is the Groups current best estimate of the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, future market conditions and behavioural considerations.
During the year the Group recognised total expenses of 0.1m 2007 0.1m relating to options granted.
All existing options issued after 7 November 2002 and not vested at 1 January 2005, have been valued as required by IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
The share option schemes, other than the Save As You Earn scheme, were discontinued in 2006 and were replaced by a new share based incentive scheme, which is described in the Directors Remuneration Report.
