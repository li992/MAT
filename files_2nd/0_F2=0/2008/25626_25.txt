Comparative reclassification IFRS 8, 'Operating segments', effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2009 has been adopted early in the year beginning 1st January 2008.
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14, 'Segment reporting', and requires a 'management approach' under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
This has resulted in an increase in the number of reportable segments presented, as the previously reported Risk & Insurance segment has been split into London Market and Retail segments.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal management reporting.
Comparatives for 2007 have been restated to reflect the revised segmental reporting.
Alternative income statement The format of the consolidated income statement on page 46 conforms to the requirements of IFRS.
The alternative income statement set out below, which is provided by way of additional information, has been prepared on a basis that conforms more closely to the approach adopted by the Group in assessing its performance.
