b Derivatives: foreign currency forward purchase contracts The most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the US dollar.
The Groups policy is to reduce substantially the risk associated with purchases denominated in foreign currencies by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows.
The foreign exchange contracts do not meet the criteria for treatment as an effective hedge and accordingly any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying values of forward foreign currency purchase contracts were as follows: 27 April 2008 29 April 2007 000 000 Fair value of derivative financial instruments liabilities 47,638 42,463 spoRTs DiRecT iNTeRNATioNAl plc ANNuAl RepoRT 2008 81 The sterling principal amounts of forward foreign currency purchase contracts and contracted forward rates were as follows: 27 April 2008 29 April 2007 000 000 US dollar purchases 1,081,668 1,280,330 Contracted rates 1.86-2.00 1.86-1.99 US dollar sales 397,000 242,004 Contracted rates 1.92-1.98 1.92-1.94 Euro sales 259,716 - Contracted rates 1.25-1.40 - Forward foreign currency purchase and sale contracts generally have a maturity at inception of approximately 12 months.

c sensitivity analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 5% increase and decrease in the US dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The figures have been calculated by comparing the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at the current exchange rate to those if exchange rates moved as illustrated.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity: income statement equity 27 April 29 April 27 April 29 April 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 Sterling strengthens by 5% US dollar 32,603 49,444 32,603 49,444 Euro 12,367 - 12,367 - Sterling strengthens by 5% US dollar 34,233 51,916 34,233 51,916 Euro 12,986 - 12,986 - Interest rate sensitivity analysis The following table illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
