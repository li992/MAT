Financial risk management The Group financial risk management strategy The financial risks arising from the Groups operations are market risk, including risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks arise in the normal course of business, and the Group manages its exposure to them in accordance with the Groups Portfolio Risk Management Strategy.
The objective of the strategy is to support the delivery of the Groups financial targets while protecting its future financial security and flexibility by taking advantage of the natural diversification provided by the scale, diversity and flexibility of the Groups operations and activities.
A Cash Flow at Risk CFaR framework is used to measure and control the aggregate and diversified impact of financial risks upon the Groups financial targets.
The principal measurement of risk is the portfolio CFaR which is defined as the worst expected loss relative to projected business plan cash flows over a one-year horizon under normal market conditions at a confidence level of 95 per cent.
Controls over this risk include Board-approved limits on the quantum of the CFaR relative to the Groups financial targets.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it to risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices.
Under the strategy outlined above, the Group seeks to achieve financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices on a floating or index basis.
This strategy gives rise to a risk of variability in earnings which is managed under the CFaR.
In executing the strategy, financial instruments are potentially employed in four distinct but related activities.
The following table summarises these activities and the key risk management processes.
Activity Key risk management processes 1.
Risk mitigation Assessment of portfolio CFaR against Hedging of revenues with financial instruments will be executed to mitigate risk at the Board-approved limits portfolio level when CFaR exceeds the Board-approved limits.
Similarly, and on an exception Execution of transactions within approved basis, hedging for the purposes of mitigating risk related to specific and significant mandates expenditure on investments or capital projects will be executed if necessary to support the Groups strategic objectives.
Economic hedging of commodity sales, operating costs and debt instruments Assessment of portfolio CFaR against Where group commodity production is sold to customers on pricing terms that deviate from Board-approved limits the relevant index target, and where a relevant derivatives market exists, financial instruments Measuring and reporting the exposure in are executed as an economic hedge to align the revenue price exposure with the index target.
customer commodity contracts and issued Where debt is issued with a currency or interest rate profile that deviates from the relevant debt instruments index target, fair value hedges are executed to align the debt exposure with the index target.
Executing hedging derivatives to align the Similarly, where specific and significant operating costs are contracted in a currency that total group exposure to the index target deviates from the relevant index target, financial instruments are executed as an economic hedge to align the currency exposure with the index target.
Strategic financial transactions Exposures managed within Value at Risk Opportunistic transactions may be executed with financial instruments to capture value and stop loss limits from perceived market over under valuations.
Execution of transactions within approved mandates 4.
Proprietary trading Measuring and reporting the exposure Certain of our business units are mandated to undertake trading activities in specifically in mandated activities approved commodity derivatives.
These activities are in support of our underlying commodity Exposures managed within approved mandates businesses and provide market and commercial insight.
including position limits, value at risk limits and stop loss limits Primary responsibility for identification and control of financial risks, including authorising and monitoring the use of financial instruments for the above activities and stipulating policy thereon, rests with the Financial Risk Management Committee under authority delegated by the Group Management Committee.

Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair value of fixed rate financial instruments.
Interest rate risk is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
The majority of debt is raised under central borrowing programs.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to convert most of the centrally raised debt into US dollar floating rate exposures.
As at 30 June 2008, the Group holds US$1.6 billion 2007: US$1.6 billion of fixed interest borrowings that have not been swapped to floating rates, arising principally from debt raised prior to the DLC merger.
The Groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating rate component of the Groups net borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps in fair value hedge relationships used to hedge both interest rate and foreign currency risks are as follows: Fair value 2008 2007 US$M US$M Interest rate swaps US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Later than two years but not later than five years 59 21 Later than five years 69 135 Cross currency swaps Australian dollar to US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Not later than one year 344 Later than one year but not later than two years 249 Euro to US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Not later than one year 162 290 Later than one year but not later than two years 17 Later than two years but not later than five years 190 41 Later than five years 125 14 Total fair value of interest rate swaps 949 427 Based on the net debt position as at 30 June 2008, taking into account interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, it is estimated that a one percentage point increase in the US LIBOR interest rate will decrease the Groups profit before taxation by US$59 million 2007: US$80 million.
This assumes that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and the fixed floating mix and balances is constant over the year.
However, interest rates and the debt profile of the Group are unlikely to remain constant in the coming financial year and therefore such sensitivity analysis should be used with care.
208 - BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2008 5 5463 BHPB AR Book.
Financial risk management continued Currency risk The US dollar is the functional currency of most operations within the Group and as a result currency exposures arise from transactions and balances in currencies other than the US dollar.
The Groups potential currency exposures comprise: translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues The potential currency exposures are discussed below.
Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items Monetary items, including financial assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are periodically restated to US dollar equivalents, and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement.
The exception is foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency provisions for closure and rehabilitation at operating sites which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment.
The foreign currency risk relating to monetary items is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy within the overall CFaR limit.
The following table shows the foreign currency risk on the financial assets and liabilities of the Groups operations denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the operations.
Net financial assets liabilities US$ A$ SA rand GBP Other Total 2008 US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M Functional currency of Group operation US dollars 1,114 186 39 1,318 351 Australian dollars UK pounds sterling 12 12 12 1,114 186 39 1,318 363 Net financial assets liabilities US$ A$ SA rand GBP Other Total 2007 US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M US$M Functional currency of Group operation US dollars 1,107 391 756 290 330 Australian dollars 2 1 1 UK pounds sterling 2 2 1,107 391 756 289 329 The principal non-functional currencies to which the Group is exposed are the Australian dollar, South African rand and UK pound sterling.
Based on the Groups net financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2008, a weakening of the US dollar against these currencies as illustrated in the table below, with all other variables held constant, would have affected post-tax profit and equity as follows: 2008 2007 US$M US$M Currency movement Post-tax profit Equity Post-tax profit Equity 1 cent movement in Australian dollar 11 11 10 9 0.2 rand movement in South African rand 25 511 1 pence movement in UK pound sterling 1 1 15 15 The Groups financial asset and liability profile will not remain constant however, and therefore these sensitivities should be used with care.
Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues Certain operating and capital expenditure is incurred by some operations in currencies other than their functional currency.
To a lesser extent, certain sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations, and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
These currency risks are managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
When required under this strategy the Group enters into forward exchange contracts.
In September 2007 the Group chose to discontinue the capital hedging policy for projects over US$100 million and as a result all existing hedges were closed out in the market by taking opposite positions.
Gains and losses held in the cash flow hedge reserve at the time of discontinuing this hedge policy are recognised as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment acquired over the period of the original hedge.
All such gains and losses will be recognised by 31 December 2008.
The fair value of these hedges at 30 June 2008 is US$2 million 2007: US$156 million.
There are no significant forward exchange contracts outstanding to manage short-term foreign currency cash flows relating to operating activities.
BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2008 - 209 5 5463 BHPB AR Book.
Financial risk management continued Commodity price risk Contracts for the sale and physical delivery of commodities are executed whenever possible on a pricing basis intended to achieve a relevant index target.
Where pricing terms deviate from the index, derivative commodity contracts are used when available to return realised prices to the index.
Contracts for the physical delivery of commodities are not typically financial instruments and are carried in the balance sheet at cost typically at nil : they are therefore excluded from the fair value and sensitivity tables below.
Accordingly, the financial instrument exposures set out in the tables below do not represent all of the commodity price risks managed according to the Groups objectives.
Movements in the fair value of contracts included in the tables below are offset by movements in the fair value of the physical contracts, however only the former movement is recognised in the Groups income statement prior to settlement.
The risk associated with commodity prices is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
Financial instruments with commodity price risk included in the following tables are those entered into for the following activities: economic hedging of prices realised on commodity contracts as described above proprietary trading purchases and sales of physical contracts that can be cash-settled cash flow hedging of revenues derivatives embedded within other supply contracts.
All such instruments are carried in the balance sheet at fair value.

Financial risk management continued The Groups exposure at 30 June 2008 to the impact of movements in commodity markets upon the financial instruments, other than those designated as a cash flow hedge or embedded derivatives, is set out in the following table.
2008 2007 Impact on Impact on equity and equity and profit of 10% profit of 10% movement in movement in Net exposure market price Net exposure market price Receive post-tax Receive post-tax Units of exposure Deliver US$M Deliver US$M Aluminium 000 tonnes 55 17 26 7 Copper 000 tonnes 73 55 11 4 Zinc 000 tonnes 20 2 82 Lead 000 tonnes 5 12 3 Silver Million ounces 13 33 Nickel 000 tonnes 4 9 Iron ore 000 tonnes 1,095 18 Energy coal 000 tonnes 185 11 360 Petroleum 000 barrels 934 10 106 7 Electricity 000 mwh 22 28 Gas 000 therms 15,500 1 2,117 Freight Time charter days 7,735 68 7,228 32 000 voyage charter tonnes 600 7 290 31 The sensitivities in the above table have been determined as the absolute impact on fair value of a 10 per cent increase in the commodity prices that were applied to the fair value measurement at each reporting date.
The relationship between commodity prices and foreign currencies is complex and movements in foreign exchange can impact commodity prices.
The sensitivities should therefore be used with care.
In addition, the Group is exposed to commodity prices on derivatives embedded in host contracts.
A 10 per cent increase in the commodity price related to those contracts would decrease the Groups equity and profit after tax by US$15 million 2007: US$7 million.
This relates primarily to a contract to purchase gas under a take or pay contract where the price is index-linked to inflation and the scrap metal price.
As at 30 June 2008, the Group was contracted to purchase 171 million gigajoules of gas 2007: 202 million gigajoules over the remaining term of the contract expiring in December 2013.
Liquidity risk The Groups liquidity risk arises from the possibility that it may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due and is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
Operational, capital and regulatory requirements are considered in the management of liquidity risk, in conjunction with short and long-term forecast information.
Additional liquidity risk arises on debt related derivatives due to the possibility that a market for derivatives might not exist in some circumstances.
To counter this risk the Group only uses derivatives in highly liquid markets.
Moodys Investors Service made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A1 the short-term credit rating is P-1.
Standard & Poors made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A the short-term credit rating is A-1, however the ratings were placed on negative outlook following an announcement of proposed offers for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.
The Groups strong credit profile, diversified funding sources and committed credit facilities ensure that sufficient liquid funds are maintained to meet its daily cash requirements.
The Groups policy on counterparty credit exposures ensures that only counterparties of a high credit standing are used for the investment of any excess cash.
The Groups US$3.0 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility matures in October 2011.
This facility was established in October 2006 and replaced a previous US$3.0 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility with an original maturity date of September 2009.
The multi-currency revolving credit facility is used for general corporate purposes and as backup for the commercial paper programs.
As at 30 June 2008 US$ nil 30 June 2007: US$ nil was drawn under this facility.
The remaining outstanding amount on the Groups US$5.5 billion acquisition facility, established in March 2005 in order to assist with financing of the WMC acquisition and which could only be used for the acquisition, was repaid in July 2006.
There were no defaults on loans payable during the period.
Refer to note 30 for details of the Groups unused credit facilities.

The Group also holds derivatives related to net debt, commodities and currencies that are expected to generate cash inflows, which are classified as other financial assets refer to note 12.
These contracts are excluded from the table above.
212 - BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2008 5 5463 BHPB AR Book.
Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk arises from the non-performance by counterparties of their contractual financial obligations towards the Group.
To manage credit risk the Group maintains Group-wide procedures covering the application for credit approvals, granting and renewal of counterparty limits and daily monitoring of exposures against these limits.
As part of these processes the financial viability of all counterparties is regularly monitored and assessed.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the total carrying value of financial assets on the balance sheet as at the reporting date.
The Groups credit risk exposures are categorised under the following headings: Counterparties The Group conducts transactions with the following major types of counterparties: Receivables counterparties The majority of sales to the Groups customers are made on open terms.
Payment guarantee counterparties A proportion of sales to Group customers occur via secured payment mechanisms.
Derivative counterparties Counterparties to derivative contracts consist of a diverse number of financial institutions and industrial counterparties in the relevant markets.
Cash investment counterparties As part of managing cash flow and liquidity, the Group holds short-term cash investments with a range of financial institutions.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty or group of counterparties.
Geographic The Group trades in all major geographic regions.
Countries in which the Group has a significant credit risk exposure include South Africa, Australia, the US, Japan and China.
Where appropriate, secured payment mechanisms and other risk mitigation instruments are used to protect revenues from credit risk losses.
Industry In line with our asset portfolio, the Group sells into a diverse range of industries and customer sectors.
This diversity means that the Group is not materially exposed to any individual industry or customer.
The following table shows the Groups receivables at the reporting date that are exposed to credit risk and the ageing and impairment profile thereon.

These terms and conditions are determined on a case by case basis with reference to the customers credit quality and prevailing market conditions.
Receivables that are classified as past due in the above tables are those that have not been settled within the terms and conditions that have been agreed with that customer.
The credit quality of the Groups customers is monitored on an ongoing basis and assessed for impairment where indicators of such impairment exist.
The solvency of the debtor and their ability to repay the receivable is considered in assessing receivables for impairment.
The Group considers receivables that are neither past due nor impaired to be of high credit quality.
In circumstances where a receivable is no longer considered to be of high credit quality, the Group may seek collateral as security for the receivable.
There were no significant impairments of receivables as at 30 June 2008.

Financial risk management continued Fair values All financial assets and financial liabilities, other than derivatives, are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration paid or received, net of transaction costs as appropriate, and subsequently carried at fair value or amortised cost, as indicated in the tables below.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
This measurement of fair value is based on quoted market prices.
Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Groups views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities are presented by class in the tables below, and generally approximate to the fair values.
In the case of US$1.3 billion 2007: US$1.3 billion of centrally managed fixed rate debt not swapped to floating rate, the fair value at 30 June 2008 is US$1.5 billion 2007: US$1.4 billion.
