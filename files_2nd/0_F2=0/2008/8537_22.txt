92 Notes 1 Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards and have been applied consistently.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Intangible assets Trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and have a fide nite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life.
The estimated useful lives are up to 20 years.
Provisions Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an out ow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors and creditors Trade debtors and creditors are stated at their nominal value.
Trade debtors are reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings Bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to pro t or loss.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing di erences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing di erences are di erences between the Groups taxable pro ts and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods di erent from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable pro ts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing di erences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when xed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Neither is deferred tax recognised when xed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing di erences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
ITE Group plc Annual Report 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 93 Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined.

Employee Share Trust The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust ESOT.
Shares in the Company held by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity.
The costs of administration of the ESOT are written o to pro t or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Share-based payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value excluding the e ect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the e ect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the e ects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on managements best estimate.
