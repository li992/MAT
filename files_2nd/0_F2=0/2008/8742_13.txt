In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Company estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, based on the expected future trading pattern.
The discount rate employed is the Companys estimated weighted average cost of capital before tax and reflects the relevant risks of the assets being tested for impairment.
The discount rate applied to all CGUs for the year is 6.9% 2007: 5.8%.
The resultant impairment losses in 2008 were nil 2007: 876,000 as shown in the table above.

borrow directly at the fixed rates.
All UK-committed loan facilities are at floating rates, based on LIBOR.
The Company has entered into swap agreements which fix 400 million of these borrowings at rates between 5.40% and 6.46%.
In addition, the Company has entered into forward-starting swap agreements which replace the current 150-million swap agreements expiring in 2009.
The effective weighted average interest rate of the swap agreements entered into is 5.74% 2007: 6.48%, fixed for a weighted average period of 5.3 years 2007: 2 years.
At the balance sheet date, 395 million 2007: 380m was drawn down under the revolving-loan facilities, with interest rates set for periods of between one and six months, at which point monies are repaid and, if appropriate, redrawn.
In addition to the UK facilities, in September 1999, the Company issued $140 million of unsecured US senior loan notes due in September 2009, carrying a fixed rate of interest of 8.48%.
The Company entered into currency and swap agreements covering the duration of these notes which remove all US dollar exposure by fixing the exchange rate at a weighted average of 1:$1.605 and converting the interest rate to one based on LIBOR.
The Company has commenced its review of the options available to it in replacing all or part of the US senior loan notes.
From discussions with its syndicated banks, the Company is confident that funding will be available to achieve this and to ensure that there will be sufficient loan facilities to meet its forward financial commitments.
Interest-rate and currency risks of fnancial liabilities An analysis of the interest-rate profile of the financial liabilities, after taking account of all interest-rate swaps and the cross-currency swap on US senior loan notes, is set out in the following table.

52 J D WETHERSPOON PLC Notes to the fnancial statements 20 Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges At 27 July 2008, the Company had fixed-rate swaps designated as hedges of floating-rate borrowings.
The floating-rate borrowings are interest-bearing borrowings at rates based on LIBOR, fixed for periods of up to six months.
The cash flow hedge of the floating-rate borrowings were assessed to be highly effective: an unrealised gain of 1,256,000 2007: 5,833,000, with a deferred tax charge of 350,000 2007: 1,777,000 relating to the hedging instrument, is included in equity for the year.
Fair value hedge At 27 July 2008, the Company held a cross-currency interest-rate swap in respect of the $140-million US senior loan notes.
The effect of this transaction is to remove any exposure to currency risk, regarding the settlement of this financial liability in September 2009.
The fair value hedge of the $140-million US senior loan notes was assessed to be highly effective, with an unrealised loss of 13,835,000 2007: 15,017,000, relating to the hedging instrument, included in non-current liabilities.
Other derivatives During the year, the Company entered into  which locked the favourable arbitrage between the one-month LIBOR rates and the threeto six-month LIBOR rates, at the time of entering the swaps, over the contractual period between August 2008 and September 2009.
Under the scope of IAS 39, the basis swaps have been treated as fair value through profit or loss.
Consequently, any loss or gain in the mark to market valuation at the balance sheet date is included in the income statement within fair value gain loss of financial derivatives.
At the balance sheet date, the basis swap had a mark to market loss of 794,000.
It is the Companys intention to hold the basis-swap derivative to maturity, and consequently, the Companys cumulative net fair value gain or loss at the end of the contract will be nil.
21 Provisions and other liabilities Included in provisions and other liabilities are lease incentives on leases where the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset.
The lease incentives are recognised as a reduction in rent paid over the lease term, resulting in deferred income recognised on the balance sheet.
