INCOME TAX EXPENSE CONTINUED The total tax charge for the year differs from that resulting from applying the blended rate of corporate tax in the UK 28.5% 2007: 30%.
The differences are explained in the following reconciliation: 2008 2008 2007 2007 m % m % Profit on ordinary activities before tax 33.1 124.3 Tax at 28.5% 2007: 30% thereon 9.4 28.5% 37.3 30.0% Factors affecting the income tax expense for the year: permanent items 1.8 5.3% 2.4 1.9% impairment charges 4.0 12.1% losses not recognised 11.9 36.0% adjustments in respect of previous years 1.3 3.9% 2.3 1.9% effect of overseas tax rates 0.5 1.5% change in tax rates 0.2 0.1% Total income tax expense 26.3 79.5% 37.2 29.9% The effective tax charge for the Group on total profits before tax of 33.1m is 79.5% 2007: 29.9%.
The effective tax charge for the Group on profit before tax before the amortisation of intangibles, impairment charges, gains and losses on derivative financial instruments and restructuring costs of 137.3m is 29.3% 2007: 29.9%, which comprises a charge of 30.3% 2007: 31.8% in respect of current year profits and a tax credit of 1.0% 2007: 1.9% in respect of prior years.
The following factors that will affect the Groups future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits are: the mix of profits between the UK corporate tax rate 28% from April 2008, 30% for the period to April 2008 and overseas: in particular, France Germany Belgium corporate tax rates greater than 28% and Ireland Poland Netherlands Czech Republic Slovakia corporate tax rates substantially less than 28%.
If the proportion of profits from these jurisdictions changes, this could result in a higher or lower Group tax charge: the impact of non-deductible expenditure and non-taxable income: agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities: and the recognition or utilisation with corresponding reduction in cash tax payments of unrecognised deferred tax assets see Note 22.
In addition to the amounts charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, the following amounts in relation to taxes have been credited charged directly to equity and are shown in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and Note 25: 2008 2007 m m Deferred tax movement associated with actuarial loss gain 3.0 2.0 Current and deferred tax on share options 0.7 0.8 Tax credit on exchange difference arising on borrowings and derivative financial instruments 13.8 12.0 16.1 9.2 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 79 noteS to the accountS contInued 7.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group had five share-based payment schemes in existence during the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Group recognised a total charge of 1.0m 2007: 1.6m in the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment transactions issued after 7 November 2002 with a corresponding entry to the share option reserve.
The weighted average fair value of each option granted in the year was 4.18p 2007: 9.59p.
Details of each of the schemes are provided below: A SAVE AS YOU EARN SAYE SCHEME The Company operates a SAYE scheme within the UK which is open to all UK employees and is linked to a monthly savings contract over three and five year periods.
Options have been granted to scheme participants at 80% of the prevailing market price.
The market price is taken approximately one month prior to the official grant date.
Similar arrangements have existed since 17 May 2002 in Ireland.
There are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of these options.
These options may be exercised within a fixed six month period, three or five years from the date of grant.
No SAYE options have been granted in the UK in 2007 or 2008.
Instead, the Company has issued share options in 2007 and 2008 under a Share Investment Plan SIP as approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting see below.
SAYE options were granted in Ireland in 2007 and 2008.

The SAYE options outstanding at the balance sheet date had a weighted average exercise price of 345.0p 2007: 276.1p and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.2 years 2007: 1.5 years.
The weighted average share price on options exercised in the year was 455p 2007: 1,300p.

The expected percentage of total options exercised is based on the Directors best estimate for effects of behavioural conditions.
B EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES ESOS Under the existing ESOS for which the last options were granted in 2003, Directors and Senior Management can be awarded an annual grant of share options at market price, provided that the total amount payable by the individual to exercise options under the ESOS or any other share option scheme of the Group excluding savings related schemes granted during the immediately preceding ten years does not exceed four times base salary, bonus and benefits.
Share options under the ESOS are exercisable between three and ten years for the Inland Revenue approved scheme and three and seven years for the unapproved scheme from the date of grant.
The award would vest in full if, over a consecutive three year period, the growth in the Groups EPS is 6% higher than the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index.
None of the award would vest if the growth in EPS is less than 6% above the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.

C LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP Under the existing LTIP policy, Executives can be awarded an annual grant of nil paid share options up to a maximum value of 100% of base salary.
2003 Ltip critEriA Awards under the 2003 LTIP are exercisable between three and seven years from the date of grant.
Provided the individuals performance criteria are met the award vests if, over a consecutive three year period, the growth in the Groups EPS is 10% higher than the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index.
None of the award vests if the growth in EPS is less than 6% above the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.
Between these two limits, the awards vest proportionately.
The right to exercise options terminates upon the employee ceasing to hold office with the Group, subject to certain exceptions and the discretion of the Board.
If the 6% minimum growth performance target is not met, the performance period is extended by one year and the minimum growth in the Groups EPS, over a consecutive four year period, is increased to 8% over the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.
The target for the full award to vest is 13.33%.
2004 2008 Ltip critEriA Awards under the 2004 to 2008 LTIPs are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The award vests if the percentage growth in the Companys EPS, over the three-year period from the commencement of the financial year in which the award is made, exceeds the percentage growth in the Retail Price Index over the same period.
The percentage of the award vests as follows: EPS % growth less RPI % growth over three-year vesting period 2008 2007 20042006 Percentage of award vesting: none of the award vests 5% p. a.
3% p. a. award vests proportionately between 30% and 100% 5%12% p. a.

D DEFERRED ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME DABS Options were granted under the DABS scheme for the first time in 2005.
The DABS operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to use up to 50% of their annual performance related cash bonus after tax and national insurance in respect of the preceding financial year to purchase shares in the Company.

E SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN SIP Shares were granted under the SIP scheme for the first time in 2005.
The SIP is an HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
For each share purchased by the employee, the Company will match one free share up to a maximum of four free shares per month.
No performance criteria is attached to these matching shares other than to avoid forfeiture they must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
In 2008, 69,702 2007: 54,014 matching shares were granted during the year.
Given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts using the following years operating budget approved by the Directors and an appropriate projection of cash flows based upon industry expectations over a period of five years.
In instances where significant investment is expected, a rate in excess of the industry growth is used in the five-year forecast.
After this period, the growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 2% and do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry.
The discount rates applied to all impairment reviews represent pre tax rates and ranged between 11% and 13%.
During the period the Irish business experienced a significant reduction in demand for its products.
The resulting value in use calculation for the Ireland CGU indicated that the carrying value of goodwill was not supportable, therefore the Ireland CGU has been reduced to the recoverable amount through recognition of an impairment loss against goodwill as follows: m At 31 December 2007 41.7 Additions 1.9 Exchange difference 11.3 Impairment loss recognised 14.2 at 31 december 2008 40.7 The recoverable amounts of all other CGUs were fully supported by the value in use calculations in the year and are as follows: 2008 2007 m m UK Insulation 50.6 41.5 UK Exteriors 82.3 71.1 UK Specialist Construction Products 48.5 42.1 UK Interiors 29.1 17.8 Leaderflush Shapland 14.2 13.2 Ireland 40.7 41.7 Poland 11.3 8.3 Larivire 192.8 141.4 German Roofing 22.1 15.2 Central Europe 21.1 10.3 Air Trade Centre 15.4 total 528.1 402.6 Other CGUs 39.0 32.3 total goodwill 567.1 434.9 In addition, the Group has an indefinite life intangible asset Leaderflush Shapland brand of 12.6m.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS The intangible assets presented below relate entirely to acquired intangibles.
These arise as a result of applying IFRS 3 which requires the separate recognition of acquired intangibles from goodwill.
As detailed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies, the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions that took place before 1 January 2004.
During 2007 and 2008, the Group owned purchased intangible assets with an insignificant book value mainly software separable from any associated hardware and these have not been reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the grounds of materiality.

The weighted average amortisation period for each category of intangible asset is disclosed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies on page 69.
In the opinion of the Directors, the only intangible asset which has an indefinite useful life is the brand attributable to the acquisition of Leaderflush Shapland Limited.
The carrying value of the Leaderflush Shapland brand at the balance sheet date is 12.6m.
An indefinite useful life has been determined for the Leaderflush Shapland brand on the basis that it is expected to be maintained indefinitely and is expected to continue to drive value for the Group.
The recoverable value of the brand is based upon value in use calculations.
Further information on value in use calculations is provided within Note 11.
The Directors have used past experience in determining each of the key assumptions in the value in use calculation for the Leaderflush Shapland brand.
The growth rates assumed are in line with industry expectations and, for periods beyond those covered by its management forecasts, do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry.
The discount rate applied is 11%, equivalent to its pre tax weighted average cost of capital.

The fair value adjustments above relate primarily to: the review of the carrying value of all non-current assets to ensure that they accurately reflect their market value: the alignment of valuation and provisioning methodologies to those adopted by the Group: and an assessment of all provisions and payables to ensure they are accurately reflected in accordance with the Groups policies.
Included within goodwill are staff acquired as part of the business and strategic acquisition synergies which are specifically excluded in the identification of intangible assets on acquisition by the relevant accounting standards.

ACQUISITIONS MADE IN THE YEAR CONTINUED 2008 ACQUISITIONS SUMMARY FAIR VALUE TABLE CONTINUED The Directors estimate the pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit of the 2008 acquisitions for the period from 1 January 2008 to the respective acquisition dates amounted to 34.4m and 6.4m respectively.
The 2008 Consolidated Income Statement includes the following amounts in respect of the 2008 acquisitions: revenue 155.6m, cost of sales 106.7m and operating expenses 35.7m giving an operating profit of 13.2m.
Revenue and operating profit for the twelve-month period ended 31 December 2008 for all 2008 acquisitions amounted to 190.0m and 19.6m respectively.
Acquisitions made in 2008 made in 2007 had the following impact on the Groups cash flows in 2008 in 2007 : cash inflow from operating activities 11.9m 2007: 9.2m, borrowing costs paid 4.8m 2007: 6.1m, purchase of property, plant and equipment 3.2m 2007: 4.8m, repayment of loans nil 2007: nil and income tax paid 2.5m 2007: 2.4m.

No interest is charged on receivables.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 34.1m at 31 December 2008 2007: 25.6m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
Included within the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 119.6m 2007: 140.7m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided for, as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of these receivables is 33.9 days overdue 2007: 26.6 days.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The Directors therefore believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are trade receivables with a gross balance of 64.8m 2007: 46.7m and a provision for impairment of 34.1m 2007: 25.6m.
The impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximate to their fair value.
CREDIT RISk MANAGEMENT Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Trade receivable credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a regular basis.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium sized customers, spread across a number of different market sectors and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer.

HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Included within financial assets are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 74.6m 2007: 0.5m and loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents of 541.4m 2007: 503.6m.
Included within financial liabilities are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 131.5m 2007: 72.2m and liabilities including trade payables at amortised cost of 909.2m 2007: 672.3m.
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where the Group can demonstrate a hedge relationship under the rules of IAS 32 and IAS 39, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Where the Group does not meet these rules, movements in the fair value will be recognised as gains or losses on derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Income Statement in the column entitled Other items.
In order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate and exchange rate changes, the Group utilises both currency and interest rate derivative financial instruments.
The fair value of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
A nEt invEStmEnt hEdgES As at 31 December 2008, the Group had entered into two 31 December 2007: five cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which form a net investment hedge of the Groups Euro denominated trade assets 31 December 2007: Euro and Czech Koruna.
At 31 December 2008, these two derivative financial instruments had a fair value liability of 37.8m 31 December 2007: 15.4m.
Of this fair value movement, a charge of 1.5m 31 December 2007: income of 1.4m has been recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement and a liability of 20.9m 31 December 2007: 8.2m has been recognised directly in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS CONTINUED b cASh fLow hEdgES With regard to cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity and is subsequently removed and included in the Consolidated Income Statement within Finance costs in the same period the hedged item affects the Consolidated Income Statement.
The cash flow hedges described below are expected to impact both profit and loss and cash flow annually over the life of the hedging instrument and the related debt as interest falls due and upon maturity of the debt and related hedging instrument.
As at 31 December 2008, the Group had entered into five 31 December 2007: seven cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into fixed Sterling denominated debt.
In addition, as at 31 December 2008, the Group had entered into one 31 December 2007: one cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instrument which swaps fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into variable Sterling denominated debt.
These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
At 31 December 2008, these six derivative financial instruments had a fair value asset of 64.0m 31 December 2007: liability of 28.2m.
All of these derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
At 31 December 2008, the average maturity date of these swaps is 6.4 years 2007: 7.0 years.
As at 31 December 2008, the Group had entered into eleven 2007: nine interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap variable rate debt into fixed rate debt thereby fixing the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
At 31 December 2008, these eleven derivative financial instruments had a fair value liability of 33.0m 31 December 2007: 4.2m.
All of these interest rate derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
At 31 December 2008, the average maturity date of these swaps is 6.2 years 2007: 4.8 years.
As at 31 December 2008, the Group had entered into five 31 December 2007: eight cross-currency derivative financial instruments which swap fixed Sterling denominated debt into fixed Euro and Czech Koruna denominated debt 31 December 2007: Euro, Polish Zloty and Czech Koruna.
The movement in fair value of these derivative financial instruments hedge the post tax cash flows of the Group and thereby fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group and are therefore fully effective.
As these derivative financial instruments were entered into on 31 December 2008 at market rates prevailing at that date, the fair value of these derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2008 was nil.
At 31 December 2008, the average maturity date of these swaps is one year 2007: one year.
As at 31 December 2008, the Group had entered into three 31 December 2007: three derivative financial instruments which hedged the interest rate exposure on the private placement debt drawn down on 1 February 2007.
As at 31 December 2008, the fair value asset of these derivative financial instruments was 6.3m 2007: liability of 1.6m.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Groups profit or loss and other equity of reasonably possible fluctuations in market rates.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the following hypothetical variations in market rates on the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: a 1% 100 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates: and a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all other currencies that the Group is exposed to.
A INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY The Group is exposed to Sterling, Euro, US Dollar, Polish Zloty and Czech Koruna interest rates.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in each respective interest rate.
The 100 basis points has been disclosed in order to show a reasonable illustration of the Groups sensitivity to interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS CONTINUED B FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVITY The Group is exposed to currency rate changes between Sterling and Euros, US Dollars, Polish Zloty, Czech Koruna and Slovak Koruna.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% change in Sterling against the respective foreign currencies, indicating the likely impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Groups financial position.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
Therefore, in order to present a complete analysis of the Groups exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, the exposure on the Groups total assets and liabilities has been disclosed.
The movements noted above are described below, being mainly attributable to: i gains and losses on derivative financial instruments on some of the Groups net investment hedges and retranslation of Euro interest flows: ii mark-to-market valuation changes in the fair value of fully effective cash flow and net investment hedges and retranslation of assets and liabilities under the scope of IFRS 7: iii retranslation of Euro profit streams and gains and losses on derivative financial instruments on some of the Groups net investment hedges: iv retranslation of overseas denominated assets and liabilities outside the scope of IFRS 7 and mark-to-market valuation changes in the fair value of fully effective cash flow and net investment hedges: v retranslation of US Dollar, Polish Zloty and Czech Koruna interest flows: and vi retranslation of Polish Zloty, Czech Koruna and Slovak Koruna profit streams.

The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which properties are likely to remain vacant and the likely income from existing and future sub lease agreements on a contract by contract basis.
The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in Note 29b.
LEASEHOLD DILAPIDATIONS This provision relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties into their original state of repair.
The provision is calculated with reference to the expired portion of individual lease agreements where such a clause exists in the lease contract.
The transfer of economic benefits will be made at the end of the leases as set out in Note 29b.
CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION Contingent consideration relates to the amounts due to vendors of current and prior year acquisitions providing certain future profit targets are met.
The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made within two years.
OTHER AMOUNTS Other amounts relate principally to claim provisions.
The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made between one and three years.

DEFERRED TAX The net deferred tax liability at the end of the year is analysed as follows: 2008 2007 m m Deferred tax assets 18.7 17.4 Deferred tax liabilities 49.5 44.3 net deferred tax liability 30.8 26.9 The net deferred tax liability is made up of the following elements: 2008 2007 m m deferred tax analysis: Capital allowances in excess of depreciation 7.2 7.1 Short term timing differences 28.5 24.1 Losses 1.0 0.9 On retirement benefit obligations 3.9 3.4 net deferred tax liability 30.8 26.9 The movement during the year in the net deferred tax liability was as follows: Beginning of year 26.9 1.4 On acquisition of subsidiaries 11.6 29.0 Credit for the year 5.2 7.7 Exchange difference 0.4 0.1 On retirement benefit obligations 3.0 2.0 Deferred tax on share options 0.9 2.3 end of year 30.8 26.9 Given current trading the Directors consider that recognition of the deferred tax assets above is appropriate.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries with a lower rate of corporation tax than that suffered in the UK, for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognised, was 62.1m 2007: 39.6m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group has not taken account of excess non-trading losses associated with financial instruments in determining the above deferred tax liability at 31 December 2008, or the deferred tax credit for the year thereon.
In this respect, any future utilisation of the unrecognised deferred tax asset of 40.0m associated with these non-trading losses will result in a reduction of cash payments of tax and will also result in a profit and loss benefit in the year of utilisation.

dEfinEd bEnEfit pEnSion SchEmE vALuAtionS In accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 which was issued on 16 December 2004, the Group has elected to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
Four UK defined benefit pension schemes were merged on 1 January 2008, creating one UK defined benefit pension scheme.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the SIG plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the main scheme, was conducted at 31 December 2007 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets were 75.0m and their actuarial value covered 83% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The other four schemes are book reserved schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.

GUARANTEES AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS CONTINUED C PENSION SCHEMES CONTINUED conSoLidAtEd incomE StAtEmEnt chArgES The pension charge for the year relating to the five defined benefit pension schemes was 1.7m 2007: 2.3m.
In accordance with IAS 19 Retirement Benefits, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The actuarial valuations described above have been updated at 31 December 2008 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new members, has an age profile that is rising and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The four overseas book reserved schemes remain open to new members.
conSoLidAtEd bALAncE ShEEt LiAbiLitY The balance sheet position in respect of the five defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows: 2008 2007 m m Pension liability before taxation 19.1 15.7 Related deferred tax asset 3.9 3.4 Pension liability after taxation 15.2 12.3 The actuarial loss of 10.6m 2007: gain of 6.2m for the year, together with the associated deferred tax credit of 3.0m 2007: debit of 2.0m, has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The remaining deferred tax debit of 2.5m 2007: 1.3m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The cumulative actuarial gains and losses, gross of deferred tax from 2004 onwards recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense amounted to a loss of 11.7m 2007: loss of 1.1m.
Of the above pension liability before taxation, 14.2m 2007: 12.1m relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and 4.9m 2007: 3.6m relates to unfunded schemes.

In addition, there is a possible risk that when SIG acquires certain companies that include employee Shareholders, the capital gain made by these Shareholders could be reclassified as an income tax liability.
This could give rise to a social security cost for the Group of up to 10m.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and have therefore not been disclosed.
REMUNERATION OF kEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL The remuneration of the Directors who are the key management personnel of the Group is provided in the audited part of the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 57 to 59.
