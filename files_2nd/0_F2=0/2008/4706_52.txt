The principal acquired brands are as follows: Remaining Carrying Currency of amortisation amount Product investment period million Johnnie Walker Whisky Sterling Indefinite life 625 Smirnoff Vodka US dollar Indefinite life 414 Crown Royal Whisky US dollar Indefinite life 736 Captain Morgan Rum US dollar Indefinite life 604 Windsor Premier Whisky Korean won Indefinite life 416 Capitalised brands are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives and have not been amortised.
These brands are protected in all of the major markets where they are sold by trademarks, which are renewable indefinitely.
There are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful lives of these brands.
The nature of the premium drinks industry is that obsolescence is not a common issue, with indefinite brand lives being commonplace, and Diageo has a number of brands that were originally created more than 100 years ago.
Accordingly the directors believe that it is appropriate that the brands are treated as having indefinite lives for accounting purposes.
Impairment reviews are carried out annually to ensure that brands are not carried at above their recoverable amounts.
In particular, the group performs a discounted cash flow analysis to compare discounted estimated future operating cash flows with the net carrying value of each acquired brand.
The analysis is based on forecast cash flows for the next financial year, with terminal values being calculated using the long term growth rate the real gross domestic product GDP growth rate of the country plus its inflation rate of the principal countries in which the majority of the profits of each brand are generated.
The estimated cash flows are discounted at the groups weighted average cost of capital in the relevant country.
Any impairment write downs identified are charged to the income statement.
The test is dependent on management estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, and the discount rate applied to these cash flows.
Management has concluded that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which it has determined the recoverable amounts of acquired brands would cause their carrying values to exceed their recoverable amounts.
b The group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill is impaired.
The goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and a discounted cash flow analysis is computed to compare discounted estimated future operating cash flows with the net carrying value of each business.
The analysis is based on forecast cash flows for the next financial year, with terminal values being calculated using the long term growth rate the real GDP growth rate of the country plus its inflation rate of the relevant country.
Management has concluded that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which it has determined the recoverable amount of goodwill would cause its carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
c Other intangible assets principally comprise distribution rights.
The distribution rights for Ketel One vodka products were acquired during the year for $1,800 million 911 million.
Diageo has the global rights to distribution in perpetuity and the directors believe that it is appropriate that the rights are treated as having an indefinite life for accounting purposes.
An impairment review is carried out annually to ensure that the rights are not carried at above their recoverable amounts.
All other distribution rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the length of the distribution arrangements, generally between 10 and 20 years.
d Computer software includes 35 million 2007 19 million in respect of projects in the course of development.
