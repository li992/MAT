BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Supplementary information on oil and natural gas Supplementary information on oil and natural gas Movements in estimated net proved reserves For details of BPs governance process for the booking of oil and natural gas reserves, see page 19.
BP estimates proved reserves for reporting purposes in accordance with SEC rules and relevant guidance.
As currently required, these proved reserve estimates are based on prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made.
There was a rapid and substantial decline in oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2008 that was not matched by a similar reduction in operating costs by the end of the year.
BP does not expect that these economic conditions will continue.
However, our 2008 reserves are calculated on the basis of operating activities that would be undertaken were year-end prices and costs to persist.
Proved reserves exclude royalties due to others, whether payable in cash or in kind where the royalty owner has a direct interest in the underlying production and the option and ability to make lifting and sales arrangements independently.
b Excludes NGLs from processing plants in which an interest is held of 19 thousand barrels per day.
c Includes 807 million barrels of NGLs.
Also includes 21 million barrels of crude oil in respect of the 30% minority interest in BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC.
d Includes 36 million barrels of NGLs.
Also includes 216 million barrels of crude oil in respect of the 6.80% minority interest in TNK-BP.
e Proved reserves in the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska include an estimated 54 million barrels upon which a net profits royalty will be payable over the life of the field under the terms of the BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust.
b Includes 193 billion cubic feet of natural gas consumed in operations, 149 billion cubic feet in subsidiaries, 44 billion cubic feet in equity-accounted entities and excludes 16.9 billion cubic feet of produced non-hydrocarbon components which meet regulatory requirements for sales.
c Includes 3,108 billion cubic feet of natural gas in respect of the 30% minority interest in BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC.
d Includes 131 billion cubic feet of natural gas in respect of the 5.92% minority interest in TNK-BP.

187 Financial statements BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Supplementary information on oil and natural gas Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes therein relating to proved oil and gas reserves The following tables set out the standardized measures of discounted future net cash flows, and changes therein, relating to crude oil and natural gas production from the groups estimated proved reserves.
This information is prepared in compliance with the requirements of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
69 Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities.
Future net cash flows have been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions which may or may not be realized.
These include the timing of future production, the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the application of year-end crude oil and natural gas prices and exchange rates.
Furthermore, both reserves estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change.
BP cautions against relying on the information presented because of the highly arbitrary nature of assumptions on which it is based and its lack of comparability with the historical cost information presented in the financial statements.
b Production costs, which include production taxes and development costs relating to future production of proved reserves, are based on year-end cost levels and assume continuation of existing economic conditions.
Future decommissioning costs are included.
c Taxation is computed using appropriate year-end statutory corporate income tax rates.
d Future net cash flows from oil and natural gas production are discounted at 10% regardless of the group assessment of the risk associated with its producing activities.
e Minority interest in BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC amounted to $900 million at 31 December 2008 $2,300 million at 31 December 2007 and $1,300 million at 31 December 2006. f Total change in the standardized measure during the year includes the effect of exchange rate movements.
188 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Supplementary information on oil and natural gas Equity-accounted entities In addition, at 31 December 2008, the groups share of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of equity-accounted entities amounted to $9,000 million $28,300 million at 31 December 2007 and $14,700 million at 31 December 2006, excluding minority interest.
Operational and statistical information The following tables present operational and statistical information related to production, drilling, productive wells and acreage.

b Crude oil includes natural gas liquids and condensate.
c Natural gas production excludes gas consumed in operations.
Productive oil and gas wells and acreage The following tables show the number of gross and net productive oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage in which the group and its equity-accounted entities had interests as at 31 December 2008.
A gross well or acre is one in which a whole or fractional working interest is owned, while the number of net wells or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional working interests in gross wells or acres.
Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production.
Developed acreage is the acreage within the boundary of a field, on which development wells have been drilled, which could produce the reserves: while undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities, whether or not such acres contain proved reserves.
b Includes approximately 2,631 gross 1,737 net multiple completion wells.
If one of the multiple completions in a well is an oil completion, the well is classified as an oil well.

Net oil and gas wells completed or abandoned The following table shows the number of net productive and dry exploratory and development oil and natural gas wells completed or abandoned in the years indicated by the group and its equity-accounted entities.
Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation.
A dry well is one found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify completion.
Suspended development wells and long-term suspended exploratory wells are also included in the table.
