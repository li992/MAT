Pension arrangements HMV Group employees are members of a number of pension schemes.
The main scheme that covers employees in the United Kingdom is the HMV Group Pension Scheme the Scheme established with effect from July 1998.
The Scheme has two sections the Pension Benefit Section and the Pension Saver Section.
There is also a small defined benefit pension arrangement in Ireland, which is included in the Group amounts disclosed below, but is not included in the Company amounts.
Pension Benefit Section The Pension Benefit Section is of the defined benefit type and is an Inland Revenue exempt approved scheme for the purpose of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
It is contracted out of SERPS.
The benefits it provides are based on final pensionable pay and are guaranteed to increase in payment by 5% per annum or by the increase in the cost of living, if less.
Members currently contribute at the rate of 5% of pensionable pay.
A valuation is undertaken on at least a triennial basis by a qualified actuary.
The most recently completed actuarial valuation was as at 30 June 2004 and was based on an assumed investment return of 6.5% a year, salary increases of 4.25% a year, and annual pension increases of 2.75%, and used the projected unit method.
The result of the valuation was a level of asset cover of 79%, representing a funding deficit of 11.5m, which was funded by three 4.4m special contributions, the last of which was paid on 31 May 2006.
The market value of the assets of the Pension Benefit Scheme at 30 June 2004 was about 43.9m.
In addition, the funding rate was set at 19.9% of pensionable pay including an allowance for administrative expenses.
Therefore from 1 July 2005, the Group has been contributing at a rate of 14.9% of pensionable pay, with the members contributing at 5% of pensionable pay.
The actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2007 is now close to completion.
Following this, the next actuarial review will take place no later than 30 June 2010.
