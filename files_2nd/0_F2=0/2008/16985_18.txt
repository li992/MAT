Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1.
Authorisation of financial statements & statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC for the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2008 were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 10 March 2009.
The comparative information is presented for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007.
For practical reasons, the Group prepares its financial statements to the week ending closest to the Company reference date of 31 December.
The results on this basis are unlikely to be materially different from those that would be presented for a period of one year.
The Weir Group PLC is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of The Companies Act 1985.
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 3.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
These financial statements are presented in sterling.
All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million pounds m except when otherwise indicated.
In order to provide the users of the financial statements with a more relevant presentation of the Groups underlying performance, profit for each financial year has been analysed between i profit before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation: and ii the effect of exceptional items and intangible amortisation.
a Exceptional items are material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the elements of the Groups financial performance for the period and are presented on the face of the income statement to facilitate comparisons with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
b Intangibles amortisation, including impairment, has been shown separately to provide increased visibility over the impact of increased acquisition activity on intangible assets.
Further analysis of the items included in the column, Exceptional items and intangibles amortisation, is provided in note 5 to the financial statements.
In addition to the restatements arising from discontinued operations, as disclosed in note 26, certain amounts in the consolidated cashow statement have been reclassied.
A 2007 net inow amount of 0.7m in relation to gains on derivatives has been reclassied from cash generated from operating activities to cash generated from nancing activities.
Use of estimates & judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Details of the significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are described on page 19.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results, cash ows and assets and liabilities of The Weir Group PLC the Company and its subsidiaries together, the Group, and the Groups share of its joint ventures results.
The financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company using consistent accounting policies.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
The results of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the Groups results from the effective date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The results of a subsidiary sold during the period are included in the Groups results up to the effective date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from the Company shareholders equity.
Joint ventures & associate The Group has a number of long-term contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures.
These all take the form of agreements to share control over other entities jointly controlled entities.
The Groups interests in the results and assets and liabilities of its jointly controlled entities, are accounted for using the equity method.
An associate is an entity over which the Company, either directly or indirectly, is in a position to exercise significant inuence by participating in, but not controlling or jointly controlling, the financial and operating policies of the entity.
An associate is accounted for using the equity method.
50 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2008 2.
Accounting policies continued These investments are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets less any impairment in value.
The income statement reects the share of results of operations of these investments after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the investees equity, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this when applicable in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture or associate, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Groups share of the net fair value of the joint venture or associates identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is included in the carrying amount of the joint venture or associate and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the joint venture or associates identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Groups share of the joint venture or associates profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Foreign currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entitys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the income statement except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences to be nil as at 27 December 2003.
Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before 27 December 2003.
In the cash ow statement, the cash ows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is shown net of sales taxes, discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from sales of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods and can be reliably measured.
Revenue from the sales of services and revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion where the outcome can be estimated reliably, otherwise it is recognised to the extent costs are incurred.
The stage of completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of the contract work.
The basis used is dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract and takes into account the degree to which the physical proportion of the work is subject to formal customer acceptance procedures.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period when such losses become probable.
Property, plant & equipment The Group elected to use previous UK GAAP revaluations of land and buildings, amounting to 10.5m, prior to 27 December 2003 as deemed cost at the date of the revaluation.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, which is in the following ranges Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings - 10 - 40 years Short leasehold land & buildings - duration of lease Plant & equipment - 3 - 20 years Borrowing costs attributable to assets under construction are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Investment property The Group has one property which is currently being held to earn rentals and for capital appreciation rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services and as such this property is classied as investment property.
Investment property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over 40 years.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2008 51 Notes to the Group Financial Statements Continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Goodwill Business combinations on or after 27 December 2003 are accounted for under IFRS3 using the purchase method.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the entitys identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill in respect of an acquired subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entitys assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately as a gain in the income statement.
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 27 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount at that date and is not amortised.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit.
Goodwill that was written off directly to reserves under UK GAAP is not taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of acquired businesses on or after 27 December 2003.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benets and its fair value can be measured reliably.
An intangible asset with a nite life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost which, in respect of an acquired intangible asset, represents its fair value at the acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life.
An intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset.
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost of the software to the income statement over its expected useful life, not exceeding eight years.
The expected useful lives of the acquired intangible assets are as follows Brand names - indefinite life Customer relationships - 7 - 25 years Purchased software - 4 - 8 years Intellectual property & trade marks - 6 -15 years Other - up to 6 years Research & development costs All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it relates to the development of a new product and it is incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product has been proven, the development costs can be measured reliably, future economic benets are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset.
Any such capitalised development expenditure will be amortised on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product.
Impairment of non-current assets All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired.
Additionally, goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite life and any capitalised development expenditure are subject to an annual impairment test.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An assets value in use represents the present value of the future cash ows expected to be derived from the asset.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
Similarly, the recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash ows of the cash-generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost represents the expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads.
Raw material cost is generally determined on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.
52 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2008 2.
Accounting policies continued Financial assets & liabilities The Group's principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The Group also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Trade & other receivables Trade receivables, which generally are of a short dated nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash & cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less, bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.
Interest-bearing loans & borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the obligation can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specic to the liability.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
Additionally, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by reference to current market rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
The fair value of cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS39 are met.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS39 and practical to do so.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships will be classied as fair value hedges, cash ow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classied as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
Where the hedging relationship is classied as a cash ow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a nonfinancial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2008 53 Notes to the Group Financial Statements Continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups share option schemes and the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards.
For equity settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modied.
The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or performance conditions.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group has applied IFRS2 Share-based Payment retrospectively only to equity settled awards that were granted on or after 7 November 2002 and had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classied in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Post-employment benets Post-employment benets comprise pension benets provided to employees throughout the world and other benets, primarily post-retirement healthcare, provided to certain employees in the United States.
For dened benefit plans, the cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benets are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, or immediately if the benets have vested.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
The dened benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on appropriate high quality corporate bonds, at the balance sheet date, minus any past service costs not yet recognised, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
For dened contribution plans, the cost represents the Groups contributions to the plans and this is charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
Leases Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classied as finance leases.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases.
Subsequently, the assets are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or the lease term if shorter.
At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability.
Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a charge to the income statement while the capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding liability.
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Taxation Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions.
a Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised.
54 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2008 2.
Accounting policies continued b Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
c A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
New standards & interpretations The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.

# Not yet mandatory for use in the European Union until 1 January 2009.
The above standards and interpretations will be adopted in accordance with their effective dates and have not been adopted in these financial statements.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
IAS23 revised requires borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition or construction of certain assets to be capitalised.
The option currently taken by the Group of charging such costs to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred will no longer be available prospectively from 1 January 2009.
IFRS3 revised will apply to business combinations arising from 1 January 2010.
This will require recognition of subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in the income statement rather than against goodwill.
In addition, transaction costs will be required to be recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2008 55 Notes to the Group Financial Statements Continued 3.
Segment information With effect from 1 May 2008, the Group changed its organisation and reporting structure to reect its increasing focus on the mining, oil and gas, and power and industrial markets.
For management purposes, the Group has been reorganised into three divisions: Oil & Gas, Minerals and Power & Industrial.
These divisions replace the Groups former divisions of Engineering Products, Engineering Services and Defence, Nuclear & Gas and are the basis on which the Group reports its segment information.
Group companies principally include the results of Liquid Gas Equipment which supplies equipment to the liqueed petroleum gas marine and onshore markets.
Also included within Group companies are the results of the Canadian distribution business and the Materials and Foundries businesses up to the date of disposal on 29 August, 2 and 3 October 2008 respectively.
None of the businesses disposed of are of sufficient size to meet the denition of a discontinued operation under IFRS5.
The Groups primary reporting format is business segments, as the Groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products and services provided.
The Groups secondary format is geographical segments.
The operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves different markets.
The Oil & Gas Division manufactures pumps and ancillary equipment and provides aftermarket support for the global upstream and downstream oil and gas markets.
The Minerals Division designs and manufactures pumps, hydrocyclones, valves and other complementary equipment with primary sales to the mining, ue gas desulphurisation and oil sands markets.
The Power & Industrial Division designs, manufactures and provides aftermarket support for rotating and ow control equipment to the global power generation and industrial sectors.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The Groups geographical segments are determined by the location of the Groups assets and operations.
Business segments The following tables present revenue and profit information on the Groups continuing operations for the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2008 and the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007.
For comparative purposes, sales to external customers and segment result before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation, including acquisitions, for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007 have been restated to reect the divisional reorganisation noted above.
Unallocated expenses include intangibles amortisation of 0.1m 2007: 0.1m.
Acquisitions for 2008 include Weir SPM, Weir Warman, Weir Mesa and Weir SOS.
Acquisitions for 2007 include Weir SPM.
The results of Weir Multio are not considered significant for 2007 and 2008.
Other current year disposals include the Materials and Foundries businesses and the Canadian distribution business for 2007 and 2008.

Basis of Period of Discount Real Key 1 2 CGU valuation forecast rate growth assumptions Source 3 Weir SPM Value in use 5 years 13.4% 1.2% Revenue growth External forecast 7 2007: 14.8% 2007: nil EBIT margins Historic experience 6 Warman companies Value in use 5 years 14.6% 1.2% Revenue growth External forecast 7 2007: 15.5% 2007: nil EBIT margins Historic experience 5 Weir Gabbioneta Value in use 5 years 14.6% 1.2% Revenue growth External forecast 7 2007: 14.3% 2007: nil EBIT margins Historic experience 4 Weir Warman Value in use 5 years 17.8% 4.0% Revenue growth External forecast 7 2007: n a 2007: n a EBIT margins Historic experience 1 Discount rates The discount rates presented above reect the pre-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital WACC in the most appropriate geographic region.
The WACC is the weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt nancing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance.
On average there has been a moderate decline in the WACC relative to 2007 largely driven by the reduction in benchmark interest rates.
This reduction in benchmark interest rates has been partly offset by an increase in lending margins that banks are now placing on borrowings.
2 Real growth Real growth beyond the 5 year forecast period of 1.2% to 4.0% reects the increasingly global nature of these businesses and the fact that they sell a significant proportion of their products to emerging markets which have long-term stronger growth prospects than their home markets.
3 Weir SPM Weir SPM is a supplier of gas well service pumps, associated ow control equipment and services to the oil and gas production industry.
A large proportion of the businesss revenues are generated in North America with demand being closely related to the number of gas well drilling rigs in operation which is in turn dependent upon natural gas prices and gas storage levels.
Independent forecasts of North American gas well drilling activity, which takes into account forecast natural gas prices and gas storage levels have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter 2008.

Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives continued 4 Weir Warman Weir Warman is a supplier of pumps and associated equipment and services to the African mining industry.
The key drivers for revenues are i levels of mining capital expenditure across Africa which drives demand for original equipment and ii levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service.
Independent forecasts of mining activity have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
5 Weir Gabbioneta Weir Gabbioneta is a supplier of heavy duty process applications to oil and gas renery, petrochemical and power generation industries.
The key drivers for revenues are capital expenditure within oil renery and petro-chemical industries.
Independent forecasts of expenditure in these sectors have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
6 Warman companies The Warman companies supply pumps and associated equipment and services to all global markets outside Africa.
The key drivers for revenues are i levels of mining capital expenditure which drives demand for original equipment and ii levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service.
7 EBIT margins EBIT margins have been forecast based on historic levels taking cognisance of the likely impact of changing economic environments and competitive landscapes on volumes and revenues and the impact of associated management actions on costs.
Sensitivity analysis Base case forecasts show significant headroom above carrying value for each of the CGUs.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonably possible change in key assumptions.
There is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.

Provisions continued Warranties Provision has been made in respect of actual warranty and contract penalty claims on goods sold and services provided and allowance has been made for potential warranty claims based on past experience for goods and services sold with a warranty guarantee.
It is expected that all costs related to such claims will have been incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.
Employee related Employee related provisions arise from legal obligations and asbestosis claims and are based on managements best estimates of the likely costs.
It is expected that the costs will be incurred in the period up to 2021.
Discontinued operations warranty & indemnity Provisions in respect of discontinued operations include provision for warranty and indemnity exposures under asset and share sale agreements.
In addition, provision is included for costs associated with the Groups involvement in the UN sanctioned Oil for Food programme, in respect of which, investigations by UK authorities are ongoing.
Provisions amounting to 0.6m were utilised during 2008 and following the expiry of certain warranty periods, an amount of 1.6m has been released to the income statement as it is no longer required.
Provisions have increased by 5.4m during 2008 in respect of the current year disposals note 8.
The provision as at 26 December 2008 is based on managements current best estimate of the remaining liabilities.
The actual outcome may differ, and in some cases, this may be dependent on the outcome of legal proceedings.
It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within two years of the balance sheet date with the remaining costs expected to be incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.
Rationalisation Rationalisation provisions relate primarily to costs associated with various ongoing restructuring activities across the Group.
It is expected that the provision will be utilised in 2009.
Onerous sales contracts Provision has been made in respect of sales contracts entered into for the sale of goods in the normal course of business where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceeds the economic benets expected to be received from the contracts.
Provision is made immediately when it becomes apparent that expected costs will exceed the expected benets of the contract.
It is expected that the costs will be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.
Other Other provisions relate principally to an environmental clean up programme in the United States, for a company acquired in 1992.
The environmental provision is based on managements current best estimate of the expected costs under the programme.
It is expected that these costs will be incurred in the period up to 2019.

Deferred tax asset balances for unused tax losses of 5.1m 2007: 8.2m and deductible temporary differences of 4.7m 2007: 4.0m have not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence that these assets will be recoverable.
These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb these tax benets.
Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to 10.9m 2007: 16.1m have not been recognised but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
Temporary differences associated with Group investments The Group extracts dividends from its operations in South America and accordingly, a deferred tax liability of 8.6m 2007: 9.1m has been recognised in respect of taxes on the unremitted earnings of the South American subsidiaries.
As at 26 December 2008, this is the only recognised deferred tax liability in respect of taxes on unremitted earnings as the Group does not foresee a distribution of unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries or joint ventures which would result in a reversal of deferred tax.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to 758.4m 2007: 465.8m.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.

Pensions & other post-employment benefit plans The Group has five dened benefit pension plans in the UK and North America, all of which, with the exception of the main UK plan, are final salary pension plans.
Contribution salary in respect of the Groups main UK plan will increase in line with RPI up to a maximum of 5% per annum.
The most significant of the dened benefit plans are the two UK plans and the Canadian plan.
All dened benefit plans are closed to new members.
The wind up of the Canadian plan has commenced and is expected to be completed in 2009.
For these closed plans, the current service cost is expected to increase under the projected unit method as the members of the plan approach retirement.
The Group also provides certain additional post-retirement healthcare benets to senior employees in the United States.

The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2008 87 Notes to the Group Financial Statements Continued 28.
Equity settled share-based payments LTIP Three types of award may be made under the LTIP to senior executives: performance shares, matching shares and investment shares.
All awards vest over a three year period.
Performance shares Performance shares are conditional awards to acquire free shares subject to Group performance.
In 2008, conditional awards of performance shares were made worth 100% 2007: 70% of salary to the chief executive, 100% 2007: 45% of salary to the Group finance director and 100% 2007: 80% to the legal and commercial director.
Other conditional awards of performance shares were made in 2008 worth 100% 2007: 40% of salary to the other members of the Group Operations Executive Committee and 40% 2007: 40% of salary to other senior executives who participate in the matching share awards and 25% 2007: 25% of salary to other senior executives who do not participate in that plan.
The awards were made in two tranches following the 2008 annual general meeting of the Company, where shareholder approval was obtained to amend the terms of the LTIP to increase the annual limit on performance shares from 80% of salary to 100% of salary.
Matching & investment shares Matching shares are conditional awards to acquire free shares, subject to Group performance.
The chief executive, other executive directors and senior executives are required to compulsorily defer an element of any Group bonus earned for the preceding financial year in exchange for which they are awarded investment shares.
They are also allowed to voluntarily invest the balance of the Group bonus subject to any cap imposed by the Remuneration Committee, currently 20% in shares.
In return, they receive a conditional award of matching shares worth a maximum of 2.5 times the pre-tax value of the bonus invested.
The value of shares for this purpose will be the average published closing price of a share for the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant of the award of shares.
The conditional awards of performance shares and matching shares only vest if a highly demanding performance condition is achieved.
For awards granted in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, the performance condition is based on the growth in the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR over a single three year performance period three consecutive financial years beginning with the year in which the grant is made relative to the growth in the TSR of a comparator group, to comprise the following 20 companies: AGA Foodservice Group, Bodycote International, Cookson Group, Domnick Hunter Group, Enodis, FKI, Halma, IMI, Kidde, Meggitt, Mitie Group, Morgan Crucible Company, Rolls-Royce, Rotork, Senior, Smiths Group, Spirax-Sarco Engineering, Tomkins, Wood Group and WS Atkins, except that Domnick Hunter Group and Kidde were not included in the comparator group for the 2006, 2007 and 2008 awards as they were fide-listed from the London Stock Exchange in December 2005 and April 2005 respectively.
Only if the Companys TSR ranks in the upper quintile of this group will the full awards vest.
This reduces on a sliding scale so that for median performance, 25% of the awards will vest.
For below median performance, none of the awards will vest.
In addition to TSR performance, for any of the performance and matching shares to vest, the growth in the Companys earnings per share over the performance period must be equal to or greater than the growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI over the same period.

The performance condition is based on earnings per share EPS subject to adjustment on a reasonable basis at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
25% of the award will vest if EPS exceeds the UK Retail Prices Index RPI by 7% p. a. increasing on a sliding scale to the full award vesting if EPS exceeds RPI by 13% p. a.

Financial assets & liabilities Financial risk management objectives & policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, liquidity and credit risk.
Details of these risks are set out in the Directors Report.
In addition, the Group is subject to a degree of interest rate risk on its borrowings.
The Group uses financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks as set out below.
Foreign exchange risk policy In respect of transactional foreign exchange risk the Group maintains a policy that all operating units eliminate exposures on material committed transactions, usually by undertaking forward foreign currency contracts through the Groups treasury function.
In addition, it is Group policy that those companies where the most significant concentration of foreign exchange risk has been identied also apply hedge accounting.
Therefore, some of the Groups forward foreign currency contracts form part of an effective cash ow hedge.
Exchange rate uctuations in respect of the forward foreign currency contracts which form part of a cash ow hedge will have an impact on shareholders equity.
Exchange rate uctuations in respect of the other forward foreign currency contracts will have an impact on profit or loss.
It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind.
In respect of translational risk the Group has a policy to partially hedge US dollar net assets exposure.
This is achieved through designating an element of US dollar borrowings, US dollar forward foreign currency contracts and US dollar cross currency swaps as net investment hedges against the Groups US dollar investments.
The Group does not hedge the translational exposure arising from profit and loss items.
Liquidity risk policy The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and exibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank loans.
Further details of the Groups borrowing facilities are disclosed in note 20. Credit risk policy The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables with risk spread over a large number of countries and customers, with no significant concentration of risk.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Credit worthiness checks are also undertaken before entering into contracts with new customers and credit limits are set as appropriate.
As shown in note 17, the trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identiable loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash ows.
The Groups exposure to the credit risk of financial institutions is limited by the adherence to counterparty limits restricted to counterparties that have a strong credit standing, based upon ratings provided by the major agencies.
Interest rate risk policy The Groups borrowings are at variable rates of interest.
Interest rate risk is regularly monitored to ensure that the mix of variable and xed rate borrowing is appropriate for the Group in the short to medium-term.
Interest rate swaps are utilised that have the economic effect of converting borrowings from oating to xed rates.
At the balance sheet date approximately 66% of our US dollar variable rate debt had been converted to xed rate through the use of oating-to-xed interest rate swaps.
Net investment in foreign operations US dollar variable rate loans included in interest-bearing loans and borrowings, amounting to US$190m 2007: US$100m, cross currency swaps of US$404m 2007: US$403m and net forward foreign currency asset contracts of US$6m 2007: liabilities of US$150m have been designated as a hedge of the Groups exposure to translational foreign exchange risk on its net investments in Weir SPM and Weir Warman.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings and the fair value of the cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in these subsidiaries.

Financial assets and liabilities continued The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax and equity through the impact on oating rate borrowings, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
There is no impact on the Groups equity, with the exception of the Groups interest rate swaps.
Effect on profit Effect on Increase before tax equity in basis gain loss gain loss points m m 2008 Australian dollar 100 -- Canadian dollar 100 0.7 - US dollar 100 3.4 2.8 UK sterling 100 2.0 - 2007 Australian dollar 100 0.7 - Canadian dollar 100 0.8 - US dollar 100 2.3 - UK sterling 100 2.1 - A decrease of 100 basis points would have an equal and opposite effect.
Effect of hedging and derivative instruments included in the income statement and equity The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge currency risk associated with expected future sales or purchases for which the Group has rm commitments.
The terms of the forward foreign currency contracts are negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
Within the Group, two subsidiaries apply cash ow hedge accounting to these transactions.
Any gains and losses on ineffective hedges were taken to the income statement in the year.
In addition, as noted above, the Group utilises interest rate swaps to convert borrowings from oating to xed rates of interest.
These interest rate swaps are subject to cash ow hedge accounting.
All other forward foreign currency contracts, while representing commercial hedges, are not subject to cash ow hedge accounting with all fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The net carrying amount, maturity dates and the amounts recognised for the period in profit or loss and equity for each derivative financial instrument are set out below.

Certain of the Groups forward foreign currency contracts subject to cash ow hedge accounting were deemed to be ineffective during the year resulting in a net charge to the income statement of 1.2m 2007: credit of 4.6m.

Foreign exchange risk The Group considers the most significant foreign exchange risk relates to the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro and US dollar.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in these foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables held constant.
The sensitivity analysis shows the effect on profit or loss in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including payables, receivables, borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts but excluding all financial assets and liabilities qualied as either cash ow or net investment hedges.
The sensitivity analysis also shows the effect on equity in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency qualied as either cash ow or net investment hedges including forward foreign currency contracts, borrowings and cross currency swaps.
The sensitivity analysis adjusts the translation of each respective financial asset or liability at the year end for a 25% strengthening of sterling against the relevant exchange rates.

The Group monitors capital using the following indicators.
Gearing ratio Gearing comprises net debt divided by total equity.
Net debt comprises cash and short-term deposits and interest-bearing loans and borrowings see note 26.
