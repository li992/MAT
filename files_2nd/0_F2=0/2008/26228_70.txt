Premiums non-participating business For those contracts where the policyholder does not have the right to vary the amount of the premium paid, full credit is taken for the premiums contractually due at the valuation date.
For contracts where the policyholder has the option to vary the rate of premium, the provision is taken as being the higher of the amount calculated as if the policyholder continues to make premium payments or, alternatively, ceases to pay premiums altogether.
Persistency non-participating business With the introduction of PS06 14 at 31 December 2006, it is permissible to value all long term business assuming a prudent lapse basis.
A prudent lapse basis was adopted for term assurance business at the end of 2006 and for unitised business at the end of 2007.
For these contracts, the valuation persistency basis is set by applying a prudential margin over the best estimate assumptions.
For term assurance business, the margin acts to increase the best estimate lapse rate in the early part of a policys lifetime when it is treated as an asset but to reduce the best estimate lapse rate later in the policys lifetime when it is treated as a liability.
The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level.
Any liability to reinsurers on discontinuance within the first four years from inception is allowed for explicitly in the cash flows, using the valuation lapse basis, together with a prudent allowance for clawback of commission from agents upon lapse.
com Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 121 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 37 Long term insurance valuation assumptions continued For unitised business, the margin acts to either increase or decrease the best estimate lapse rates, depending upon which approach results in the higher liability.
The direction of the margin is assessed for unit life business and unit pensions business separately.
