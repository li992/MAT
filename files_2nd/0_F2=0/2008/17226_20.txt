Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences between the accounting and tax cost bases that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date.
Deferred tax is calculated based on tax law enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and is provided at rates that are expected to apply when the timing differences reverse.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Stocks Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated at weighted average basis and comprises purchase price, import duties, less rebates and other non-recoverable taxes.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Share-based payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them.
The fair value of the share-based award is calculated at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
This is based on the Companys estimate of share options that will eventually vest.
This takes into account movement of non-market conditions, being service conditions and financial performance, if relevant.
The fair value of equity-settled awards granted is not subsequently revisited.

The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The latest full provisional actuarial valuations were carried out at 6 April 2007 and were updated for FRS 17 purposes for the periods to 3 February 2008 by a qualified independent actuary.
b Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes liabilities were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Rate of increases in salaries 5.00-6.00% 4.25-5.45% 4.25-5.25% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.75% 3.20% 3.00% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.75% 5.00% 4.75% Inflation assumption 3.75% 3.20% 3.00% i Longevity The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Male 23.5 19.9 19.9 Female 25.8 22.8 22.8 The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Male 22.2 19.9 19.9 Female 24.7 22.8 22.8 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice in accordance with published statistics.
The current mortality table used is PNX00 YOB LC 2007: PA92 C2020.
The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets, were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Long term rate of return on: Equities 7.00% 7.00% 7.00% Bonds 6.00% 5.00% 4.25% Property 6.00% 6.00% 7.00% Cash 5.50% 5.25% 4.50% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
c Valuations The fair values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 m m m Equities 252 288 252 Bonds 57 43 34 Gilts 60 Property 31 36 1 Cash 7 1 19 Total market value of assets 407 368 306 Present value of scheme liabilities 438 406 381 Deficit in the scheme pension liability 31 38 75 Related deferred tax asset 9 11 23 Net pension liability in the balance sheet 22 27 52 Additional information Company financial Consolidated financial Governance Financial review Operating review Chief Executives Chairmans statement statements statements and risks business review 88 Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2008 Notes to the financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 3 February 2008 40 Pension liabilities continued The movement in the deficit during the period was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 m m m Deficit in the scheme at the beginning of the period 38 75 72 Current service cost 21 24 22 Contributions 50 25 25 Other finance income 4 21 Actuarial loss gain 26 34 7 Deficit in the scheme at the end of the period 31 38 75 d Profit and loss account impact The following amounts have been charged in arriving at operating profit in respect of pension costs: 2008 2007 2006 m m m Current service cost 21 24 22 The following amounts have been included in other finance income: 2008 2007 2006 m m m Expected return on pension scheme assets 25 21 17 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 21 19 16 4 2 1 e Amounts recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses The amounts included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses were: 2008 2007 2006 m m m Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 32 16 35 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities 12 6 4 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities 6 12 46 Actuarial loss gain recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses 26 34 7 f History of experience gains and losses 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 m m m m m Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount 32 16 35 7.5 25 Percentage of scheme assets 7.9% 4.4% 11.6% 3.3% 13.9% Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities: Amount 12 6 4 2 3 Percentage of present value of scheme liabilities 2.9% 1.6% 1.1% 0.6% 1.4% Effects to changes in the demographic and financial assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities: Amount 6 12 46.6 16.9 71 Percentage of present value of scheme liabilities 1.4% 2.9% 12.2% 5.6% 28.6% Total amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses Amount 26 34 7 7.6 49 Percentage of present value of scheme liabilities 5.9% 8.4% 1.8% 2.5% 19.9% Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2008 89 40 Pension liabilities continued g Defined contribution pension scheme Employees joining the Company after September 2000 are no longer eligible to gain automatic entry into the final salary pension scheme.

At 3 February 2008, there was a credit balance of 0.4m including uncleared banking items 2007: 0.2m.
The Company has also provided a guarantee in respect of Sterling and Euro Bonds, amounting to 758m 2007: 999m in respect of a subsidiary undertaking.
In September 2007 the Office of Fair Trading issued a Statement of Objections to a number of grocery retailers and milk producers, alleging collusion in the setting of prices for certain dairy products in 2002 and 2003.
Morrisons was accused in relation to one infringement in 2002, and has vigorously denied this.
Based on the evidence put forward, the Board do not consider it probable that the Company will ultimately incur a fine, and accordingly have made no provision for any such liability.
48 Post balance sheet events The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ending 3 February 2008 of 4.125p per share which will absorb an estimated 111m of shareholders funds.
Subject to approval at the AGM, it will be paid on 6 June 2008 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 2 May 2008.
As described in the Chief Executive strategy review, the Company intends to return 500m to shareholders through a share buyback programme in the financial year ended February 2009.
