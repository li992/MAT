Retirement benefit plans Background The group offers retirement benefit plans to its employees.
The groups main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a dened contribution scheme, the BT Retirement Plan BTRP.
The total pension cost of the group for the year, included within staff costs, was 626 million 2007: 643 million, 2006: 603 million.
Dened contribution schemes The income statement charge in respect of dened contribution schemes represents the contribution payable by the group based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The total pension cost for the year in respect of the groups main dened contribution scheme was 37 million 2007: 28 million, 2006: 19 million and 3 million 2007: 3 million, 2006: 2 million of contributions were outstanding at 31 March 2008.

Retirement benefit plans continued Dened benefit schemes BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited administers and manages the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the trust deed of the BTPS, there are nine trustee directors appointed by the group, five of which appointments are made with the agreement of the relevant trade unions, including the Chairman of the Trustees.
Four trustee directors other than the Chairman are appointed by BT on the nomination of the relevant trade unions.
Two of the trustee directors will normally hold senior positions within the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualied candidate, there should be at least one current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS as one of the trustee directors.
Trustee directors are appointed for a three-year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment.
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities IAS 19 Scheme assets are measured at the bid market value at the balance sheet date.
The liabilities of the BTPS are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash ows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cash ows are discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of an equivalent term to the liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Retirement benefit plans continued The present value of the obligation is derived from long-term cash ow projections and is thus inherently uncertain.

Retirement benefit plans continued The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, xed interest and index linked securities, deposits and short-term investments.
At 31 March 2008, the UK equities included 10 million 2007: 14 million ordinary shares of the company with a market value of 22 million 2007: 43 million.
The group occupies two properties owned by the BTPS scheme on which an annual rental of 0.1 million is payable 2007: 0.1 million.
The expected returns on xed interest and interest linked securities are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year.
Expected returns on equities, property and alternative asset classes are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above yields on government bonds, consensus economic forecasts of future returns and historical returns.
Alternative asset classes include commodities and hedge funds.
During the year short-term fide-risking activities have hedged the downside risks associated with the schemes equity exposure and reduced the short-term economic exposure to equities to 39%.
The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net finance income.

No deficiency contributions are due in 2009.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure BTPS scheme liabilities The assumed discount rate, mortality rates and salary increases all have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
Retirement benefit plans continued Funding valuation and future funding obligations A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The funding valuation is performed at 31 December as this is the financial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows: scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value.
The last three triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2005 2002 1999 2005 2002 1999 valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation %%%%%%..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Discount rate Pre retirement liabilities 3.06 5.84 Post retirement liabilities 1.79 4.54 Return on existing assets, relative to market values 4.52 2.38 7.13 5.45 after allowing for an annual increase in dividends of 1.00 1.00 3.53 4.03 Return on future investments 4.00 4.00 6.60 7.12 Average increase in retail price index 2.70 2.50 3.00 a a Average future increases in wages and salaries 0.75 1.5 1.75 3.47 4.04 4.80 Average increase in pensions 2.70 2.50 3.00 a There is a short-term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 1.25% for the first three years.
At 31 December 2005, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of 34.4 billion 2002: 22.8 billion and were sufficient to cover 90.9% 2002: 91.6% of the benets accrued by that date.
This represented a funding deficit of 3.4 billion compared with 2.1 billion at 31 December 2002.
The funding valuation uses conservative assumptions whereas, had the valuation been based on the actuarys view of the median estimate basis the scheme would have been in surplus.
The market value of equity investments had increased and the investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the benets paid.
In the three years ended 31 December 2005, however, the deficit had not improved by the same amount as the assets because the liabilities included longer life expectancy assumptions and used a lower discount rate.
Following the valuation the ordinary contributions rate increased to 19.5% of pensionable salaries including employee contributions of 6% from 18.2%, with effect from 1 January 2007.
In 2008, the group made regular contributions of 380 million 2007: 402 million.
In addition, the group agreed to make deficiency payments equivalent to 280 million per annum for ten years.
The first three years instalments have been paid up front: 520 million was paid in 2007 and 320 million was paid in 2008.
Subsequently, annual payments of 280 million will be made, with the next payment due in December 2009.
This compared to annual deficiency payments of 232 million that were determined under the 2002 funding valuation.
The intention is for there to be sufficient assets in the scheme to pay pensions now and in the future.
Without any further contribution from the company, it is estimated that as at 31 December 2005, the assets of the scheme would have been sufficient to provide around 70% of the members benets with an insurance company.
If the group were to become insolvent, however, there are a number of additional protections available to members.
Firstly, there is the Crown Guarantee which was granted when the group was privatised in 1984.
This applies, on a winding up of the group, to pension entitlements for anyone who joined the scheme before 6 August 1984, and to payments to beneciaries of such persons.
Secondly, the Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the scheme and pay certain benets to members.
There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and this would not give exactly the same benets as those provided by the scheme.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS, the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years.
The agreed funding plan addresses the deficit over a period of ten years.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age prole of active members will consequently increase.
Under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active members pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment prole extends over more than 60 years.
