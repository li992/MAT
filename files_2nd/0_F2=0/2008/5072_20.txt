PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of accounting The Parent Company financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed below, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Companys profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses are not presented in these financial statements.
The eaga plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2008 contain a consolidated cash flow statement.
Consequently, the Company has taken the exemption available in FRS1 Revised 1996 Cash flow statements, and has not presented its own cash flow statement.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, including incidental expenses incurred on acquisition, less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: Long leasehold land and buildings Period of lease Alterations to leasehold property Period of lease Fixtures and fittings 20 33.3% Equipment 20 50% Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Turnover Turnover is the total amount receivable by the Company for goods and services provided, excluding value added tax and net of trade discounts, and includes contract revenue, on a gross basis, administered in respect of the central government and utility schemes.
Turnover is recognised at the point at which income is contractually due to the Company or, in the absence of any formal contractual agreement, on a cash received basis.
Pension scheme The Company operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of its employees.
The Companys contributions to these schemes, which are based on employee earnings, are recognised in the year in which the related payroll costs are incurred.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at year-end exchange rates.
Share-based payments The Company allows employees to acquire its shares through share option schemes, details of which are in the Remuneration Committee Report.
The fair value of share options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date, using an appropriate model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted, and is spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Financial instruments Debtors and creditors are non-derivative financial assets or liabilities with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
They are included within assets or liabilities at amortised cost depending on when they fall due.
