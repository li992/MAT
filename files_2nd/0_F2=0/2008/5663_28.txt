ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 119 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 1.
Principal Accounting Policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and generally accepted accounting practices in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
The comparative prior period amounts presented in the financial statements were from 8 December 2006 date of incorporation to 31 December 2007.
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is US dollars.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairment.
Investments are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of the investment exceeds the higher of net realisable value and the discounted future earnings from the investment.
Financial assets and liabilities Interest and non-interest bearing amounts owed by Group companies are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance income is accounted for on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in currencies other than US dollars, including the issue of shares, are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
IPO costs Costs related directly to the issuance of shares have been deducted from equity.
Attributable IPO costs have been allocated between the share premium and profit and loss in proportion to the number of new shares issued compared to the existing number of shares.
Other costs attributed to the listing have been expensed.
Taxation including deferred tax Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except that deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is recognised on an undiscounted basis.
Share-based payments In 2008, the Company has adopted a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP designed to reward senior management employees of the Group for achieving the Groups strategic objectives and provide an appropriate level of long-term performance related pay.
Each year, participants will receive conditional awards of shares in the Company which will normally vest three years after they are awarded.
This is subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, measured over a three-year performance period and continued service.
The share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the Companys financial statements and is measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant.
The fair value was calculated by applying the Monte Carlo model.
In accordance with UITF 44 and FRS 20, where a parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense for such compensation with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Consequently, in the financial statements of the parent, the Company is required to record an addition to the Companys investment in ENRC Management UK Limited, with a corresponding increase recognised in other reserves.
In 2007, the Company adopted an equity-settled share-based bonus award scheme for the Directors, management, senior employees and professional advisors for their contribution to the Companys preparations for admission to the London Stock Exchange.
The fair value of services received under the scheme was measured by reference to the fair value of the shares granted less par value at the grant date and was recognised in the profit and loss account.
Further details on the share-based payments can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report section of this Annual Report and notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Dividends Dividends payable are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on the balance sheet date.
Dividends are disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or when declared after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.
