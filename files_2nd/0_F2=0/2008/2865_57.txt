To remove the Groups exposure to currency fluctuations it has entered into currency swaps which effectively hedge the movement in the underlying bond fair value.
The interest rate swap is being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of GBP denominated bonds.
The combined fair value of the swaps, of 274.3m, is disclosed in note 15 Financial assets.
The sum of these items held at fair value equates to the underlying value of the Groups bond debt of 678.8m.
The asset based securitised finance movement represents the net movement on the underlying balances with customers.
