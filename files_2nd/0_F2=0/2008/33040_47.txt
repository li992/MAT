Financial commitments and contingent liabilities continued The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O2 UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on 19 November 2001.
O2 plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum exposure is US$72 million 2007: US$82 million, approximately 36 million 2007: 39 million as at 31 March 2008, although this could increase by a further US$402 million 2007: US$404 million, approximately 202 million 2007: 205 million in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until O2 UK Limited has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the group.
The European Commission formally investigated the way the UK government set BTs property rates and those paid by Kingston Communications, and whether or not the Government complied with European Community Treaty rules on state aid.
It concluded that no state aid had been granted.
The Commissions decision has now been appealed, but we continue to believe that any allegation of state aid is groundless, and that the appeal will not succeed.
