74 THE GAME GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007-2008 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 January 2008 12 INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS CONTINUED Goodwill principally relates to the GAME and Gamestation brands.
The goodwill is allocated, for impairment testing purposes, to cash-generating units as follows: 000 UK and Ireland 131,688 Other 20,394 Total 152,082 The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed on a value-in-use basis.
The key assumptions for the calculations are those regarding growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
The growth rates are based on industry forecasts, changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash ows for no more than 13 years using a steady growth rate applicable to the relevant market.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The cash ows were discounted using pre-tax discount rates between 8 per cent and 13 per cent dependent on the territories concerned and GAMEs operations in those territories.
No impairments were recognised in the year.
