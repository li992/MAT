RETiREmEnT BEnEfiT OBLiGATiOn WH Smith PLC has operated a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
The main pension arrangements for employees are operated through a defined benefit scheme, WHSmith Pension Trust, and a defined contribution scheme, WHSmith Retirement Savings Plan.
The most significant scheme is WHSmith Pension Trust, which is described in Note 6 a i.
The scheme is independent of the Company and is administered by a Trustee.
The Trustee of the Pension Trust has extensive powers over the pension plans arrangements, including the ability to determine the levels of contribution.
The scheme has been closed to new members since 1996.
As part of the acquisition of UNS Group Limited, the Group acquired its defined benefit pension scheme, United News Shops Retirement Benefits Scheme.
United News Shops Retirement Benefits Scheme had no active members at acquisition and is closed to new entrants.
The net retirement obligation at acquisition was nil see Note 18. a defined benefit pension scheme i The WHSmith Pension Trust On 2 April 2007, the WHSmith Pension Trust was closed to defined benefit service accrual.
The actuarial impact of this change on the liabilities of the WHSmith Pension Trust has been reflected in the non cash curtailment gain of 10m in the prior year.
During the year, the Group made a contribution of 10m to the WHSmith Pension Trust 2007: 10m in accordance with the agreed pension deficit funding schedule.
In the prior year the Group also made a one off contribution of 25m as part of the demerger from Smiths News PLC.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Pension Trust was carried out as at 31 March 2006 by independent actuaries, Mercer Limited, using the projected unit credit method.
In September 2005, the Pension Trust Trustee adopted a new investment policy in order to substantially reduce the volatility in the underlying investment performance and reduce the risk of a significant increase in the deficit in the fund.
The assets in the investment fund were restructured in order to adopt this policy.
This involved the assets being invested such that they are expected to alter in value in line with changes in the pension liability caused by changes in interest and inflation a Liability Driven Investment LDI policy.
WH Smith PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 54 The key features of this new investment policy were that: 96 per cent of the Pension Trusts assets were invested in an LDI policy with a leading international institutional fund manager: and 4 per cent of the Pension Trusts assets were used to purchase a portfolio of long-dated equity call options.
These represented a notional exposure to underlying equities of some 193m.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet within non-current liabilities in relation to this plan are as follows: m 2008 2007 Present value of the obligations 662 657 Fair value of plan assets 793 657 Surplus in the scheme 131 Amounts not recognised 131 Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet The pension scheme is closed to further accrual and given the LDI policy adopted by the Pension Trustees, the present value of the economic benefits of the IAS 19 surplus in the pension scheme of 131m 2007: nil available on a reduction of future contributions is nil 2007: nil.
As a result the Group has not recognised this IAS 19 surplus on the balance sheet.
On an ongoing funding basis the gross actuarial defined benefit pension deficit at 31 August 2008 for WH Smith PLC was approximately 60m approximately 43m net of related deferred taxes 2007: approximately 46m and approximately 33m net of related deferred taxes for the Pension Trust.
There is an ongoing deficit primarily due to the different assumptions and calculation methodologies used compared to those under IAS 19.
The valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme used for the IAS 19 disclosures is based upon the most recent valuation.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at the relevant reporting date.
The principal long-term assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were: % 2008 2007 Rate of increase in salaries 4.10 4.24 Rate of increase in pension payments and deferred pensions 4.07 3.24 Discount rate 6.25 5.53 Inflation assumptions 4.07 3.24 The amounts recognised in the income statement were as follows: m 2008 2007 Current service cost 4 Curtailment gain 10 Interest cost 36 34 Expected return on scheme assets 36 32 4 The charge for the current service cost and the prior year exceptional curtailment gain have been included in administrative costs.
The interest cost net of the expected return on scheme assets has been included in finance costs Note 12.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.

The fair value of inventories acquired was 2m.
Details of revenues generated have not been disclosed as the revenue generated is not material in the context of these financial statements.

Risk management The Groups Treasury function seeks to reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other financial risks, to ensure liquidity is available to meet the foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements.
The Groups treasury policies and procedures are periodically reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee and are subject to regular Group Internal Audit review.
Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital defined as net debt funds Note 27 plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
The Group has committed and uncommitted facilities with a number of financial institutions which are available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital.
Treasury has a policy of pooling group cash flows in order to maximise the return on surplus cash and also to utilise cash within the group to reduce the costs of external short-term funding.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities: Due within Due between Due between Due over 2008 m 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank loans and overdrafts 25 25 Trade and other payables 262 1 263 Finance leases 4 2 6 Total cash flows 291 2 1 294 Due within Due between Due between Due over 2007 m 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank loans and overdrafts 9 9 Trade and other payables 235 1 236 Finance leases 4 7 11 Total cash flows 248 7 1 256 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty may default on their obligation to the Group in relation to lending, hedging, settlement and other financial activities.
The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables and bank balances and cash.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The Group has a very low retail credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 WH Smith PLC 69 nOTES TO ACCOunTS COnTinuEd 30. finAnCiAL inSTRumEnTS COnTinuEd Credit risk continued The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is considered to be low, as the Board approved Group Treasury Policy limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
These limits are based on a combination of short-term credit ratings of P-1 A-1 and long-term ratings of A1 A or better.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group does not hold collateral over any of these financial assets.
interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
At 31 August 2008, the Group had drawn down 25m 2007: nil from its committed revolving credit facility.
The Group does not see this draw down as long-term in nature and has therefore not entered into interest rate derivatives to mitigate this risk.
foreign currency risk Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of the changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups foreign currency exposures are principally to the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The hedging instruments have been used to hedge purchases in US dollars and to minimise foreign exchange risk in movements of the USD GBP exchange rates.
These are designated as cash flow hedges.
At 31 August 2008, the Group had no material unhedged currency exposures.
The Groups Euro exposure is principally operational and arises through the ownership of a retail store in France.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposure.
The fair value of cash flows hedges recognised on the balance sheet within derivative assets liabilities is shown below: m 2008 2007 Fair value of derivative assets liabilities 2 1 At 31 August 2008, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group has committed is US$52m 2007: US$69m.
These instruments will be used to hedge cash flows occurring within two years of the balance sheet date.
Losses totalling 1m 2007: 2m have been transferred to both the income statement and inventories in respect of contracts that matured during the year ended 31 August 2008.
At 31 August 2008, the fair value gain on the Groups currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amounts to 3m 2007: 1m.
Sensitivity analysis as at 31 August 2008 Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates, and USD GBP and GBP Euro exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the hedging reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
Group debt and hedging activities remain constant, reflecting the positions at 31 August 2007 and 31 August 2008 respectively.
As a consequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended.
WH Smith PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 70 The above assumptions are made when illustrating the effect on the Groups income statement and equity given reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in GBP LIBOR Base Rate to be one per cent, based on interest rate history.
