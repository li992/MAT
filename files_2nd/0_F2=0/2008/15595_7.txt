The temporary difference unrecognised at the year end amounted to 1,053m 2007 565m.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items, because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 9m 2007 98m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 137m 2007 33m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 39m 2007 10m in 2011 that will expire in 2012 and 57m 2007 22m in 2027 that will expire in 2028.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at which management monitor that goodwill.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins.
Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The recoverable amounts of China, Japan and Turkey were based on fair value less costs to sell.
Fair value less costs to sell is the amount for which the cash-generating unit could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction less costs to sell.
Management undertakes an assessment of relevant market data including, where available, recent market transactions for similar assets in the retail industry.
Fair value is also calculated from cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups latest internal forecasts, including future capital expenditure, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The key assumptions for the fair value calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected changes in margins and capital expenditure.
Management estimate discount rates using post-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates of generally 3%-4% 2007: 3%-4%.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 8%-24% 2007: 10%-17%.
The post-tax discount rates used to calculate fair value less costs to sell range from 5%-20%.
These discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each geographical region.
In February 2008 and 2007 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.

Cash-generating units are tested for impairment if there are indications of impairment at the Balance Sheet date.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on value in use, which is calculated from cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term growth rates of generally 3%-4% 2007: 3%-4%.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 8%-24% 2007: 10%-17% depending on the specific conditions in which each store operates.
These discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.

Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 73 212584 TESCO REP P53 75 1 5 08 19:36 Page 74 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 20 Financial instruments Derivatives are used for hedging in the management of exposure to market risks.
This enables the optimisation of the overall cost of accessing debt capital markets, and to mitigate the market risk which would otherwise arise from the maturity and other profiles of assets and liabilities.
Hedging policies using derivative financial instruments are further explained below.
Derivatives that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as described below.
There is no material impact on the Group Income Statement resulting from hedge ineffectiveness.
Fair value hedges The Group maintains interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued by the Group.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group Income Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument and hedged item is recognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is amortised to the Group Income Statement under the effective interest rate method.
A gain of 261m on hedging instruments was recognised during the year, offset by a loss of 261m on hedged items in 2007, a loss of 13m on hedging instruments was offset by a gain of 13m on hedged items.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, mark-to-market gains and losses are deferred in equity.
The hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars.
The cash flows hedged will occur and will affect the Group Income Statement within one year of the Balance Sheet date.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Group Income Statement.
Net investment hedges The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts, currency denominated borrowings and currency options to hedge the exposure of a proportion of its non-Sterling denominated assets against changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group has a South Korean Won denominated liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, Samsung Tesco Co. Limited.
This liability has been designated as a net investment hedge of a proportion of the assets of Samsung Tesco Co. Limited.
The Group has a Chinese Yuan denominated liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, Hymall.
This liability has been designated as a net investment hedge of a proportion of the assets of Hymall.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Group Income Statement on disposal of the overseas operation.
Financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting The Groups policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes: however, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is appropriate.
These instruments include caps, collars, interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.
The Group has a liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, dunnhumby Limited.
Changes in the value of the liability are recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.

These risks are managed as described below.
The Group Balance Sheet position at 23 February 2008 is representative of the positions throughout the year.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board provides written principles for risk management, as described in the Business Review on pages 15 to 17.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Debt issued at variable rates exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Debt issued at fixed rates exposes the Group to fair value risk.
Our interest rate management policy is explained on page 17.
The Group has RPI debt where the principal is indexed to increases in the RPI index.
RPI debt is treated as floating rate debt.
The Group also has LPI debt, where the principal is indexed to RPI, with an annual maximum increase of 5% and a minimum of 0%.
LPI debt is treated as fixed rate debt.

The following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivatives.
The undiscounted cash flows will differ from both the carrying values and fair value.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the Balance Sheet date.
Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at the Balance Sheet date.
For index linked liabilities, inflation is estimated at 3% for the life of the liability.

The following analysis, required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates, and foreign exchange risk.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk principally via: a Transactional exposure, from the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
Transactional exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged.
These exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional and fair value of these contracts is shown in note 20. b Net investment exposure, from the value of net investments outside the UK.
We hedge the majority of our investments in our international subsidiaries via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are formally designated as net investment hedges.
These are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are not formally designated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset.
The impact on Group financial instruments from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity analysis below.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-employment obligations and on the retranslation of overseas net assets as required by IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
However it does include the foreign exchange sensitivity resulting from all local entity non-functional currency financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 23 February 2008.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to all financial instruments held at the Balance Sheet date.
It does not reflect any change in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity of interest payable to movements in interest rates is calculated on the post hedge floating rate net debt exposure with no sensitivity assumed for LPI-linked debt: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates or foreign exchange rates have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in foreign exchange rates are recorded directly in equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments only affect the Group Income Statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are fully effective with no impact on the Group Income Statement: debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the interest payable part of the calculation: and the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects a full 12-month period for the interest payable portion of the sensitivity calculations.
com annualreport08 78 Financial Statements 2008 212584 TESCO REP P76 108 1 5 08 19:37 Page 79 Note 21 Financial risk factors continued Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and equity that would result from changes in UK interest rates, and in the Euro to Sterling exchange rate: 2008 2007 Income Equity Income Equity gain loss gain loss gain loss gain loss m m m m Assets 1% increase in GBP interest rates 42 36 5% appreciation of the Euro 5 32 1 35 5% appreciation of the South Korean Won 19 5% appreciation of the US Dollar 2 43 1 19 5% appreciation of the Thai Baht 1 17 10% appreciation of the Czech Koruna 27 48 15% appreciation of the Polish Zloty 1 102 195 20% appreciation of the Slovak Koruna 2 87 72 The impact on equity from changing exchange rates results principally from foreign currency deals used as net investment hedges.
The impact on equity will largely be offset by the revaluation in equity of the hedged assets.
For changes in the USD GBP exchange rate, the impact on equity results principally from forward purchases of USD as cash flow hedges.
Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital defined as net debt plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while maintaining a strong credit rating and headroom whilst optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Company.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, buy back shares and cancel them or issue new shares.
In April 2006, we outlined our plan to release cash from our property assets, via a sequence of property joint ventures and other transactions, and return significant value to shareholders, either through enhanced dividends or share buy-backs.
The target for the value of share buy-backs was increased from 1.5bn to 3.0bn over a five-year period from April 2007.
We have continued with this policy throughout the current financial year, purchasing and cancelling 657m ordinary shares, taking the total to 1,042m.
The policy for debt is to ensure a smooth debt maturity profile with the objective of ensuring continuity of funding.
This policy continued during the current year with bonds redeemed of 447m and new bonds issued totalling 2,034m.
The Group borrows centrally and locally, using a variety of capital market issues and borrowing facilities to meet the requirements of each local business.

The total Group Income Statement charge for the year recognised in respect of share-based payments is 228m 2007 209m, which is made up of share option schemes and share bonus payments.
Of this amount 199m 2007 185m will be equity-settled and 29m 2007 24m cash-settled.
a Share option schemes The Company had nine share option schemes in operation during the year, all of which are equity-settled schemes: i The savings-related share option scheme 1981 permits the grant to employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between 5 and 250 per four-weekly period.
Options are capable of being exercised at the end of the three or five-year period at a subscription price not less than 80% of the average of the middle-market quotations of an ordinary share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the offer date.
ii The Irish savings-related share option scheme 2000 permits the grant to Irish employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between 12 and 320 per four-weekly period.
iii The Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 was adopted on 17 October 1994.
The exercise of options granted under this scheme will normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period.
No further options will be granted under this scheme and it has been replaced by the discretionary share option plan 2004.
There were no discounted options granted under this scheme.
iv The Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 was adopted on 7 June 1996.
v The International Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 was adopted on 20 May 1994.
This scheme permits the grant to selected non-UK executives of options to acquire ordinary shares on substantially the same basis as their UK counterparts.
The exercise of options granted under this scheme will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target related to the growth in earnings per share over a three-year period.
vi The Executive Incentive Plan 2004 was adopted on 5 July 2004.
This scheme permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration.
vii The Performance Share Plan 2004 was adopted on 5 July 2004 and amended on 29 June 2007.
Options granted before 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between four and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration.
Options granted after 29 June 2007 are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant for nil consideration.
The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed over a three-year period.
viii The Discretionary Share Option Plan 2004 was adopted on 5 July 2004.
This scheme permits the grant of approved, unapproved and international options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant at a price not less than the middle-market quotation or average middle-market quotations of an ordinary share for the dealing day or three dealing days preceding the date of grant.
The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target related to the annual percentage growth in earnings per share over a three-year period.
There will be no discounted options granted under this scheme.
ix The Group New Business Incentive Plan 2007 was adopted on 29 June 2007.
Options will normally vest in four tranches: four, five, six and seven years after the date of grant and will be exercisable for up to two years from the vesting dates for nil consideration.
The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed over the seven-year plan.
The average share price during the year to 23 February 2008 was 443.59p 2007 369.70p.
The fair value of share options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The following table gives the assumptions applied to the options granted in the respective periods shown.
No assumption has been made to incorporate the effects of expected early exercise.

The measure of volatility used in Tesco PLC option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a period of time.
In estimating the future volatility of the Companys share price, the Board consider the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected term of the option, taking into account the remaining contractual life of the option.
b Share bonus schemes Eligible UK employees are able to participate in Shares in Success, an all-employee profit-sharing scheme.
Each year, shares are awarded as a percentage of earnings up to a statutory maximum of 3,000.
Senior management also participate in performance-related bonus schemes.
The amount paid to employees is based on a percentage of salary and is paid partly in cash and partly in shares.
Bonuses are awarded to eligible employees who have completed a required service period and depend on the achievement of corporate targets.
The accrued cash element of the bonus at the Balance Sheet date is 26m 2007 17m.
Selected senior management participate in the senior management Performance Share Plan.
Awards made under this plan will normally vest three years after the date of the award for nil consideration.
Vesting will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed over a three year performance period.
Senior management in the US business also participate in the US Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 which was adopted on 29 June 2007.
The awards made under this Plan will normally vest in four tranches: four, five, six and seven years after the date of award, for nil consideration.
Vesting will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed in the US business over the seven-year plan.
The Executive Directors participate in short-term and long-term bonus schemes designed to align their interests with those of shareholders.
Full details of these schemes can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The fair value of shares awarded under these schemes is their market value on the date of award.
Expected dividends are not incorporated into the fair value except for awards under the US Long-Term Incentive Plan.

The most significant of these are the funded defined benefit pension schemes for the Groups employees in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
Defined contribution plans The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 8m 2007 7m have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
Defined benefit plans United Kingdom The principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme, which is a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the assets of which are held as a segregated fund and administered by trustees.
Watson Wyatt Limited, an independent actuary, carried out the latest triennial actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 31 March 2005, using the projected unit method.
At the date of the last actuarial valuation the actuarial deficit was 153m.
The market value of the schemes assets was 2,632m and these assets represented 95% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
The One Stop Senior Executive Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme open to senior executives and certain other employees at the invitation of the Company.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 5 April 2004.
Overseas The most significant overseas scheme is the funded defined benefit pension scheme which operates in the Republic of Ireland.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 1 April 2007.
The valuations used for IAS 19 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Watson Wyatt Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 23 February 2008.
The schemes assets are stated at their market values as at 23 February 2008.
Watson Wyatt Limited have updated the most recent Republic of Ireland valuation.
The liabilities relating to retirement healthcare benefits have also been determined in accordance with IAS 19, and are incorporated in the following tables.
Principal assumptions The valuations used have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Watson Wyatt Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 23 February 2008.
The major assumptions, on a weighted average basis, used by the actuaries were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 % %% Rate of increase in salaries 5.0 4.5 4.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.5 3.0 2.7 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.5 3.0 2.7 Rate of increase in career average benefits 3.5 3.0 2.7 Discount rate 6.4 5.2 4.8 Price inflation 3.5 3.0 2.7 In excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP element.
The main financial assumption is the real discount rate i. e. the excess of the discount rate over the rate of price inflation.
If this assumption increased decreased by 0.1%, the UK defined benefit obligation would decrease increase by approximately 115m and the annual UK current service cost would decrease increase by approximately 13m.
UK mortality assumptions The Company conducts analysis of mortality trends under the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme in the UK as part of the triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme.
At the latest triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2005, the following assumptions were adopted for funding purposes: Base tables: PMA92C00 for male members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be two years older than actual age.
PFA92C00 for female members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be half a year older than actual age.
Additionally, at the 31 March 2005 valuation an allowance was built in for future mortality improvements via a 0.2% reduction to the discount rate.
These assumptions were used for the calculation of the pension liabilities as at 25 February 2006 and 24 February 2007 for the main UK scheme.
At 23 February 2008, the mortality assumptions have been strengthened.
The base mortality tables detailed above have been updated in line with medium cohort improvements from 31 March 2005 to 23 February 2008.
In addition, the allowance for future mortality improvements has been changed to incorporate medium cohort improvements in the future.

The expected rate of return on equities and cash have both been set having regard to expected returns over the medium term, as calculated by the Companys independent actuary.
The expected rate of return on bonds was measured directly from actual yields for gilts and corporate bond stocks.
The above rate takes into account the actual mix of UK gilts, UK corporate bonds and overseas bonds held at the Balance Sheet date.

Accordingly, the assumptions made in calculating the Groups defined benefit pension liability have been revised, resulting in a gain of 250m being recognised in Group operating profit in 2006 7.
Revisions to this assumption will be reflected in the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.

The liability as at 23 February 2008 of 11m 2007 11m was determined in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
In 2007 8, 0.6m 2007 0.5m has been charged to the Group Income Statement and 0.7m 2007 0.6m of benefits were paid.

The purpose of the valuation is to agree a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The actuarial valuation of approved schemes as at 31 March 2008 is currently taking place and until the valuation is concluded, contributions will continue as agreed at the 2005 funding plan.
On this basis the Group expects to make contributions of approximately 370m to defined benefit pension schemes in the year ending 28 February 2009.

Merger reserve The merger reserve arose on the acquisition of Hillards PLC in 1987.
Share buy-back liability Insider trading rules prevent the Group from buying backTesco PLC shares in the market during specified close periods including the period between the year end and the annual results announcement.
However, if an irrevocable agreement is signed between the Company and a third party, they can continue to buy back shares on behalf of the Company.
Three such arrangements were in place at the year end and in accordance with IAS 32, the Company has recognised a financial liability equal to the estimated value of the shares purchasable under these agreements.
A liability of 100m 2007 90m has been recognised within other payables for this amount.

The net assets and results of the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated accounts of the Group from the date of acquisition.
Acquisition accounting has been applied and the goodwill arising has been capitalised and is subject to annual impairment testing.
The goodwill acquired in the business combinations listed below has been allocated to the single group of cash-generating units represented by the acquired businesses, as this is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored internally.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year is attributable mainly to location, the assembled workforce and the synergies expected to be achieved.
The fair values currently established for acquisitions made in the year to 23 February 2008 are provisional.
Fair values will be reviewed based on additional information up to one year from the date of acquisition.
The Directors do not believe that any net adjustments resulting from such a review would have a material effect on the Group.
Dobbies Garden Centres PLC In 2007, the Group acquired 65.5% of the share capital of Dobbies Garden Centres PLC, a retailer in the United Kingdom.

Dobbies Garden Centres PLC remains listed on the Alternative Investment Market, and therefore we are unable to disclose information until it has been released to the market.
The results of Dobbies Garden Centres PLC are not material in the context of the Group.
Other acquisitions The other acquisitions in the year include the share capital of Telegraph Properties Kirkby Limited and The PC Guys Limited.
The companies acquired undertake activities including property management and IT services.
In addition the Group acquired the remaining share capital of Nutri Centres Limited, changing it from a joint venture to a subsidiary undertaking.
The activity undertaken by Nutri Centres Limited is retailing.

On 24 January 2007 Tesco Stores Malaysia Sdn Bhd acquired 100% of the share capital of Makro Cash and Carry Distribution Sdn Bhd, which operated a chain of eight stores in Malaysia.
The provisional fair value of assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition was included in the financial statements at 24 February 2007.
During the financial period ended 23 February 2008 and within 12 months of the date of acquisition, we restated the fair value of assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition principally due to the inclusion of an independent valuation of freehold and leasehold property.
Based on exchange rates at the date of transaction this led to a decrease in goodwill of 3m.
This reduction comprised an increase in the fair value of property, plant and equipment of 12m, decrease in trade and other receivables of 7m and an increase in trade and other payables of 2m.

Note 31 Commitments and contingencies Capital commitments At 23 February 2008 there were commitments for capital expenditure contracted for, but not provided, of 1,309m 2007 2,003m, principally relating to the store development programme.
Contingent liabilities The Company has irrevocably guaranteed the liabilities, as defined in Section 5 c of the Republic of Ireland Amendment Act 1986, of various subsidiary undertakings incorporated in the Republic of Ireland.
Tesco Personal Finance, in which the Group owns a 50% joint venture share, has commitments, as described in its own financial statements as at 31 December 2007, of formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend, totalling 5.9bn 2007 5.5bn.
The amount is intended to provide an indication of the volume of business transacted and not of the underlying credit or other risks.
For details of assets held under finance leases, which are pledged as security for the finance lease liabilities, see note 11.
There are a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business which if realised are not expected to result in a material liability to the Group.
The Group recognises provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not a settlement will be required and the value of such a payment can be reliably estimated.
In September 2007, the Office of Fair Trading issued its provisional findings in its Statement of Objections relating to the alleged collusion between certain large supermarkets and dairy processors.
We continue to defend our case vigorously.
No provision has been recognised in the Groups results.

The leases have varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
Operating lease commitments with joint ventures Since 1988, the Group has entered into several joint ventures and sold and leased back properties to and from these joint ventures.
The terms of these sale and leasebacks vary, however, common factors include: the sale of the properties to the joint venture at market value, options at the end of the lease for the Group to repurchase the properties at market value, market rent reviews and 20-25 year lease terms.
The Group reviews the substance as well as the form of the arrangements when making the judgement as to whether these leases are operating or finance leases: the majority of the leases under these arrangements are operating leases.
Operating lease receivables Group as lessor The Group both rents out its investment properties and also sublets various leased buildings under operating leases.

Dobbies Garden Centres PLC will seek shareholder approval at an Annual General Meeting on 21 May 2008 to issue up to 12.45 million shares on a six for five basis at 1,200p per share.
Tesco PLC will underwrite the offer.

The Groups charges for interest and tax have been reduced by these amounts.
4 Consists of the net result of the Taiwanese business which was sold during 2006 7.
5 UK GAAP underlying profit excluded net profit loss on disposal of fixed assets, integration costs and goodwill amortisation.
IFRS underlying profit excludes IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments Fair value remeasurements, the IAS 19 Income Statement charge, which is replaced by the normal cash contributions for pensions, and IAS 17 Leases impact of annual uplifts in rent and rent-free periods.
For further details of this measure, see page 51.
For the years 2004 to 2005 the above information is presented under UK GAAP as previously published.
