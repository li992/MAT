Accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Leases Leases of property, plant and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other payables.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate of interest costs charged to the income statement on the outstanding balance.
The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the assets useful life and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than 90 days that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derivative financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposures to foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk and changes in fuel prices to acceptable levels.
All derivatives are initially recognised at fair value, and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are accounted for in line with the nature of the hedging arrangement.
Derivatives are intended to be highly effective in mitigating the above risks, and hedge accounting is adopted where the required hedge documentation is in place and the relevant test criteria are met.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Foreign currency exchange risk Derivatives are entered into in order to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.
The group also uses foreign currency debt to hedge foreign currency exposures.
Both the derivatives and debt are designated as hedges of net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
Interest rate and fuel price risk Derivative instruments are used to manage the groups exposure to changes in cash flows arising from movements in interest rates and fuel prices.
The derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges, and hedge accounting is used where it has been shown that the hedge relationship is highly effective.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Dividend distribution Dividend distributions to the companys shareholders are recognised in the groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are paid.

Goodwill is allocated across multiple cash generating units and the amount allocated to each unit is not significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.

Credit limits are in place for customers, many of which are local authorities or local transport authorities.
Due to the nature of certain contractual arrangements, particularly where the agreement and settlement of allocations of passenger revenues between multiple service providers can take more than one year to complete, certain customer debts can often exceed one year before settlement.
This is common, and the incidence of impairment of such debt is both rare and immaterial.
Due to the immaterial level of the provision for impairment of receivables as detailed above, no further disclosure is made.

Retirement benefit obligations At 31 December 2008 the group operated a number of retirement benefit schemes, both defined benefit and defined contribution, which are financed through separate Trustee administered funds managed by independent professional fund managers on behalf of the Trustees.
Contributions to the defined benefit funds are based upon actuarial advice following the most recent of a regular series of valuations of the funds by their representative independent actuaries.
Certain employees of Arriva Merseyside Limited participate in the Local Government Pension Scheme.
This is a defined benefit scheme funded by payments to the Merseyside Pension Fund.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Merseyside Pension Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2007.
Certain employees of Arriva Trains Wales Limited and XC Trains Limited, participate in funded defined benefit sections which form part of the overall Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
Total pension cost The total pension cost for the group was 47.6 million 2007: 44.1 million.
The pension costs in respect of the group's defined contribution schemes was 32.4 million 2007: 25.8 million.
Defined benefit plans The directors believe that separate consideration should be given to the RPS under IAS19 as the group has no rights or obligations in respect of sections of this scheme following the expiry of the franchises.
The amounts relating to the rail schemes are therefore shown separately and relate to sections in respect of Arriva Trains Wales Limited and XC Trains Limited only.
The calculations used to assess the IAS19 liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes are based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated to 31 December 2008 by qualified independent actuaries, KPMG LLP.
The schemes' assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2008.

The directors assessment of the expected returns is based on historical return trends, the forward looking views of financial markets suggested by the yields available and the views of investment organisations.
The actual loss on plan assets was 230.5 million 2007: return 51.2 million.
