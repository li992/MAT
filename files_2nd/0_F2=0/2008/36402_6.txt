06 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2008 Leasing developments profitably Leasing vacant space created through developments, refurbishments or from the departure of old tenants is a critical Group competence.
In the last year, an exceptional performance delivered 25.0 million of new leases our share 19.8 million, up 155% from the previous year and representing over 26% of the rent roll of the portfolio at the start of the year.
Of particular success has been letting of completed development schemes where our leasing teams have worked well with external agents to bring top quality tenants into new homes.
At 60 Great Portland Street, W1 and 160 Tooley Street, SE1 we pre-let all the office space prior to the completion of the construction phase to derisk the development projects.
Within a year of launching the nearly completed 180 Great Portland Street, W1 we had completed the office lettings at rental levels substantially higher than at the commencement of the campaign.

This 66,000 sq ft building has always been popular, but its restrictive entrance and inefficient core meant that it never attracted mainstream tenants.
As a result rents were only just higher than 30 per sq ft on average across the floors despite the building being only a few hundred yards from Oxford Circus.
The external refurbishment involved repositioning of the main entrance and core from Great Titchfield Street into a redesigned courtyard, providing the building with an entrance and core of a scale suitable for the building.
In addition, 25,000 sq ft of the office space was opened up and refurbished to provide light, bright contemporary office space capable of attracting premium tenants.
The revitalised building rapidly gained new occupiers prepared to pay higher rents resulting in an average rent of over 47 per sq ft being secured, up 55%.

Purchased in 2003, the building was comprehensively refurbished and let to a wide range of business services and media tenants.
We concluded the sale of the building for 107 million in September 2007 generating a post tax return on capital of 156%.
The proceeds were redeployed across our business to fund the growth engines of our portfolio.

Following these transactions a significant swap deal was executed with The Crown Estate involving 55% of the JVs assets to release immediate value and unlock future potential.
These properties will now provide us with a steady pipeline for repositioning.
