Share Incentive Plan SIP The Committee has decided that corporate performance objectives must be achieved to justify an award of Free Shares, up to a maximum value of 3,000 for each participating employee, including the Executive Directors.
The Committees view is that the level of corporate performance achieved in 2008 should result in an allocation of Free Shares to the value of 2,300 to each participating employee.
Long Term Share Incentive Plan 2006 The targets set for the first and second cycles which started on 1 January 2006 and 2007 respectively were set out in the 2007 Annual Report and Accounts.
The targets for the first cycle, which ended on 31 December 2008, have not been attained.
Consequently, the share awards made in respect of the first cycle have lapsed.
Performance in respect of the first two years of the second cycle 2007 and 2008 is currently below the threshold level.
Performance against the objectives for the whole of the second cycle will be measured as at 31 December 2009 and the Committee will make a decision about the release of shares to participants as soon as practicable thereafter.
Long Term Share Incentive Plan 2008 The LTIP 2008 is designed to provide Executive Directors, senior management and other employees who make a significant contribution to the business with a powerful equity incentive to enhance the value of the business, as measured by the attainment of demanding performance targets linked to the achievement of the Companys strategic business goals.
No shares may be released to participants unless the Company achieves compound annual TSR of not less than 12%.
The Companys TSR is the rate of return generated by the cash flows from an investment in a share assuming that the share is bought at 792.0 pence, being the closing price of a share on 31 December 2007, and is sold at the average of the closing prices for a share for each of the business days in December of the latest financial year of the performance period, and having taken into account any dividends paid to ordinary shareholders in the Company and any capital variations during the performance period.
The LTIP 2008 has been designed to coincide with the next three to four year phase of the Companys business strategy and the performance measures represent the key performance indicators reflecting both operational requirements and shareholders interests and the targets represent the Committees best view at the time the targets were set of the range of performance which the Company might reasonably be expected to achieve in relation to those KPIs over the above period.
The Remuneration Committee has set performance targets in respect of three key measures of the Companys strategic performance, as follows: Proven and Production Probable Reserves Annualised TSR boepd MMboe Compound % Target 90,000 425 15 Stretch 100,000 475 20 Exceptional 115,000 550 25 One-third of the shares, subject to a provisional award, is attributable to each of the above additional performance measures.
