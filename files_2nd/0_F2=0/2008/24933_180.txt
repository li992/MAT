Progressively, HSBC has been moving to defined contribution plans for all new employees.
The pension cost for defined contribution plans, which cover 50 per cent of HSBCs employees, was US$508 million 2007: US$485 million: 2006: US$456 million.
Both HSBCs and, where relevant and appropriate, the trustees long-term investment objectives for defined benefit plans are: to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the plans over the long-term: and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of the defined benefit plans.
Both HSBC and, where relevant and appropriate, the trustees, consider that the investment policy should be consistent with meeting their mutual overall long-term investment objectives.
In pursuit of these long-term objectives, a benchmark is established for the allocation of the defined benefit plan assets between asset classes.
In addition, each permitted asset class has its own benchmarks, such as stock market or property valuation indices and desired levels of out-performance where relevant.
This is intended to be reviewed at least triennially within 18 months of the date at which the actuarial valuation is made, or more frequently if circumstances or local legislation so require.
The process generally involves an extensive asset and liability review.
Most of the Groups defined benefit plans, which cover 36 per cent of HSBCs employees, are funded plans with assets which, in the case of most of the larger plans, are held in trust or similar funds separate from HSBC.
The plans are reviewed at least annually or in accordance with local practice and regulations by qualified actuaries.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligations and related current service costs vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which they are situated.
The largest plan exists in the UK, where the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme covers employees of HSBC Bank plc and certain other employees of HSBC.
This plan comprises a funded defined benefit plan the principal plan which is closed to new entrants, and a defined contribution plan which was established on 1 July 1996 for new employees.
The principal plan holds a diversified portfolio of investments to meet future cash flow liabilities arising from accrued benefits as they fall due to be paid.
The Trustee of the principal plan is required to produce a written 364 Statement of Investment Principles SIP.
The SIP sets out the principles governing how decisions about investments are made.
In 2006, HSBC and the Trustee of the principal plan agreed to change the investment strategy in order to reduce the investment risk.
This involved switching from a largely equity-based strategy to a strategy largely based on holding bonds together with a more diverse range of investments.
The principal plan committed to undertake a programme including entering into swap arrangements whereby the principal plan is committed to making LIBOR-related interest payments in exchange for cash flows paid into the plan, based on a projection of the future benefit payments from the principal plan.
At 31 December 2008, this strategy was substantially in place and details of the swap arrangements are included in Note 43.
The latest actuarial investigation of the principal plan was made at 31 December 2005.
At that date, the market value of the HSBC Bank UK Pension Schemes assets was US$18,072 million including assets relating to the defined benefit plan, the defined contribution plan, and additional voluntary contributions.
The market value of the plan assets represented 89 per cent of the amount expected to be required, on the basis of the assumptions adopted, to provide the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings, and the resulting deficit amounted to US$2,065 million.
The method adopted for this investigation was the projected unit method.
The expected cash flows from the plan were projected by reference to the Retail Price Index RPI swap break-even curve at 31 December 2005.
Salary increases were assumed to be 1 per cent per annum above RPI and inflationary pension increases, subject to a minimum of zero per cent and a maximum of 5 per cent, were assumed to be in line with RPI.
The projected cash flows were discounted at the LIBOR swap curve at 31 December 2005 plus a margin for the expected return on the investment strategy of 110 basis points per annum.
The mortality experience of the plans pensioners over the three year period since the previous valuation was analysed and the mortality assumption set on the basis of this with allowances for medium cohort improvements on the PA92 series of tables from the valuation date.
In anticipation of the results of the 2005 investigation, on 22 December 2005 HSBC Bank plc made an additional contribution of US$1,746 million to the principal plan in order to reduce the deficit of the plan.
The amount for 2007 was paid in March 2007, and is shown above at the exchange rate at that time.
HSBC considers that the contributions set out above are sufficient to meet the deficit as at 31 December 2005 over the agreed period.
HSBC Bank plc also decided to make ongoing contributions to the principal plan in respect of the accrual of benefits of defined benefit section members at the rate of 36 per cent of pensionable salaries from 1 January 2007, until the completion of the next actuarial valuation, due as at 31 December 2008.
During 2006 HSBC paid contributions at the rate of 20 per cent of pensionable salaries.
A further 2 per cent of pensionable salaries is being paid over the period 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2014 to make good the difference in contributions during 2006.
365 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Note 8 The Trustee and the bank will monitor progress towards closing the deficit and reassess the deficit in the light of the triennial valuation that is currently being performed as at 31 December 2008.
This valuation process is currently underway and is due to be completed no later than 31 March 2010.
Future funding commitments will be determined on conclusion of the actuarial valuation.
As part of the 31 December 2005 valuation, calculations were also carried out as to the amount of assets that might be needed to meet the liabilities if the plan was discontinued and the members benefits bought out with an insurance company although in practice this may not be possible for a plan of this size or the Trustee continued to run the plan without the support of HSBC.
The amount required under this approach was estimated at 31 December 2005 to be US$26,700 million.
In estimating the solvency position for this purpose, a more prudent assumption about future mortality was made than for the assessment of the ongoing position and it was assumed that the Trustee would alter the investment strategy to be an appropriately matched portfolio of cash and interest and inflation swaps.
An explicit allowance for expenses was also included.
The benefits payable from the defined benefit plan are expected to be as shown in the chart below: Benefit payments US$m 1,600 1,400 1,200 1,000 800 600 400 200 0 2009 2019 2029 2039 2049 2059 2069 2079 2089 2099 In Hong Kong, the HSBC Group Hong Kong Local Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme covers employees of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and certain other employees of HSBC Group.
The scheme comprises a funded defined benefit scheme which provides a lump sum on retirement but is now closed to new members and a defined contribution scheme.
The latter was established on 1 January 1999 for new employees.
The latest valuation of the defined benefit scheme was made at 31 December 2007.
At that valuation date, the market value of the defined benefit schemes assets was US$1,183 million.
On an ongoing basis, the actuarial value of the schemes assets represented 119 per cent of the actuarial present value of the benefits accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in salaries, and the resulting surplus amounted to US$192 million.
On a wind-up basis, the schemes assets represents 125 per cent of the members vested benefits, based on current salaries, and the resulting surplus amounted to US$237 million.
The attained age method has been adopted for the valuation and the major assumptions used in this valuation were a discount rate of 6 per cent per annum and long-term salary increases of 5 per cent per annum.
The HSBC North America U. S. Retirement Income Plan covers employees of HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Finance, and certain other employees of HSBC USA.
It comprises a final average pay plan now closed to new participants and a cash balance plan.
All new employees participate in the cash balance plan.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the plan was made at 1 January 2008.
At that date, the actuarial value of the plan's assets was equal to market value of US$2,616 million.
The assets represented 105 per cent of the benefits accrued to members as valued under the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 that was effective for the plan year beginning 1 January 2008.
The resulting surplus amounted to US$122 million.
The method employed for this valuation was the projected unit method and the discount rate was determined using a full yield curve method, which resulted in an effective interest rate of 6.4 per cent per annum.
The HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme, The HSBC Group Hong Kong Local Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme, and the HSBC North America U. S. Retirement Income Plan cover 35 per cent of HSBCs employees.
366 HSBC healthcare benefits plans HSBC also provides post-employment healthcare benefits under plans in the UK, the US, Canada, Mexico, France and Brazil, the majority of which are unfunded.
Post-employment healthcare benefits plans are accounted for in the same manner as defined benefit pension plans.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and related current service cost vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which they are situated.
Total healthcare cost was US$13 million 2007: US$33 million: 2006: US$62 million.
Post-employment defined benefit plans principal actuarial financial assumptions The principal actuarial financial assumptions used to calculate the Groups obligations under its defined benefit pension and post-employment healthcare plans at 31 December 2008, were as follows.
The principal actuarial financial assumptions used to calculate the Groups obligations under its defined benefit pension and post-employment healthcare plans at 31 December 2007, were as follows.
367 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Notes on the Financial Statements continued Note 8 The principal actuarial financial assumptions used to calculate the Groups obligations under its defined benefit pension and post-employment healthcare plans at 31 December 2006, were as follows.
HSBC determines the discount rates to be applied to its obligations in consultation with the plans local actuaries, on the basis of current average yields of high quality AA rated or equivalent debt instruments, with maturities consistent with those of the defined benefit obligations.
In countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds, government bond yields have been used.
The yield curve has been extrapolated where the term of the liabilities is longer than the duration of available bonds and the discount rate used then takes into account the term of the liabilities and the shape of the yield curve.
When determining the discount rate with reference to a bond index, an appropriate index for the specific region has been used.
The expected return on plan assets represents the best estimate of long-term future asset returns, which takes into account historical market returns plus additional factors such as the current rate of inflation and interest rates.
Mortality assumptions are increasingly significant in measuring the Groups obligations under its defined benefit pension and post-employment healthcare plans, particularly given the maturity of the plans.
2 PNA00 year of birth and medium cohort with 1 per cent improvement thereafter.
3 3.5 per cent load, additional 5.0 per cent load for future mortality improvements.
2 PA92 year of birth with medium cohort improvements.
Actuarial assumption sensitivities The discount rate is sensitive to changes in market conditions arising during the reporting period.
The mortality rates used are sensitive to experience from the plan member profile.
Plan assets include US$52 million 2007: US$86 million of equities issued by HSBC and US$2,206 million 2007: US$572 million of other assets issued by HSBC.
The fair value of plan assets includes derivatives entered into with the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme with a positive fair value of US$1,779 million at 31 December 2008 2007: US$248 million positive fair value and US$388 million positive fair value 2007: US$63 million positive fair value in respect of the HSBC International Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme.
Further details of these swap arrangements are included in Note 43.
HSBC expects to make US$588 million of contributions to defined benefit pension plans during 2009.
Total cumulative actuarial losses recognised in equity at 31 December 2008 were US$1,076 million 2007: gains of US$563 million.
The total effect of the limit on plan surpluses recognised within actuarial losses in equity during 2008 was a US$41 million gain excluding exchange differences of US$5 million 2007: US$42 million loss excluding exchange differences of US$4 million.
HSBC expects to make US$4 million 2007: US$18 million of contributions to post-employment healthcare benefit plans during 2009.
Total cumulative net actuarial gains recognised in equity at 31 December 2008 were US$11 million 2007: gains of US$27 million.
The actuarial assumptions of the healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts recognised.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects on amounts recognised in 2008: 2008 2007 1% increase 1% decrease 1% increase 1% decrease US$m US$m US$m US$m Increase decrease of the aggregate of the current service cost and interest cost.................................... 9 7 14 10 Increase decrease of defined benefit obligation........ 77 62 110 100 HSBC Holdings Employee compensation and benefit expense in respect of HSBC Holdings employees in 2008 amounted to US$218 million 2007: US$257 million.
The average number of persons employed by HSBC Holdings during 2008 was 730 2007: 595.
Employees of HSBC Holdings who are members of defined benefit pension plans are principally members of either the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme or the HSBC International Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme.
HSBC Holdings pays contributions to plans in accordance with schedules determined by the Trustees following consultation with qualified actuaries.
The provision at 31 December 2008 in respect of unfunded pension obligations to former Directors amounted to US$15,164,791 2007: US$18,491,117.
During the year, aggregate contributions to pension schemes in respect of Directors were US$664,174 2007: US$545,854 which included US$460,564 arising from a Directors waiver of bonus.
