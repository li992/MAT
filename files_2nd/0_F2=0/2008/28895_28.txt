Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs as follows: 2008 2007 m m UK 55 43 International 239 175 Emerging Markets 50 45 When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cashflow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
Cashflows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates which do not exceed the long term average past growth rate for the insurance business in which the CGU operates.
A number of other assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of a cashflow model to forecast operating cashflows, premium volumes, expenses and working capital requirements.
Forecasts of future cashflows are based on the best estimates of future premiums, operating expenses using historical trends, general geographical market conditions, industry trends and forecasts and other available information.
These assumptions are subject to review by management and the Group Audit Committee.
The cashflow forecasts are adjusted by appropriate discount rates.
Discount rates used are within a range of 8% to 16% 2007: 10% to 15%, are pre tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments at the date of evaluation.
The weighted average growth rates used in 2008 are within a range of 0.9% to 3.5% 2007: 0.9% to 3%.
No impairments have been recognised during the year, or in prior years.

During 2007, Codan A S purchased 24m of its own shares on the market.
In addition, the Group launched a voluntary conditional public tender offer for the acquisition of all the outstanding issued shares and voting rights in Codan A S. As a result the Group acquired sufficient shareholding to effect a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares and, as the transaction is not reversible, to account for 100% of the subsidiary.
The two transactions reduced minority interests by 246m and shareholders funds by 368m.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | | Annual Report and Accounts 2008 RSA 103 Ordinary and preference shares During the year 24,707,235 2007: 12,448,823 ordinary shares were issued on the exercise of employee share options for a cash consideration of 19m 2007: 9m.
The Parent Company also issued 51,770,891 2007: 66,632,200 ordinary shares during the year under the scrip scheme as approved by shareholders.
During 2007, to fund the acquisition of Codan A S the Parent Company issued 186,350,000 ordinary shares in a placing raising gross proceeds of approximately 300m.
The placing was made through a company established specifically for the placing.
The placing was structured in such a way as to enable the Parent Company to obtain merger relief on the issue of the placing shares in accordance with section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
The effect of this is to relieve the Parent Company of a requirement to credit any amount paid up on the shares in excess of their nominal value to a share premium account.
This excess was therefore recognised in retained earnings.
The total nominal value of ordinary shares issued during the year was 20m 2007: 74m.
2008 2007 m m Authorised 4,250,000,000 ordinary shares of 27.5p each 2007: 3,923,636,364 ordinary shares of 27.5p each 1,169 1,079 300,000,000 preference shares of 1 each 2007: 300,000,000 preference shares of 1 each 300 300 Issued and fully paid 3,329,435,791 ordinary shares of 27.5p each 2007: 3,252,957,665 ordinary shares of 27.5p each 915 895 125,000,000 preference shares of 1 each 2007: 125,000,000 preference shares of 1 each 125 125 1,040 1,020 The Royal & SunAlliance ESOP Trust holds ordinary shares in the Parent Company, which may subsequently be transferred to employees other than the executive directors.

Rights attaching to the shares The rights attaching to each class of share may be varied with the consent of the holders of 75% of the issued shares of that class.
Preference shareholders shall not have any right to receive notice of, attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the Parent Company unless: r The preferential dividend on such shares for the dividend payment period immediately prior to the issue of the notice is in arrears or if any arrears of deficiency of dividend in respect of any preceding period has not been paid in full r A resolution is proposed varying the rights attached to preference shares, for the winding up of the Parent Company or for a reduction of capital in the Parent Company in which case preference shareholders may only vote on such resolution r In such other circumstances as the directors may determine prior to the allotment of any preference shares.
The Parent Company in general meeting may by ordinary resolution declare dividends, but no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the directors or permitted by law.
The directors may also pay such interim dividends as they think fit and pay the fixed dividends payable on any shares of the Parent Company half yearly or otherwise on fixed dates.
Subject to shareholder approval, the directors may allow shareholders to receive new ordinary shares in lieu of dividends paid in cash.
Provided a resolution of the Board exists, and in priority to any payment of dividend to other shareholders other than any dividend not exceeding 0.1p per share, holders of preference shares are entitled to a cumulative preferential dividend of 7.375% per annum, payable out of the profits available for distribution, to be distributed in half yearly instalments and the shares are not redeemable.
Preference shareholders have no further right to participate in the profits of the Parent Company.
In addition, preference shares do not confer: r Any right to participate in any offer by way of rights or otherwise to subscribe for additional shares in the Parent Company except where required by law r Any rights of conversion r Any right to participate in any issue of bonus shares.

Equity and reserves continued The directors may deduct from any dividend or other monies payable to any shareholder all sums of money presently payable by him to the Parent Company on account of calls or otherwise in relation to his shares in the Parent Company.
If the Parent Company is wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution of the Parent Company divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of the assets of the Parent Company and may, for such purpose, set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided.
The liquidator may also, with like sanction, vest the whole of any part of the Parent Companys assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the contributories as the liquidator shall think fit.
No shareholder shall be compelled to accept any shares or other securities or other assets that are subject to any liability.
On a return of capital on a winding up liquidation, preference shareholders are entitled, in priority to holders of ordinary shares of the Parent Company, to receive out of the surplus assets of the Parent Company any arrears and accruals of the dividend together with the greater of the price at which the gross yield on each preference share is equal to the mean gross yield on 3.5% War Loan or such Government Stock as may be agreed but not exceeding twice the nominal amount of the preference share and the nominal amount of the share together with any premium paid on issue.
The directors may make calls on shareholders in respect of monies unpaid on their shares.
If any call is not complied with the directors may serve a notice on such shareholder requiring him to pay the call together with any interest and expenses incurred by the Parent Company.
Failure to comply with a notice may result in forfeiture of any share which is the subject of the notice including any dividends declared and other monies payable in respect of the shares so forfeited.
The Parent Company has a first and paramount lien on every share that is not fully paid for all monies called or payable in respect of such share.
The Parent Company may sell any share on which the Parent Company has a lien passed following service of a notice on the shareholder demanding payment of the sum and giving notice of the Parent Companys intention to sell in default of such payment.
The Parent Company shall be entitled to sell any share of a shareholder if no cheque, warrant or order sent by the Parent Company in respect of the share in question has been cashed and no communication has been received by the Parent Company from the shareholder for a period of 12 years.
No shareholder is, unless the directors otherwise determine, entitled to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at any general meeting if: r Any call or any sum presently payable by him to the Parent Company in respect of such share remains unpaid or r The shareholder has failed to comply with a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and is in default for a period of 14 days from the date of service of such notice.
Further, if a shareholder who holds 0.25% or more in nominal value of the issued shares is in default of a section 793 notice then the directors may also withhold the payment of any dividend and restrict the transfer of shares held by such shareholder.
Save with the consent of preference shareholders, the directors shall not increase the amount of any shares of any class or any securities convertible into any shares of any class, ranking as regards participation in the profits or assets of the Parent Company otherwise than on a redemption or purchase by the Parent Company of any such share in priority to the preference shares.
The directors may refuse to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully paid up share provided that such refusal does not prevent dealing in the shares from taking place on an open and proper basis.
The directors may likewise refuse to register any transfer in favour of more than four persons jointly.
The directors may also refuse to register any transfer of any certificated share unless: r A duly stamped instrument of transfer is delivered to the Parent Companys registered office together with the certificates of the shares to which it relates and any other evidence that the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer and r The instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share.
The directors can require a shareholder to provide evidence that shares held by such shareholder are not held by or on behalf of a US Holder as defined in the Articles of Association.
The directors may require a US Holder to sell its shares to a non US resident, failing which the Parent Company may effect a sale of such shares.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer by a US Holder where it is made to a US resident.

Prior year development in 2008 showed favourable experience across all accident years and regions and totalled 369m, net of reinsurance.
The total discounting at the end of 2008 was 671m representing an increase of 70m in the year, due to the impact of foreign exchange.
In Scandinavia certain long tail liabilities are settled by an annuity and the discounted value of these annuities is shown separately.

A deferred tax asset of 16m 2007: 2m has been recognised in respect of losses included within other temporary differences at 31 December 2008.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 1,523m 2007: 1,237m tax losses and unused tax credits of 14m 2007: 33m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 68m 2007: 51m which will expire between 2009 and 2028.
Other tax losses and unused credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
The Group does not recognise deferred tax on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group is able to control the remittance of earnings to the UK and there is no intention to remit any such earnings to the UK in the foreseeable future if the remittance would trigger a material incremental UK tax liability.

The liabilities arising under the ADC contract comprise an insurance component and a deposit component.
The liability arising under the insurance component of 0.1bn represents the timing risk on the settlement of those liabilities.
The financial liability arising under the deposit component is offset by the value of funds held in a trust fund whose trust deed only permits the trust fund assets to be used to settle amounts due under the ADC.
The value of the funds held in trust at 31 December 2008 is 0.6bn and the value of the liability of the deposit component is 0.6bn.
The insurance component is accounted for within insurance liabilities and the deposit component, offset by the value of the funds held in the trust account, is recognised under other liabilities.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes, funded and unfunded defined benefit pension schemes, and has other post retirement obligations.
Defined contribution pension schemes Costs of 39m 2007: 34m were recognised in respect of defined contribution schemes by the Group.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries are part of a multi employer defined benefit scheme along with other financial institutions in Sweden.
As it is not possible to determine the assets and liabilities in respect of any one employer under this scheme, it is included in these accounts as a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions of 9m 2007: 23m were paid to this scheme during 2008 and are included in the costs shown above.
The latest information regarding the funding of this scheme is taken from the interim report for the first half of 2008, when the scheme funding rate was 119% 2007: 132%.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries share of the total multi employer scheme was less than 15% 2007: less than 15%.
Defined benefit pension schemes and other post retirement benefits The major defined benefit pension schemes are located in the UK.
The assets of these schemes are held mainly in separate trustee administered funds.
In April 2002, the primary UK defined benefit schemes were effectively closed to new entrants and in 2005, following discussions with the Trustees and consultation with the members, the UK defined benefit schemes were altered from providing benefits on a final salary basis to benefits on a revalued average salary basis with effect from 1 January 2006.
Under the new benefit formula, the accrued benefits of current active members are based on salaries at the date of change and will increase in line with inflation each year limited to 5% in any year up to their retirement date.
Benefits earned in each year from 1 January 2006 are based on salaries in that year and are revalued up to retirement.
In addition to these changes, the 2002 Scheme which was the scheme to which new UK employees had been admitted following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new members has been closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
It has been replaced by a stakeholder arrangement and members of the 2002 Scheme and future new employees in the UK accrue future benefits on a defined contribution basis under the stakeholder scheme.
For the two main UK defined benefit schemes, the level of contributions in 2008 were 23% and 22% of pensionable salaries 2007: 23% and 22%.
Additional contributions totalling 38m 2007: 86m were made to the schemes, in accordance with the plan to reduce their funding deficits.
Expected contributions to pension and post retirement benefit schemes for the year ending 31 December 2009 are approximately 71m, including a further 33m of additional contributions.
The major defined benefit schemes are subject to regular valuation using the projected unit method which is the basis used to determine the pension cost in the consolidated income statement.
Independent, qualified actuaries carry out valuations of the major defined benefit schemes for the purposes of assessing pension costs.

Retirement benefit obligations continued The Group also provides post retirement healthcare benefits to certain current and retired Canadian employees.
The benefits are not prefunded.
Life insurance benefits, which provide varying levels of coverage, are provided at no cost to retirees.
Healthcare benefits, which also provide varying levels of coverage, require retiree contributions in certain instances.

The expected return on schemes assets are determined for each asset class by considering both market conditions at the opening balance sheet date and any expectations for longer term changes in current returns.
All returns are net of investment expenses.
Mortality rate The mortality assumptions are set following investigations of the main schemes recent experience by the schemes actuaries for the funding valuations.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the main UK schemes used the PMA92 and PFA92 mortality tables for males and females respectively, with age ratings to reflect the schemes recent experience compared with that expected under these tables.
Reductions in future mortality rates are allowed for using the medium cohort projection and using the projected mortality rates applicable to calendar year 2014 for current pensioners and 2032 for future pensioners.
The weighted average assumptions imply that a current pensioner aged 60 has an expected future lifetime of 25.8 years males and 27.0 years females and a future pensioner aged 60 has a future lifetime of 27.2 years males and 28.2 years females.
Commutation Each of the UK defined benefit pension schemes has changed its rules to allow for increased commutation following A day in April 2006.
The commutation factors are broadly cost neutral i. e. when valued on the IAS 19 basis, the amount of cash taken is approximately equal to the value of the pension being given up.
For this reason there is no change made to previous practice whereby the accounting valuation makes no allowance for commutations.
Post retirement medical benefits The valuation of liabilities for post retirement liabilities in Canada assumes 7% decreasing to 5% in 2017 2007: 7% decreasing to 5% in 2017.
Sensitivity analysis The discount rate, the assumed inflation rate and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.
A 0.1% increase in the discount rate would reduce the defined benefit obligations in the UK by 68m.
A 0.1% increase in the inflation rate assumption would increase the defined benefit obligations in the UK by 59m.
An increase of one year in life expectancy would increase the defined benefit obligations by approximately 124m.

Share based compensation The Group has four types of share based payment plans which are settled in the form of ordinary shares: the Executive Share Option Scheme: the Sharesave Plan: the Share Matching Plan: and the Long Term Incentive Plan.
Dilution levels for all schemes are held strictly within Association of British Insurers limits.
The total employment cost recorded in the income statement for all plans was 25m in 2008 2007: 19m.
These costs include the costs associated with plans which are settled in the form of ordinary shares for awards that have been granted after 7 November 2002.
The value of equity settled awards granted prior to this date has been excluded in accordance with the transitional provisions contained in IFRS 2 Share Based Payment.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Group operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, which provides options to purchase ordinary shares to officers and other key employees at prices not less than the fair value of the ordinary shares at the date of grant.
The performance conditions in respect of awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme are described on page 59.
The exercise price of all options is the fair value of the ordinary shares on the date of grant.
All options expire 10 years after the date of the grant.
The value of the awards is charged in the income statement over the vesting period.
The weighted average share price on the dates the options were exercised in 2008 was 147.57p 2007: 152.06p.
Sharesave Plan Under the Groups Sharesave Plan savings related eligible employees can receive options to purchase ordinary shares at a price equal to 80% of the fair value of the ordinary shares on the date of grant.
All options vest either three or five years from the grant date and expire six months after vesting.
The number of shares available for purchase from the plan by each participant is limited to the whole number of shares purchasable from the aggregate value of the individuals savings contract upon maturity.
An individuals maximum monthly contribution to all current savings contracts is 250.

The fair value of share options granted under the Sharesave Plan during 2008 was 6m 2007: 8m.
The weighted average share price on the dates the options were exercised in 2008 was 147.21p 2007: 150.57p.
Fair values for the options granted under the Sharesave Plan were estimated as of the date of grant using the Black Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: dividend yields of 5.7% 2007: 4.0% : expected volatilities of 30% 2007: 30% : ordinary share price of 158.10p 2007: 142.90p risk free interest rates of 4.3% 2007: 5.0% : and expected terms equal to the vesting terms of 3.2 or 5.2 years.
An estimate based on past experience is made of the number of forfeitures during the vesting period due to employees leaving the Group.
The expected volatility is determined by reference to the actual volatility of the share price over the appropriate term ending on the grant date.
Share Matching Plan The Groups Share Matching Plan for executive directors and other selected executives was adopted following approval obtained at the 2004 AGM.
Awards were made during 2004 and 2005.
The performance conditions in respect of awards under the Share Matching Plan are described in the footnote to the long term incentive schemes table audited part on page 60.
Under the plan, Deferred Share awards granted are held in trust for three years and are normally forfeited upon an employee leaving the Group.
No further performance conditions apply.
Participants may also receive Matching Share awards up to a maximum of three times the number of Deferred Shares awarded.
Matching Share awards are subject to the achievement of total shareholder return targets over a single two year period, with performance measured by comparison against other UK listed companies.
Matching Share awards vest with the Deferred Share awards on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Further information on the Share Matching Plan may be found in the footnote to the long term incentive scheme table audited part on page 60.

Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and other selected executives was adopted following approval obtained at the 2006 AGM.
Awards have been made each year since 2006 following shareholder approval.
The structure of the plan allows for a number of different types of awards to be made.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are purchased by participants from net bonus payable limited to a maximum value of 33% of net bonus : in addition, for senior executives, the Remuneration Committee may defer a portion of an individuals bonus limited to 33% of that bonus into an award over shares referred to for the purpose of the plan as Compulsory Deferred Shares.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are held in trust for three years.
Compulsory Deferred Shares are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
The Remuneration Committee may make a conditional award of shares on a matched basis to Voluntary and Compulsory Deferred Shares Matching Shares up to a maximum of 2.5:1 and these are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee may make conditional awards of Performance Shares to senior executives and conditional awards of Restricted Shares to other executives and senior managers.
Awards of Performance Shares and Matching Shares related to Compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to a performance condition consisting of a combination of a return on equity target and a total shareholder return target with performance measured by comparison against other European insurance companies over a single three year performance period.
Matching Shares related to Voluntary Deferred Shares are subject only to the return on equity performance condition.
Restricted Shares are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Performance Shares and Restricted Shares are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.

Fair values of the awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan scheme during 2008 are taken to be the share price on the day preceding the grant date, except for the Restricted Shares where the share price is reduced by an estimate of the value of dividends that will not be received.
A dividend yield of 5.7% 2007: 4.0% was assumed.
Market related performance criteria were based on an arithmetic mean estimate of performance against a specified group of 13 competitors and it is assumed that all non market related performance criteria would be met such that all awards would be exercisable.
Other share based payments Certain employees of the Groups former US operation held entitlements under the Equity Incentive Scheme for US Employees prior to the disposal of the operation.
On disposal of the US operation the options under the scheme became cash settled and the majority of the options vested.
There are also other plans under which awards have been granted to certain employees in the form of cash settled share based awards.
Under these plans, if the vesting conditions are satisfied, cash awards are made based upon the underlying performance of the Parent Companys ordinary shares.
Awards were made in 1999 and 2001 under old schemes and during 2004 and 2005 on terms that provide the same potential benefits as the Share Matching Plan.
The liability in respect of these plans at 31 December 2008 was 1m 2007: 4m.
The intrinsic value of awards that had vested at 31 December 2008 was 1m 2007: 4m.
