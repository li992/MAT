This category includes listed equity shares, certain exchange-traded derivatives, G10 government securities and certain US agency securities.
2 Valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data.
Instruments in this category are valued using: a quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active: or b valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
The type of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active, but are based on quoted market prices, broker dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency and those instruments valued using techniques include most government agency securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, certain mortgage products, certain bank and bridge loans, repos and reverse repos, less liquid listed equities, state and municipal obligations, most physical commodities, investment contracts issued by the Groups life assurance businesses and certain money market securities and loan commitments and most OTC derivatives.
3 Instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used.
Otherwise, the Group determines a reasonable level for the input.
Financial instruments included within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy primarily consist of cash instruments which trade infrequently, certain syndicated and commercial mortgage loans, unlisted equity shares, certain residual interests in securitisations, super senior tranches of high grade and mezzanine collateralised debt obligations CDOs, and other mortgage-based products and less liquid debt securities, certain structured debt securities in issue and OTC derivatives where valuation depends upon unobservable inputs such as certain credit and exotic derivatives.
No gain or loss is recognised on the initial recognition of a financial instrument valued using a technique incorporating significant unobservable data.
4 Other financial liabilities comprise subordinated liabilities and write downs relating to undrawn syndicated loan facilities.

Fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value The following table shows the carrying values and the fair values of financial instruments carried on the balance sheets at amortised cost.
2 Fair values are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows: using current interest rates and making adjustments for credit.
3 The fair value of deposits repayable on demand is equal to their carrying value.
The fair value of other deposits by banks and customer accounts is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at current rates and adjusting, where appropriate, for the Groups own credit spread.
The fair value of many of these instruments approximates to their carrying value because they are of short maturity or reprice frequently.
4 The fair value of short-term debt securities in issue is close to their carrying value.
The fair value of other debt securities in issue is based on quoted prices: where these are unavailable fair value is estimated using other valuation techniques.
