The historic volatility is calculated using a weekly rolling share price for the three year period immediately prior to the option grant date.
Share options are granted under a service condition and, for grants to senior employees, a non-market performance condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the services received.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.
