Directors Remuneration Report Continued Executive Directors Remuneration Reporting Principles The Committee has decided to continue with the principle of reporting awards made in respect of the reporting year even though these may not be received until the following year or later.
Base Salary Based on the results of a salary benchmarking study undertaken by MM & K, increases ranging from 0% to 8.7% were recommended by the Remuneration Committee in March 2009.
Executive Directors salaries are set at or about the market median level in line with the stated policy.
Mike Wagstaff waived his proposed salary increase for 2009.
Base salaries from 1 April 2009 will be as follows: Mike Wagstaff Chief Executive 400,000 Jon Murphy Chief Operating Officer 250,000 Peter Turner Finance Director 250,000 Rod Begbie Corporate Development Director 232,000 None of the Executive Directors holds any other directorships in listed companies.
However, the Committee has determined that an Executive Director may receive any fees for acting as a director of another company, subject to Board approval.

In assessing individual performance, the Committee also took a subjective view of the way management dealt with difficult operational issues which arose during the year.
Annual bonus awards for Executive Directors are payable in shares, receipt of which is deferred for two years subject to continued employment, unless an election is made to receive cash.
The maximum annual bonus award for an Executive Director payable only in return for exceptional performance is 150% of base salary if the award is received in shares or 100% of base salary, if the award is taken as cash.
