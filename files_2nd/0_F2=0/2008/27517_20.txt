Segmental information The Groups operating segments are organised into similar product and service types.
The Board is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
This is due to the Board being the ultimate decision maker for future resource allocation to the Groups underwriting platforms.
Monthly management information is reported to the Board on a segmental basis to aid its assessment of the Groups performance.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise insurance working capital, central items and the deferred tax asset.
The Group comprises the following reportable operating segments: i Specialty Business included within the Specialty segment relates to financial institutions, professional indemnity, management liability, ne art & specie, special situations, bloodstock and credit, political risk & terrorism.

The terms and conditions of the grants, and number of outstanding awards granted to directors and employees of the Group, are as follows amended to re ect the 1-for-10 share consolidation, see note 26 : Grant date Outstanding instruments Vesting conditions Contractual life of obligations Share options 6 October 2000 24,467 Three years service 10 years LTIP shares 16 January 2006 1,527,580 See note 12 d 3 years 8 January 2007 1,117,545 See note 12 d 3 years 14 May 2007 334,877 Vesting is dependent upon Novaes TSR between 1 January 2007 and 3 years 31 December 2009 relative to its peer group.
No shares will vest unless Novae is ranked at or above the 50th percentile in terms of relative TSR.
Full vesting will occur at the 25th percentile with vesting pro rating between those points.
14 March 2008 1,545,000 Vesting of one half of each award is dependent upon Novaes TSR between 3 years 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2010 relative to its peer group.
Vesting of the other half of each award is dependent on the achievement of net tangible assets NTA growth targets between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2010.
No shares will vest unless the Groups NTA growth over the period is equivalent to at least 10% pre tax returns on opening equity, at which point 0% would vest, rising to full vesting for NTA growth equivalent to 15% pre tax returns on opening equity.
All awards are settled by physical delivery of shares.
The options are exercisable between three and ten years after grant, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance targets.
Novae Group plc | Annual Report 2008 Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 93 The number and weighted average exercise price of share options are as follows amended to re ect the 1-for-10 share consolidation, see note 26 : Weighted Weighted average exercise Number of average exercise Number of price 2008 options 2008 price 2007 options 2007 thousands thousands Outstanding at the beginning of the year 11.88 100 5.68 1,090 Lapsed forfeited during the year 12.12 76 5.06 990 Outstanding at the end of the year 11.14 24 11.88 100 Exercisable at the end of the year 11.14 24 11.88 100 The options outstanding at 31 December 2008 have an exercise price of 11.14 and a remaining contractual life of two years.
The fair value of services received in return for share based awards granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share options and LTIP shares granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a binomial lattice model.
The contractual life is used as an input into this model.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the binomial lattice model.
The assumptions with regard to the LTIP charge are as follows amended to re ect the 1-for-10 share consolidation, see note 26 : Fair value Issue price 16 January 2006 3.00 3.00 8 January 2007 3.45 3.45 14 May 2007 1.63 4.15 14 March 2008 1.66 3.48 The 16 January 2006 grant vests based upon progressive NTA targets.
Applying consistent assumptions produces a fair value equal to the then prevailing share price of 3.00.
The 8 January 2007 grant is structured similarly to the 2006 award, so again a fair value equal to the prevailing share price on the issue date of 3.45 has been adopted.
The 14 May 2007 grant is dependent upon share price performance relative to peer companies.
The fair value has been determined using a Monte Carlo simulation on the assumption that all companies are valued on a consistent basis.
One half of each award granted on 14 March 2008 is dependent upon share price performance relative to peer companies, in the same way as the May 2007 award.
The fair value of 1.36 has been determined using a Monte Carlo simulation on the assumption that all companies are valued on a consistent basis.
The other half of each award is structured similarly to the 2006 award.
Based on the outlook for 2008-2010 it is estimated that partial vesting is the most likely outcome: consistent with this a fair value of 1.95 has been adopted.
The aggregate fair value of 1.66 represents the average of that for the two components.
d 2005 LTIP vesting conditions The 2005 LTIP was approved by shareholders on 12 January 2006.
Under the 2005 LTIP awards were made in January 2006 Initial Awards and January 2007 Second Year Awards.
80 employees of the Group including executive directors hold awards under the 2005 LTIP.
In accordance with its terms, no further awards may be made under the 2005 LTIP.
Vesting occurs if net tangible assets per share meet performance targets by 31 December 2008 Initial Awards and 31 December 2009 Second Year Awards.
Under the terms of the 2005 LTIP progress towards vesting must be reported in each annual and interim report.
Both awards are split into two components: Part A, worth three quarters of the total, relates only to the performance of the ongoing business removing the effects of 2002 and prior years of account and Part B, worth one quarter of the total, relates to the overall outcome, including effects stemming from prior years.
Each part of the award operates separately and there is no inter-conditionality.
Awards vest as soon as performance targets are met but shares will generally only be released on the third anniversary of the relevant award.

Employees continued Net tangible assets per share amended to re ect the 1-for-10 share consolidation, see note 26 required for full vesting of Initial Awards are 3.49: and 3.88 for Second Year Awards, in both cases adjusted to include dividends paid during the relevant period.
At 31 December 2008 reported net tangible assets per share adjusted to include dividends paid were 420.8p: as a result all awards under the 2005 LTIP have met their vesting conditions.
The awards will be released on their third anniversaries.
Dividends per share Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 m m Interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 2.5p per share 1.8 Final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2007 of 7.5p per share amended to refl ect the 1-for-10 share consolidation, see note 26 5.4 7.2 A final dividend of 7.5p per ordinary share and a special dividend of 4.0p per ordinary share are payable on 7 May 2009 to shareholders registered on 14 April 2009.
These financial statements do not provide for these dividends as a liability.
Earnings, net assets and net tangible assets per share Basic earnings per share The calculation of earnings per share of 51.7p 2007: 45.3p is based on a pro t attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company of 37.1 million 2007: 32.7 million and on 71.7 million shares 2007: 72.2 million shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue excluding shares held by the Employee Bene t Trust which are earmarked for the Groups LTIP and deferred bonuses payable in shares during the year ended 31 December 2008.
These gures re ect the 1-for-10 share consolidation see note 26.
In the absence of the share consolidation, the earnings per share would have been 5.2p 2007: 4.5p.
Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share are calculated adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive shares.
Novae Group has two sources of potentially dilutive shares: share options and LTIP awards deferred bonuses payable in shares.
For share options, a calculation is made to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
For LTIP awards and deferred bonuses payable in shares, the number of potential shares is calculated with reference to the current date as though it were the vesting date, excluding shares held by the Employee Bene t Trust earmarked for these awards.
For the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007, the share options are not considered to have any dilutive effect as the average market price of ordinary shares during these years did not exceed the exercise price.

Financial liabilities a Convertible debt Novae Holdings Limited formerly Novae Holdings PLC issued 500,000 7% 100 convertible bonds at a nominal value of 50.0 million on 15 December 2003.
On 18 May 2006, the liability due on these bonds was transferred to Novae Group plc.
On 7 November 2007 Novae Group plc announced its intention to acquire the convertible bonds for cancellation.
As at 31 December 2007 39.4 million had been bought at par value plus accrued interest and cancelled.
During 2008 a further 6.6 million was bought at par value plus accrued interest and cancelled prior to the maturity date.
The remaining 4.0 million matured on 15 December 2008.
The bonds could have been converted into shares at the holders option at the rate of one ordinary share per 556.6p nominal value of convertible debt at any time until 9 December 2008.
The fair value of the liability component and the equity conversion component were determined at issuance of the bond.
The fair value of the liability component was calculated using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond net of issue costs of 2.1 million.
The residual amount, representing the value of the equity conversion component, was included in shareholders equity.
On maturity the remaining equity component was transferred to the pro t and loss account see note 26.
The liability was measured using the effective interest rate basis: this gave rise to the charge of 0.8 million shown in note 8. www.
