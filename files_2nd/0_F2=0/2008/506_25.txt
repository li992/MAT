Notes to the Group Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2008 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations collectively IFRSs endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act, 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modi ed by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value.
As at 31 December 2008 the Group had net current liabilities of 98.1 million mainly as a result of borrowings less than one year of 167.7 million.
Since the year end the Group has re nanced or replaced 158.9 million of facilities due to mature in September 2009 with new facilities totalling 195.0 million.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
New standards and interpretations not applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards, amendments and interpretations with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and therefore after the date of these financial statements: Effective date IFRS 3 Revised Business combinations 1 July 2009 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 IAS 1 Revised Presentation of financial statements 1 January 2009 IAS 23 Revised Borrowing costs 1 January 2009 IAS 27 Revised Consolidated and separate financial statements 1 July 2009 Amendment to IFRS 1 First time adoption of IFRS and IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements 1 January 2009 Amendment to IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements 1 January 2009 Amendment to IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement 1 July 2009 Amendment to IFRS 2 Share based payment vesting conditions and cancellations 1 January 2009 IFRIC 15 Agreement for construction of real estates 1 January 2009 Upon adoption of IFRS 8, the Group will need to expand the disclosure in relation to segmental analysis.
The adoption of this standard is not expected to impact the Groups pro t or net assets.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of the other above standards or interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Aggreko plc and all its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has the power to govern financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding that confers more than half of the voting rights.
The consolidated income statement included the results of business purchased from the effective date of acquisition.
Revenue recognition Revenue for the Group represents the amounts earned from the supply of temporary power, temperature control, oil-free compressed air and related services and excludes sales taxes and intra-group revenue.
Revenue is recognised during the rental period in which the equipment and related services are utilised by the customer.
74 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Segmental reporting Aggrekos primary reporting format relates to geographical segments comprising Northern Europe, Continental Europe, North America, Middle East, Asia-Paci c and South America together the Groups Local business and a global segment of International Power Projects IPP.
IPP is managed as a single segment, with the deployment of assets varying from year to year depending on the location of projects.
The geographical risks and rewards within IPP are signi cantly different from those within the Groups Local business.
Aggrekos secondary reporting format relates to the Groups two business types detailed above, namely the Local business and International Power Projects business.
The Local business focuses on smaller, more frequently occurring events, whereas the International Power Projects business concentrates on large contracts, which can arise anywhere in the world.
The risks and rewards of the Groups operations are determined by the different geographical locations.
This is re ected by the Groups divisional management and organisational structure and the Groups internal financial reporting systems.
The segmental analysis in Note 4 to the Accounts is based on location of assets.
Central administrative costs are allocated between segments based on revenue.
Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group are classi ed as operating leases.
Rentals under operating leases are charged against operating pro t on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Exceptional items Items are classi ed as exceptional gains or losses where they are considered by the Group to be material and are different from events or transactions which fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and which individually, or if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to be properly understood.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes purchase price, and directly attributable costs of bringing the asset into the location and condition where it is capable for use.
Borrowing costs are not capitalised.
Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over 25 years.
Short leasehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over the terms of each lease.
Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of each asset over its useful life from the date it is available for use.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
The periods of depreciation are reviewed on an annual basis and the principal periods used are as follows: Rental eet 8 to 10 years Vehicles, plant and equipment 4 to 15 years Capital grants Capital grants in respect of additions to property, plant and equipment are netted against the cost of the related asset and this cost is depreciated in accordance with the policy above.
Intangibles Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition of each asset over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships: 10 years: Non-compete agreements: over the life of the non-compete agreements.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the speci c software.
These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is currently deemed to be 4 years.
The useful life of intangible assets is reviewed on an annual basis.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 75 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2008 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to impairment reviews, both annually and when there are indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
For the purpose of the impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to bene t from the synergies of the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Any impairment of goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets excluding goodwill Property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets are amortised depreciated and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is calculated using estimated cash ows.
These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre-tax interest rate.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identi able cash ows cash-generating units.
Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements for each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates functional currency.
The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency.
At individual company level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets are translated at the historical rate.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Income and cash ow statements are translated at average rates of exchange for the period.
Gains and losses from the settlement of transactions and gains and losses on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments The activities of the Group expose it directly to the financial risks of changes in forward foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recorded and subsequently measured at fair value, which is calculated using standard industry valuation techniques in conjunction with observable market data.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash ows using market interest rates and the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the reporting date.
The treatment of changes in fair value of derivatives depends on the derivative classi cation.
The Group designates derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions or commitments cash ow hedge.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
76 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Cash ow hedge Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated, and effective, as hedges of future cash ows are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in finance costs in the income statement.
If the cash ow hedge of a rm commitment or forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in finance costs in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net pro t and loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in finance costs in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer quali es for hedge accounting.
At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to finance costs in the income statement.
Overseas net investment hedges Certain foreign currency borrowings are designated as hedges of the Groups overseas net investments, which are denominated in the functional currency of the reporting operation.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings are taken to equity on consolidation to the extent the hedges are deemed effective.
All other exchange gains and losses are dealt with through other income in the income statement.
Taxation Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, negative goodwill nor from the acquisition of an asset, which does not affect either taxable or accounting income.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provision for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally relating to subsidiaries, is only made where there is a current intention to remit such earnings.
Current tax The charge for the current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, using the FIFO or weighted average cost basis.
Cost includes the cost of direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Inventory is written down on a case by case basis if the anticipated net realisable value declines below the carrying amount of the inventories.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
When the reasons for a write-down of the inventory have ceased to exist, the write-down is reversed.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 77 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2008 1 Accounting policies continued Employee bene ts Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary bene ts are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
Where the Group provides long-term employee bene ts, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.
The Group operates a fide ned bene t pension scheme and a number of fide ned contribution pensions schemes.
The cost for the year for the fide ned bene t scheme is determined using the projected unit method with a control period equal to the expected future working lifetime of active members with actuarial updates to the valuation being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full, directly in retained earnings, in the period in which they occur and are shown in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The current service cost of the pension charge as well as the expected return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities are included in arriving at operating pro t. The retirement bene t obligation recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The present value of the fide ned bene t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash ows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds.
Contributions to fide ned contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they become chargeable.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
An allowance is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
Signi cant financial dif culties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or large and old outstanding balances are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Provisions Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an out ow of resources that can be reasonably estimated.
Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account the time value of money where material.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be con rmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an in ow of economic bene ts is probable.
Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions of the standard.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the Groups various employee-share and option schemes.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for employee sharesave options and using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model for Executive share options.
Own shares held under trust for the Groups employee share schemes are classed as Treasury shares and deducted in arriving at shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised on disposal of Treasury shares.
Purchases of own shares are disclosed as changes in shareholders equity.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
This fide nition is also used for the cash ow statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate.
78 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Key assumptions and signi cant judgements The Group uses estimates and makes judgements in the preparation of its Accounts.
The most sensitive areas affecting the Accounts are discussed below.
Property, plant and equipment The property, plant and equipment used in the business is mainly the rental eet which has a depreciation life typically of between 8 and 10 years.
The annual depreciation charge relates to the estimated service lives allocated to each type of asset.
Assets lives are reviewed regularly and changed if necessary to re ect current thinking on their remaining lives in light of technological change, prospective economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets.
Intangible assets In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations goodwill arising on acquisition of assets and subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible assets.
IFRS 3 also requires the identi cation of other acquired intangible assets.
The techniques used to value these intangible assets are in line with internationally used models but do require the use of estimates and forecasts which may differ from actual outcomes.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation period adopted for these items and, potentially, by any differences between forecast and actual outcomes related to individual intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
The impairment review calculations require the use of forecasts related to the future pro tability and cash generating ability of the acquired assets.
Pensions Pension arrangements vary for our employees and schemes re ect best practice and regulation in each country.
The Group operates a fide ned bene t scheme for UK employees, which was closed to new employees joining the Group after 1 April 2002: most of the other schemes in operation around the world are varieties of fide ned contribution schemes.
Under IAS 19: Employee Bene ts Aggreko has recognised a pre-tax pension fide cit of 8.0 million at 31 December 2008 2007: 8.1 million with the lower than expected returns on Scheme assets offset by additional contributions made by the Company during the year of 4.0 million in line with the Recovery Plan for the Scheme agreed after the actuarial valuation at 31 December 2005.
The main assumptions used in IAS 19 valuation for the previous two years are shown in Note 27 of the Accounts.
Taxation The Groups tax charge is based on the pro t for the year and tax rates in force at the balance sheet date.
Estimation of the tax charge requires an assessment to be made of the potential tax treatment of certain items which will only be resolved once nally agreed with the relevant tax authorities.
Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include liquidity, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk.
The Group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to meet the Groups funding requirements as they arise, and that financial risk arising from the Groups underlying operations is effectively identi ed and managed.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 79 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2008 1 Accounting policies continued The treasury operations are conducted in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and are reviewed annually.
Financial instruments are only executed for hedging purposes and transactions that are speculative in nature are expressly forbidden.
Monthly reports are provided to senior management and treasury operations are subject to periodic internal and external review.
Liquidity, funding and capital management The Groups objective with respect to managing capital is to maintain a balance sheet structure that is both ef cient in terms of providing long term returns to shareholders and safeguards the Groups financial position through economic cycles.
If appropriate the Group can choose to adjust its capital structure by varying the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, returning of capital to shareholders, by issuing new shares or by adjusting the level of capital expenditure.
The Group maintains suf cient facilities to meet its normal funding requirements over the medium-term.
These facilities are primarily in the form of committed bank facilities totalling 510.4 million at 31 December 2008, arranged on a bilateral basis with a number of international banks.
The financial covenants attached to these facilities are that operating pro t should be no less than 3 times interest and net debt should be no more than 3 times EBITDA.
The Group does not consider that these financial covenants are restrictive to its operations.
Since the year end the Group has re nanced or replaced 158.9 million of facilities that mature in September 2009 with new facilities totalling 195.0 million.
The maturity pro le of the borrowings is detailed in Note 17 in the Financial Statements with the next maturity not due until 2011.
The facilities now in place are currently anticipated to be adequate for meeting the Groups requirements for the foreseeable future.
Net debt amounted to 364.0 million at 31 December 2008 and at that date undrawn committed facilities were 141.1 million.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to minimise the exposure to interest rates by ensuring an appropriate balance of xed and oating rates.
The Groups primary funding is at oating rates through its bank facilities.
In order to manage the associated interest rate risk, the Group uses interest rate swaps to vary the mix of xed and oating rates.
At 31 December 2008, 227.5 million of the net debt of 364.0 million was at xed rates of interest resulting in a xed to oating rate net debt ratio of 63:37.
The Group monitors its interest rate exposure on a regular basis by applying forecast interest rates to the Groups forecast net debt pro le after taking into account its existing hedges.
The Group also calculates the impact on pro t and loss of a fide ned interest rate shift for all currencies.
Based on the simulations performed, the impact on pro t or loss of a -100 basis-point shift, after taking into account existing hedges, would be 1.5 million 2007: 0.8 million.
The sensitivity analysis is performed on a monthly basis and is reported to the Board.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is subject to currency exposure on the translation of its net investments in overseas subsidiaries into sterling.
In order to reduce the currency risk arising, the Group uses direct borrowings in the same currency as those investments.
Group borrowings are currently drawn down in the principal currencies affecting the Group, namely US dollar, euro, sterling and Canadian dollar.
The Group manages its currency ows to minimise foreign exchange risk arising on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and uses forward contracts where appropriate in order to hedge net currency ows.
The positive impact of currency, largely due to the movement in the US dollar and the euro, increased our revenues by 57.1 million 2007: decrease of 27.7 million and trading pro t by 12.8 million 2007: decrease of 5.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Group monitors the impact of exchange closely and regularly carries out sensitivity analysis.
For every 5 cents movement in the US dollar to GBP exchange rate 1 there is an approximate impact of 4.4 million 2007: 2.7 million in trading pro t in terms of translation.
For every 5 cents movement in the euro to GBP exchange rate there is an approximate impact of 0.5 million 2007: 0.4 million in trading pro t in terms of translation.
Currency translation also gave rise to a 99.0 million increase in reserves as a result of year on year movements in the exchange rates 2007: increase of 5.6 million.
For every 5 cents movement in the dollar and euro, there is an approximate impact in equity of 9.2 million and 2.8 million respectively 2007: 3.7 million and 1.4 million, arising from the currency translation of external borrowings which are being used as a net investment hedge.
1 Trading pro t represents operating pro t before gain on sale of property, plant and equipment.
80 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Credit risk Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties.
The Group manages this risk by limiting the aggregate amounts and their duration depending on external credit ratings of the relevant counterparty.
In the case of financial assets exposed to credit risk, the carrying amount in the balance sheet, net of any applicable provisions for loss, represents the amount exposed to credit risk.
Management of trade receivables The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and signi cant outstanding debts.
At an operating unit level a credit rating is normally established for each customer based on ratings from external agencies.
Where no ratings are available, cash in advance payment terms are often established for new customers.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis.
Some of the contracts undertaken in our IPP business are substantial, and are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk pro le and debtor-position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments, bank guarantees and various types of insurance.
On the largest contracts, all such arrangements are approved at Group level.
Contracts are reviewed on a case by case basis to determine the customer and country risk.
Insurance The Group operates a policy of buying cover where possible for material risks from the global insurance market, while self-insuring risks which would not have a material impact on the Group as a whole.
The Group monitors its insurance arrangements in such a way to ensure the quality and extent of cover.

It will be paid on 15 May 2009 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 17 April 2009.

These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those relating to expected changes in revenue and the cost base, discount rates and long-term growth rates.
The discount rate used for business valuations was 8.5% after tax, 11.6% before tax based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
On the basis that the business carried out by all CGUs is closely related and assets can be redeployed around the Group as required, a consistent Group discount rate has been used for all CGUs.
Values in use were determined using current year cash ows, a prudent view of future market trends and excludes any growth capital expenditure.
A terminal cash ow was calculated using a long-term growth rate of 2.0%.
As at 31 December 2008, based on internal valuations, Aggreko plc management concluded that the values in use of the CGUs signi cantly exceeded their net asset value.
The Directors consider that there is no reasonably probable change in the key assumptions made in their impairment calculations that would give rise to an impairment.

The Group assesses credit quality differently in relation to its two business models.
Local business Our Local business serves customers in Northern Europe, Continental Europe, North America, Middle East, Asia-Paci c and South America.
It focuses on the smaller, more frequently occurring events and the majority of the contracts in this business are small relative to the size of the Group.
There is no concentration of credit risk in this business as there are a large number of customers who are unrelated and internationally dispersed.
The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and signi cant outstanding debts.
The effectiveness of this credit process has meant that the Group has historically had a low level of bad debt in the Local business.
90 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Accounts 16 Trade and other receivables continued International Power Projects IPP Our International Power Projects business concentrates on medium to very large contracts.
Most projects in this business are worth over 1 million and some can be worth over 10 million.
Customers are mainly in developing countries and include power utilities, governments, armed forces, oil companies and mining companies.
In addition the majority of the contracts above are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk pro le and debtor position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments, guarantees and various types of insurance.
On the largest contracts, all such arrangements are approved at a Group level.
To date the Group has also had a low level of bad debt in the IPP business.
The total trade receivables balance as at 31 December 2008 for our IPP business was 93.8 million 2007: 36.6 million.
Within this balance receivable balances totalling 66.3 million 2007: 26.9 million had some form of payment cover attached to them.
The risk associated with the remaining 27.5 million 2007: 9.7 million is deemed to be either acceptable or payment cover is not obtainable in a cost effective manner.

The principal benchmark rates for oating rate financial liabilities are the relevant LIBOR London Interbank Offered Rate rates for sterling, US dollars and euro and liabilities are normally xed in advance for periods between one and three months.
The weighted average interest rate on xed debt is derived from the xed leg of each interest rate swap.
The effect of the Groups interest rate swaps is to classify 227.5 million 2007: 150.9 million of borrowings in the above table as xed rate.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2008 was 227.5 million 2007: 150.9 million.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Market values have been used to determine fair values.

Current borrowings and overdrafts Short-term deposits The fair value of short-term deposits and current borrowings and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Non-current borrowings In the case of bank loans and other loans, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are oating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings Per Share as disclosed in the consolidated income statement.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a speci ed period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
Retesting of performance conditions is limited to six monthly intervals between 3 and 5 years after the date of grant.
For Executive Share Options granted prior to 25 April 2001, at the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option, the Companys TSR since the date of grant of the option is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys annual EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
There is no legal obligation upon the Company to satisfy the options existing under the Savings-Related and Executive Share Option Schemes other than by the allotment of new issue shares.
It is intended to satisfy awards to US participants in the Long-term Incentive Plan by the allotment of new shares.
The maximum award would be made on achieving the performance targets set out on pages 55 to 56 of the Remuneration Report.
Aggreko has taken the IFRS 1 exemption to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment only to options that were granted after 7 November 2002 and were not vested at 1 January 2005.
For the Sharesave and US Stock Options the Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used.
As the Executive options have share price based performance conditions attached the Monte Carlo option-pricing model was used.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.

The pension cost attributable to overseas employees for 2008 was 3.1 million 2007: 2.5 million.
United Kingdom The Group operates pension schemes for UK employees.
The Aggreko plc Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded, contributory, fide ned bene t scheme.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group under the control of the Directors of Aggreko Pension Scheme Trustee Limited.
The Scheme is subject to valuations at intervals of not more than three years by independent actuaries.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2005 using the Attained Age method to determine the level of contributions to be made by the Group.
The actuaries adopted a valuation basis linked to market conditions at the valuation date.
Assets were taken at market value.
The major actuarial assumptions used were: Return on investments 4.6% Growth in average pay levels 4.3% Increase in pensions 2.8% At the valuation date, the market value of the Schemes assets excluding AVCs was 18,400,000 which was suf cient to cover 53% of the bene ts that had accrued to members, after making allowances for future increases in earnings.
Following completion of the valuation at 31 December 2005, the Company and the trustees agreed upon a Schedule of Contributions and a Recovery Plan.
During 2006 the Company contributions for bene ts building up in the future were increased to 31.5% of pensionable earnings and from 1 January 2007 the Company contribution was 25.4% of pensionable earnings.
From 1 January 2007 future bene ts are accrued on a Career Average basis hence the change to the required contribution rate.
To address the Scheme fide cit the Company made additional contributions of 3.5 million in 2006 and 4.0 million in 2007 and 2008 and the Company plans to make further additional contributions of 0.5 million per annum until the year ended 31 December 2015.
Employee contributions increased from 5% to 6% of pensionable earnings from 1 January 2007.
The Scheme will undergo a formal valuation at 31 December 2008.
This valuation is expected to be completed during 2009 and following completion, the Company contributions to the Scheme may change.
The Scheme was closed to all new employees joining the Group after 1 April 2002.
For new employees joining after 1 April 2002, a fide ned contribution scheme has been introduced.
Contributions of 0.6 million were paid to this scheme during the year 2007: 0.4 million.
There are no outstanding or prepaid balances at the year end.
An update of the Scheme was carried out by a quali ed independent actuary using the latest available information for the purposes of this statement.
The major assumptions used in this update by the actuary were: 31 Dec 2008 31 Dec 2007 Rate of increase in salaries 4.5% 4.9% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0% 3.4% Discount rate 5.4% 5.5% In ation assumption 3.0% 3.4% Expected return on Scheme assets 5.6% 6.0% Longevity at age 65 for current pensioners years Men 22.8 22.8 Women 26.0 26.0 Longevity at age 65 for future pensioners years Men 24.9 24.9 Women 27.9 27.9 The expected return on Scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the bene t obligation.
