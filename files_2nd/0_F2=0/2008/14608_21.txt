The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2008 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The consolidated and parent Company financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 27 May 2008.
Statement of compliance Both the Group and parent Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS.
On publishing the parent Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part of the approved financial statements.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: disclosure was adopted during the year.
As the standard is concerned only with disclosure, its adoption had no impact on either the Balance Sheet or Income Statement.
IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share transactions was adopted during the year.
The standard requires the Group to account for its existing share-based payment arrangements as equity-settled transactions in both the Group and Subsidiary financial statements.
This was the treatment adopted by the Group and subsidiaries in prior years and accordingly IFRIC 11 has no impact on the Balance Sheet or Income Statement.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are held at fair value.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra-Group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting standards not yet effective These consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and related IFRIC interpretations in issue that have been endorsed by the European Union and are effective as at 31 March 2008.
The International Accounting Standards Board IASB has introduced a number of accounting standards which have been adopted by the European Union, and are available for early adoption.
However, the Group has not applied these in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008.
The relevant standards and interpretations that will impact the Group are as follows: IFRS 8 Operating Segments is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
The Group has decided not to adopt the standard in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007.
The application of IFRS 7 in 2007 would not have affected the balance sheet or income statement as the standard is concerned only with disclosure.
The Group and parent Company plan to adopt it in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the hire.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Transfers of risks and rewards are consistent across all hire contracts.
Transfer occurs when the product is received at the customers location.
Depreciation Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is charged to the income statement so as to write off the cost of the assets over the estimated useful lives after taking account of estimated residual values.
Residual values are reassessed annually.
Hire equipment assets are depreciated so as to write them down to their residual value over their normal working lives which range from three to fifteen years depending on the category of the asset.
Losses and disposals of such assets are accounted for on a FIFO basis.
68 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 15110 04 06 2008 Proof 5 15110  13 6 08 10:33 Page 69 The principal rates and methods of depreciation used are as follows: Hire equipment Tools and general equipment between three and seven years straight-line Surveying equipment five years straight-line Power equipment between five and ten years straight-line Accommodation and storage units between eight and fifteen years straight-line Non-hire assets Freehold buildings, and long leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease period and 50 years straight-line Short leasehold property improvements over the period of the lease Fixtures and fittings and office equipment excluding IT 25%45% per annum reducing balance IT equipment and software between three and five years straight-line, or over the period of software licence if shorter Motor vehicles 25% per annum reducing balance Start-up expenses and lease incentives Legal and start-up expenses incurred in respect of new hire depots are written off as incurred.
Premiums paid or incentives received including rent-free periods extending beyond a depots opening date on the acquisition of trading locations are written off over the period of the lease.
Leases Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
These assets are included in the balance sheet at the lower of the fair value or present value of minimum lease payments at inception and are depreciated accordingly.
The capital element of the corresponding financing commitments is included in the Balance Sheet.
Lease payments in respect of finance leases are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Financing income and costs Financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, and gains and losses on financial instruments that are recognised in the Income Statement see below.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest rate.
Interest payable on borrowings includes a charge in respect of attributable transaction costs, which are recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the leases implicit interest rate.
Income tax Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities affecting neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 69 15110 04 06 2008 Proof 5  13 6 08 10:33 Page 70 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2008 Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing products or services business segment or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
The Group primarily analyses its activities based on class of business.
Its operational activities are undertaken within the UK and Republic of Ireland, and accordingly the Groups operating activities are derived from only one geographical segment.
Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and an appropriate proportion of directly attributable overheads.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful economic lives, those components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Intangible assets As part of its transition to IFRS, the Group elected to restate only those business combinations that occurred on or after 1 April 2004.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework, UK GAAP.
Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
In respect of acquisitions since 1 April 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, and is included as an intangible asset.
It is allocated to cashgenerating units and is tested annually for impairment.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses see note 11.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of identified intangible assets.
Intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortised from the date that they are available for use.
For a number of its acquisitions, the Group has identified intangible assets in respect of sole supply contracts, customer lists, brands and non-compete agreements.
The values of these intangibles are recognised as part of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
The useful lives are estimated as follows: Sole supply contracts over the unexpired period of the contracts, up to five years Customer lists ten years Brand over the period of use in the business, up to four years Non-compete agreements over the period of the agreement Impairments The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventory and deferred tax, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows of the identified cash-generating units are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that are largely independent from the other assets and groups.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit or group of units on a pro rata basis.
70 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 15110 04 06 2008 Proof 5 15110  13 6 08 10:33 Page 71 An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Own shares held by ESOP trust Transactions of the Company-sponsored ESOP trust are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the parent Company and Group financial statements.
In particular, the Trusts purchase of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where appropriate, overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from financing activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes: however, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments and the movement in fair value is recognised in the Income Statement.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value: attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised directly in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires, no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, is sold, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast transaction occurs.
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised.
In other cases the amount recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged items affects profit or loss.
Intra-Group financial instruments Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount less impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and overnight deposits.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Translation of foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses arising on settlement or retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are included in the income statement.
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange during the period.
Exchange differences resulting from the translation of the results and balances of overseas subsidiary undertakings are charged or credited directly to the Foreign Currency translation reserve.
Such translation differences become recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which the subsidiary undertaking is disposed.
Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 71 15110 04 06 2008 Proof 5  13 6 08 10:33 Page 72 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2008 Employee benefits Pension schemes The Group offers a stakeholder pension arrangement to employees and in addition makes contributions to personal pension schemes for certain employees.
Obligations for contributions to these defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred.
Share-based payment transactions The Group operates a number of schemes which allow certain employees to acquire shares in the Company, including the Performance Plan, the Co-investment Plan, and the All Employee Share Scheme.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured, using an appropriate option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to total shareholder return not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the obligation can be measured reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
In relation to the Groups property, plant and equipment note 12, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using historical experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved.
Assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to potential impairment of the carrying value of such assets.
No circumstances have been identified to suggest that this is the case.
The Group has a number of properties which are leased but no longer occupied.
The future cost of these ongoing lease obligations is provided for by way of an onerous property contract provision see note 19.
In determining the level of provision required, the Group assesses the likelihood of mitigating future lease costs as a result of break clauses in leases, or the likelihood of sub-letting the property to third parties.
In doing so, the Group obtains external professional advice where the amounts involved are material.
Goodwill is reviewed annually to assess the requirement for impairment.
Other intangible assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to the conclusion that the carrying value of such assets is not supportable.
Impairment testing on goodwill is carried out in accordance with the analyses described in note 11.
Such calculations require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors and long-term growth prevalent in particular markets as well as short-term business performance.
The Directors draw upon experience as well as external resources in making these judgements.
The charge for share-based payment is calculated in accordance with the analysis described in note 23.
The option valuation models used require subjective assumptions to be made including the future volatility of the Companys share price, expected dividend yields, risk-free interest rates and expected staff turnover.
The Directors draw upon a variety of external sources to aid in the determination of the appropriate data to use in such calculations.
Upon acquisition of a business, its identifiable assets and liabilities are assessed to determine their fair value.
The values attributed to assets and liabilities as part of this process are, where appropriate, based on market values identified for equivalent assets, together with managements experience and assessments.
Where possible, for example in respect of the acquisition of hire assets, comparison is made to the market value of assets of a similar condition and age in the existing business.
72 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 15110 04 06 2008 Proof 5 15110  13 6 08 10:33 Page 73 2 Segmental analysis The Groups primary segmental reporting format is class of business, as the Groups management and internal reporting are structured in this manner.
The Groups activity is conducted solely within the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.
Corporate costs comprise the costs of operating the head office of Speedy Hire Plc and also certain central activities.
These are not directly related to the activities of the segments.
The financing of the Groups activities is undertaken at head office level and consequently net financing costs cannot be analysed segmentally.
The unallocated net assets comprise principally computer and information systems, working capital balances held by the Support Services function and liabilities relating to dividends and taxation and are not directly attributable to the activities of the segments.
3 Exceptional integration costs Integration costs relate to the costs associated with the integration of the Hewden Tools acquisition.
On 1 August 2007, the Group acquired the trade and assets of the tool hire operation of the tool hire operations of Hewden Stuart Plc.
The costs incurred in the year relate to a provision for lease costs associated with properties made vacant by the relocation into the other depots within the tool network 2.9m, a write-off of related fixtures and fittings in the closed depots 1.3m, re-branding and sales and marketing costs 1.5m, costs associated with the transitional services agreement 1.2m, together with consultancy and other one-off costs associated with the integration 3.1m.
In addition, and in connection with the acquisition, the Group renegotiated its banking facilities, increasing the available facilities to 325m.
Costs associated with the original bank facility amounting to 0.4m which were being charged to profit over the life of the facility have been written off during the year.
The resulting tax credit arising from integration costs and bank arrangement fees amounted to 3.1m.
Further details of the acquisition are contained in note 24.
A description of the progress made on the integration programme is included in the operating and financial review on pages 22 to 29.

Of the total NBV of goodwill as at 31 March 2008, 39.3m relates to 2008 acquisitions, 33.1m to 2007 acquisitions, and 13.8m to acquisitions completed prior to 1 April 2007.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at which management monitor that goodwill.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on values in use, which are calculated using cash flow projections for a fifteen year period.
The key assumptions in preparing the cash flow projections are discount rates, growth rates, and expected changes in margins.
The projections are based on business plans approved by management covering the three year period to March 2011, and assume inflationary growth in revenues with no margin improvement for the following twelve years.
As at 31 March 2008, based on the valuations performed, the Directors concluded that the realisable value of the cash-generating units significantly exceeded their carrying value.
A weighted average cost of capital of 9.4% has been used to determine the discounted net present value of the cash flows.

The Group primarily finances its operations using share capital, retained profits and borrowings.
The Group had available a 325m term and revolving credit facility, and a 5m overdraft facility as at 31 March 2008.
The Group does not engage in trading or speculative activities using derivative financial instruments.
A Group offset arrangement exists for cash balances to take advantage of the most rewarding short-term investment opportunities.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities There are no significant differences between the fair values and book values of financial assets and liabilities.
The principal methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows: a Derivatives Broker quotes are used for all interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
b Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
c Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit, interest rate, foreign currency, and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks on an annual basis.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
The exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
No individual customer accounts for more than 4% of the Groups sales transactions.
No collateral is held as security in respect of amounts outstanding, however, in a number of instances, deposits are held against the value of hire equipment provided.
The extent of deposit taken is assessed on a case-by-case basis, and is not considered significant in comparison to the overall amounts receivable from customers.

Given their high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that is based on historical experience of dealing with customers within the same risk profile.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset recorded in the balance sheet.
There are 53.8m of trade receivables that are past due at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against.
There is no indication as at 31 March 2008 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are past due and unprovided.
The ageing of trade receivables net of impairment provision at the end of the year was as follows: 2008 2007 Group m m Not past due 7 74.6 4.6 52.9 Past due 030 days 2 25.1 5.1 19.5 Past due 31120 days 2 24.9 4.9 11.9 Past due 121365 days 3 3.8.

Of these facilities, 70m remained unutilised at the balance sheet date comprising 65m of the revolving credit facility and 5m of the overdraft facility.
The term and revolving loan facility was entered into in June 2007 and is sub-divided into: i A Facility of 100m, which is repayable in three annual instalments of 10m commencing in June 2009, with the remaining 70m being due for repayment in June 2012: and ii B Facility of 225m repayable on the fifth anniversary of the issue date.
The Groups overdrafts are secured by cross guarantees and debentures given by Group companies in favour of Barclays Bank PLC.
The revolving credit facility is secured by a fixed and floating charge over all the assets of the Group.
The Group monitors available facilities against forward requirements on a regular basis and where necessary, obtains additional sources of financing to provide the Group with the appropriate level of headroom against the required borrowing.
The Group has obtained additional bank and equity funding in recent years as the business has grown, and maintains close contact with its syndicate of banks.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
Generally, the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases denominated in euros, primarily as a result of trading in the Republic of Ireland through its subsidiary companies, Speedy Hire Ireland Limited and Waterford Hire Services Limited.
It is the Groups policy to review the net investment in both companies on a regular basis, and to hedge against potential exposures to movements in foreign currency where considered appropriate.
At 31 March 2008, the total shareholders equity of Speedy Hire Ireland Limited had net liabilities of 1.5m 2007: 0.9m and Waterford Hire Services Limited had net assets of 1.5m and no hedging instruments are in place to cover potential movements in foreign currency.

The Groups policy is to review regularly the terms of its borrowing facilities, and to assess and manage the long-term borrowing commitment accordingly, and to put in place interest rate hedges to reduce the Groups exposure to significant fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that between 40% and 70% of its borrowings are covered by some sort of interest rate hedge.
The principal derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
The notional contract amount and the related fair value of the Groups financial instruments can be analysed as follows.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risk the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuation on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 March 2008 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.3m.
Interest rate swaps, caps and collars have been included in this calculation.

A provisional assessment has been made of the fair value to the Group of the assets and liabilities acquired on all acquisitions.
All acquisitions have either been, or are in the process of being, integrated into the existing Speedy Hire businesses.
As such, it is not possible to specifically identify revenue or operating profit arising from the acquisitions.
Hewden Tools The Group acquired the trade and assets of the Hewden Tools business from Hewden Stuart Plc on 1 August 2007, for a total consideration of 118m, comprising entirely cash and acquisition costs.
The Hewden Tools business was a national network of 188 depots, with approximately 1,200 employees.
The initial fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are as follows: Book value at Accounting Fair value acquisition policy alignment adjustment Fair value m m m m Intangible assets 17.9 17.9 Hire equipment assets 32.8 17.9 0.4 50.3 Other property, plant and equipment 7.9 0.5 7.4 Inventory 1.9 0.3 2.2 Trade and other receivables 17.4 3.6 13.8 Trade and other payables 9.4 9.4 50.6 17.9 13.7 82.2 Goodwill capitalised 35.8 Total consideration 118.0 Satisfied by: cash consideration 115.0 costs of acquisition 3.0 118.0 The accounting policy alignment relates to the adjustment of fixed asset lives and residual values to bring the basis into line with the Groups own accounting policy.
An independent valuation to identify and determine the value of any intangible assets has been performed following the acquisition.
Separable intangible assets have been identified in respect of the businesss customer list 13.0m non-compete agreements 4.6m and the use of the Hewden brand for the five-month period to 31 December 2007 0.3m.
The customer list intangible has been valued using the excess earnings method, and is based on income forecast to be generated over the next ten years.
The valuation assumes that the customer attrition rate will be 12.4% per annum, based on management estimates and historical rates recorded by the Company.
Capital asset charges have been applied using risk-adjusted weighted average costs of capital in respect of fixed assets, working capital and the workforce.
Other assumptions used in the valuation include an assumed growth in income from customers of 2.1% per annum.
The customer list intangible is being amortised over ten years, which is considered to be the period over which the majority of the benefits are expected to arise.
The non-compete intangible has been valued using the incremental income method, and is based on estimated income saved by virtue of the non-compete agreement over the contractual period of three years.
The brand intangible has been valued using the relief-from-royalty method, using a royalty rate of 1% of income for the period of ownership.
The intangible was amortised in full during the year as use of the trade name ceased in December 2007.
The Group completed a further three acquisitions during the year.
The Group acquired the trade and certain assets of Network Plant Limited for a total consideration of 2.0m in April 2007.
The Group acquired the entire share capital of Waterford Hire Services Limited, a Company registered in the Republic of Ireland, in July 2007.
The Company is a long-standing, well-respected tool and equipment hire business, with two outlets in Waterford and Kilkenny in the Republic of Ireland.
Total consideration was a maximum of 6.5m, comprising 5.2m in cash and acquisition costs, together with a maximum of 74,587 shares in Speedy Hire Plc.
In February 2008 the Group acquired the trade and certain assets of Amec Logistics and Support Services LSS for a total consideration including fees of 12.7m.
