co. uk website, which is the UKs largest residential property search website.
The address of the Companys registered of ce is 4th Floor, 33 Soho Square, London, W1D 3QU.
Statement of compliance The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union Adopted IFRSs and issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 27 February 2009.
Basis of preparation On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business Review on pages 6 to 15.
The financial position of the Group, its cash ows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described on pages 13 to 15.
In addition Note 4 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has signi cant cash balances of 23,059,000 at 31 December 2008 refer Note 17.
As described in Note 19, the Group entered into a revolving loan facility of up to 40,000,000 during the year.
As at 31 December 2008 39,750,000 was drawn down and has been classi ed as current liabilities.
At a Board meeting on 25 February 2009, the directors con rmed their intention to convert 25,000,000 of the revolving loan facility into a five year term loan by 17 April 2009 as provided for by the existing agreement, subject to standard terms and conditions.
The directors have received written con rmation from the Companys bankers that there are committed bank funds for the conversion at maturity.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in performance show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facility and related bank covenant requirements.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Capital structure The Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 14 November 2007 under the Companies Act 1985 as a private company limited by shares with the name Rightmove Group Limited, registered no.
The Company was re-registered as a public limited company under the name Rightmove Group plc on 29 November 2007.
On 28 January 2008 the Company became the holding company of Rightmove Group Limited formerly Rightmove plc, Company no.
3997679 and its subsidiaries pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement the Scheme under s425 of the Companies Act 1985.
The shares in the Company were admitted to trading on the Of cial List of the London Stock Exchange on 28 January 2008 and it immediately changed its name to Rightmove plc.
Details of the share capital are disclosed in Note 22.
50 rightmove plc annual report 2008 This corporate restructure has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition.
Therefore, the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2008 of the Group are prepared as a continuation of the previously listed companys consolidated financial statements.
The comparative numbers presented in the consolidated financial statements are those reported in the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2007 for the previously listed company, Rightmove plc Company no.
3997679 subsequently renamed Rightmove Group Limited.
The comparative numbers presented for the Company are those of the Company incorporated on 14 November 2007.
There was no change to the Board of directors, management and corporate governance arrangements as a result of the Scheme.
The consolidated assets and liabilities of the Group immediately after the Scheme were substantially the same as the consolidated assets and liabilities of the Group immediately prior thereto.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The minority shareholders of Holiday Lettings Limited HLL have a put option which if exercised requires Rightmove Group Limited to purchase their remaining 33.3% shareholding in HLL.
In accordance with IAS 32, the option for the purchase of the remaining 33.3% shareholding along with the existing investment in HLL of 66.7% has been accounted for at a consolidated level as if the Group holds 100% of the ordinary share capital in HLL and consequently no minority interest is recognised.
The earliest opportunity HLL management has to exercise the put option is 1 July 2009 based on either a multiple of EBIT per the audited accounts for the 12 months for the year ended 31 December 2008 or HLLs market value if higher.
The impact on the consolidated balance sheet is to recognise a liability of 6,133,000 which is based upon the directors' best estimate of likely market value for the business.
This has resulted in an increase of 3,531,000 in deferred consideration and a corresponding increase in goodwill.
In addition an interest charge of 274,000 has been adjusted against deferred consideration in the year as a result of an increase in the present value of the liability.
Judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, information about signi cant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most signi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the following notes: Note 10 Utilisation of tax losses Note 14 Measurement of the recoverable amounts of cash generating units containing goodwill Note 15 Carrying value of investment in subsidiary Note 16 Impairment of trade receivables Note 24 Measurement of share-based payments 2 Signi cant accounting policies a Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment in the Parent company financial statements.
b Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identi able assets acquired.
51 rightmove plc annual report 2008 notes continued 2 Signi cant accounting policies continued In respect of acquisitions prior to this date goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP.
The classi cation and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 was not reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
This applies to all goodwill arising both before and after 1 January 2004.
IFRS 1 permits goodwill on acquisitions made before this date to be brought on to the balance sheet at 1 January 2004 at its carrying value under UK GAAP.
ii Research and development The Group undertakes research and development expenditure in view of developing new products and improving the existing property websites.
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement when incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of a new product or substantially enhanced website, is capitalised if the new product or the enhanced website is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has suf cient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes subcontractors and direct labour.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the economic bene ts embodied in the speci c asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed when incurred.
iii Computer software Computer software is capitalised and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of the computer software by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life as follows: Computer software 20% 33.3% per annum iv Customer relationships Customer relationships are identi ed on the acquisition of a business and valued using discounted cash ows based on historical customer attrition rates.
Amortisation is expensed in the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic life as follows: Customer relationships 16.7% per annum c Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Of ce equipment, xtures & ttings 20% per annum Computer equipment 20% per annum d Impairment The carrying value of the property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of nonfinancial assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash ows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
52 rightmove plc annual report 2008 Intangible assets that have an inde nite useful life and intangibles which are not available for use are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at the IFRS transition date: no impairment was deemed necessary.
An impairment test is performed annually at 31 December on goodwill regardless of the existence of impairment indicators.
Investments are assessed for possible impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the investments may be below the Companys carrying value.
When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount written off is included in net income.
In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance and the Companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be suf cient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value.
e Financial instruments Trade receivables are recognised at fair value less any impairment loss.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Trade payables are recognised at fair value.
Trade payables are classi ed as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with borrowings.
After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost and any difference between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
f Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash ow.
g Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an out ow of economic bene ts will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risk speci c to the liability.
A provision is maintained in respect of vacant leasehold properties where the lease is considered to be onerous to take account of the net present value of residual lease commitments over the remaining term of the lease.
h Employee bene ts i Pensions The Group provides access to a stakeholder pension scheme fide ned contribution plan into which employees may elect to contribute via salary deduction.
Obligations for contributions to fide ned contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee bene t expense in the income statement when they are due.
ii Employee share schemes The share option programme allows certain senior management employees to acquire shares in the Company.
An expense is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period to which the employees become unconditionally entitled, on equity settled share-based payment schemes granted after 7 November 2002 and which have not vested by 1 January 2005.
Awards made before this date are not accounted for under IFRS 2, as permitted under the transitional rules of IFRS 1.
For awards made after 7 November 2002 and not vested by 1 January 2005, the charge is based on the fair value of the option granted as at the grant date, calculated using an option pricing model.
iii Own shares held by The Rightmove Employees Share Trust EBT The EBT is treated as an agent of Rightmove Group Limited and as such EBT transactions are treated as being those of Rightmove Group Limited and are therefore re ected in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In particular, at a consolidated level, the EBTs purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
53 rightmove plc annual report 2008 notes continued 2 Signi cant accounting policies continued i Treasury shares and shares purchased for cancellation When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are either held in treasury or cancelled.
j Revenue Revenue principally represents the amounts, excluding value added tax VAT, receivable from customers in respect of properties advertised on the website.
Revenue relating to properties advertised on the website is recognised in the month to which it relates.
Estate agency and Overseas branches are billed in advance with net income deferred until the service commencement date.
The VAT liability is recognised at the point of invoice.
New homes developers are typically billed monthly in arrears.
Where invoices are raised on other than a monthly basis, the amounts are recognised as deferred or accrued revenue and released to the income statement on a monthly basis in line with the provision of services as stipulated in the contract terms.
HLL revenue is billed in advance.
The majority of the HLL revenue relates to a 12 month period although some is billed quarterly.
This revenue is spread equally over the period with any deferred revenue held on the balance sheet.
k Segmental reporting A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Group engaged in providing products and services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The Groups primary format for segmental reporting is by business segment.
l Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the income statement.
m Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Where cash is received in exchange for entering into a lease with rates above market value, this upfront payment is deferred and released on a straight line basis over the lease term.
n Financial income and expenses Financial income comprises interest receivable on cash balances and deposits.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Financial expenses comprise debt issue costs, preference dividend interest, interest payable on bank loans and the unwinding of the discount on the HLL deferred consideration.
Interest payable is recognised on an accruals basis.
o Taxation Income tax on the results for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable pro t other than in a business combination and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro ts will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
In accordance with IAS 12, the Group policy in relation to the recognition of tax on share-based payments is to include the income tax effect of the excess tax deduction in the income statement to the value of the income tax charge on the cumulative IFRS 2 charge.
The remainder of the income tax effect of the excess tax deduction is recognised in equity.
54 rightmove plc annual report 2008 p Dividends Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability and deduction to equity at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
q Earnings per share The Group presents basic, diluted and underlying earnings per share EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the pro t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the pro t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive instruments, which comprise share options granted to employees.
The calculation of underlying EPS is disclosed in Note 11.
3 IFRSs not yet applied A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2008 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
The standards and interpretations to be adopted include: Effective date IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 1 2009 Revised IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments Vesting Conditions and Cancellations 1 1 2009 Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2008 1 1 2010 Revised IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements 2007 1 1 2009 Amended IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 2008 1 1 2010 Not yet endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments introduces the management approach to segment reporting and will require a change in the presentation and disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each segments performance and to allocate resources to them.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments Vesting Conditions and Cancellations clari es the fide nition of vesting conditions, introduces the concept of non-vesting conditions to be re ected in grant date fair value and provides the accounting treatment for non-vesting conditions and cancellations.
Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2008 incorporates the following changes that are likely to be relevant to the Groups operations: The fide nition of a business has been broadened, which is likely to result in more acquisitions being treated as business com binations: Contingent consideration will be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes therein recognised in pro t or loss: Transaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred: Any pre-existing interest in the acquiree will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in pro t or loss: Any non-controlling minority interest will be measured at either fair value, or at its proportionate interest in the identi able assets and liabilities of the acquiree, on a transaction by transaction basis.
Revised IFRS 3, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements, will be applied prospectively and therefore there will be no impact on prior years.
Revised IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements 2007 introduces the term total comprehensive income, which represents changes in equity during a period other than those changes resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as owners.
This is expected to have a signi cant impact on the presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
The Group plans to provide total comprehensive income in a single statement of comprehensive income for its 2009 consolidated financial statements.
Amended IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 2008 requires accounting for changes in ownership interests by the Group in a subsidiary, while maintaining control, to be recognised as an equity transaction.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, any interest retained in the former subsidiary will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in pro t or loss.
The amendments to IAS 27, which become mandatory for the Groups 2010 consolidated financial statements, are not expected to have a signi cant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
55 rightmove plc annual report 2008 notes continued 4 Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk This note presents information about the Group and Companys exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The primary method by which risks are monitored and managed by the Group is through the monthly Executive Management Board, where any signi cant new risks or change in status to existing risks will be discussed and actions taken as appropriate.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to re ect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups internal controls and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is in uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The Group provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an in uence on credit risk.
The Group provides its services to a wide range of customers in the UK and overseas and therefore believes it has no material concentration of credit risk.
More than 69% of the Groups customers pay via monthly direct debit, minimising the risk of non-payment.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables based on individually identi ed loss exposures.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group and Companys approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have suf cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups revenue model is largely subscription-based which results in a regular level of cash conversion allowing it to service working capital requirements.
The Group and Company ensure that they have suf cient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses excluding the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.
As at 31 December 2008 the Group had suf cient cash on demand to meet operational expenses, before nancing activities, for a period of 113 days 31 December 2007: 220 days.
As at 31 December 2008 the Group had bank borrowings of 39,750,000, which have been classi ed as current liabilities: however it is anticipated that 25,000,000 will be converted into a long term loan as set out in Note 1 Going Concern.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the Groups income.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
56 rightmove plc annual report 2008 Currency risk 99% of the Groups sales are Sterling denominated, with the balance being Euro denominated.
As the value of Euro denominated trade receivables is low in relation to total receivables, no amounts are hedged.
Interest rate risk The Group and Company have interest bearing financial liabilities.
The Group and Company are exposed to interest rate risk on the bank loan facility, cash balances and the deferred consideration in relation to the acquisition of HLL.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain an ef cient balance sheet with an appropriate level of leverage for the size of the business so as to maintain investor, creditor and market con dence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board monitors the spread of the Companys shareholders, as well as the return on capital and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
As at 31 December 2008 the directors and senior managers hold 3.4% of the ordinary share capital of the Company excluding shares held in treasury.
In addition the executive directors are regarded as being interested, for the purposes of the Companies Act 1985, in 8,353,700 7.1% ordinary shares in the Company currently held by the EBT as they are, together with other employees, potential bene ciaries of the EBT.
The Company purchases its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market conditions.
In April 2008 the Company entered into a revolving loan facility in order to support its continuing share buy back programme.
Of the 11,854,535 shares bought back during 2008, 9,349,105 have been cancelled, with the balance transferred into treasury, providing exibility for future share option issues.
There were no changes in the Group's approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
5 Segmental reporting The Group does not have geographical segments with substantially all revenue derived from external operations in the UK in both years.
Revenue derived outside the UK is not material in either 2007 or 2008.
All activities in the year relate to the property advertising segment and there were no other separately identi able business segment income statement or balance sheet items.
