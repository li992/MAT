IFRS requires fair value changes for derivatives, which do not meet the tests for hedge accounting under IAS39, to be included in the income statement.
In addition, certain exchange differences are required to be included in the income statement under IFRS and, as they are subject to exchange rate movements in a period, they can be a volatile element of net finance costs.
These amounts do not always reflect an economic gain or loss for the Group and, accordingly, the Group has decided that, in calculating the adjusted diluted earnings per share, it is appropriate to exclude certain amounts.
The adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2008 note 7 exclude, in line with previous practice, an 11 million loss 2007: nil relating to exchange losses in net finance costs where there is a compensating exchange gain reflected in differences in exchange taken directly to the Statement of recognised income and expense.
