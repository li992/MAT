a Wages and salaries Wages and salaries include the following: 1 Bonus plans The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the Companys shareholders.
2 Share-based payments These are detailed in section b of this Note.
3 Phantom equity-based compensation The Group also operates phantom cash-settled, equity-based compensation plans.
The equity base is typically some of the fund products of which the Group is the investment manager.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the phantom equity awards is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, remeasured at each reporting date until the settlement date is reached.
The fair value of the awards equates to the fair value of the underlying fund products at the settlement date.

The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the share awards and options granted is recognised as an expense, with the corresponding credit being recognised in equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and options awarded granted, excluding the impact of any nonmarket vesting conditions for example, earnings per share and return on equity targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions made on the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.

Employees and compensation continued All of the employee share awards and share option awards are made within the Groups share-based remuneration schemes.
Details of these schemes may be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 44-45.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
During the year, $71 million was charged to the income statement for equity-settled, share-based payment transactions 2007: $43 million in respect of continuing operations.
The fair value of share options and awards is calculated using a binomial lattice model that takes into account the effect of both financial and demographic assumptions.
Financial assumptions include the future share price volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and the best estimate outcome of non-market based performance conditions.
Demographic assumptions include forfeiture and early vesting behaviours that are based upon historic observable data.
The fair values per option and award granted during the year to employees, and the assumptions used in the calculations, are as follows: Other Executive employee Share Option share option Performance Co-Investment Scheme schemes Share Plan Scheme Grant dates 7 6 2007 2 7 2007 7 6 2007 11 6 2007 1 8 2007 9 1 2008 Weighted average share price at grant date 1124c 1099c 1124c 1128c Weighted average exercise price at grant date 1124c 962c Share options awards made in the year 816,832 744,845 1,833,154 6,247,858 Vesting period years 3 2-5 4 4 Expected share price volatility 30.0% 30.0% Dividend yield 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% Risk-free rate 5.5% 5.7% Expected option life years 8.7 3.7 Number of shares options assumed to vest 816,832 660,557 1,833,154 6,064,674 Average fair value per option share granted 357c 232c 998c 935c The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility over the last 10 years.
The expected option life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon US and UK where appropriate government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
It is assumed that the performance conditions applicable to the executive share option scheme and performance share plan will be met in full.
For the executive share option scheme, it is assumed that 5% of options per year are subject to early exercise, and in addition, provided there is a gain of 50% on the exercise price, it is assumed that 50% of remaining option holders will exercise per year.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding are as follows: 2008 2007 Weighted avg.
As invested awards do not participate in dividends, there is no impact arising from the share consolidation.
The share options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average exercise price and expected remaining life as follows: 2008 2007 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted avg.

The Groups pension plans are funded through payments to trustee-administered funds or insurance companies, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
Other than pensions, the Group does not operate any other form of post-retirement benefit plans.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund.
i Defined contribution plans For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Defined contribution pension costs for continued operations totalled $9 million 2007: $9 million.
ii Defined benefit plans The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
In accordance with the transitional provisions set out in IFRS 1 First time adoption of international financial reporting standards, all cumulative actuarial gains and losses at the date of the Groups IFRS transition 1 April 2004 were recognised in full.
Since 1 April 2004, actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are not recognised in the current period unless the cumulative unrecognised gain or loss at the end of the previous reporting period exceeds the greater of 10% of the plan assets or liabilities.
In these circumstances the excess is charged or credited to the income statement over the employees expected average remaining working lives.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuations of the two plans as at 31 March 2008 were: UK plan Swiss plan 2008 2007 2008 2007 % pa % pa % pa % pa Discount rate 6.9 5.4 3.8 3.0 Price inflation 3.8 3.2 1.5 1.5 Expected return on plan assets 7.2 6.9 3.3 3.0 Future salary increases 6.4 5.8 5.0 5.0 Social security increases 1.8 1.8 Pension in payment increases 4.0 3.5 Deferred pensions increases 5.0 5.0 Actuarial valuations are conducted every three years.
The latest actuarial valuation of the largest plan, the Man Group plc Pension Fund the UK plan, the UK defined benefit pension plan, was made at 31 December 2005, using the Projected Unit Credit method.
This is a closed plan and the current service cost is expected to increase as the members approach retirement.
For the UK plan, the Group has agreed to contribute 34.2% of pensionable salaries each year until 31 December 2008.
The following paragraphs discuss the key assumptions applied and sensitivities in the valuation of the Groups largest plan, the UK plan, which, at 31 March 2008, comprised 83% 2007: 90% of the total pension liability.
The discount rate is based on yields on high quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration.
At 31 March 2008, the annualised yield on the index constructed by iBoxx of AA rated stocks of duration of 15 years or more, was 6.9% 2007: 5.4%.
The mean term of the 15-year index falls short of the mean term of the liabilities of the Fund of around 20 years, but in the absence of suitable data, the iBoxx yields are thought to be an appropriate guide.
The expected return on plan assets is based on the market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
Investment market conditions suggest an expected return on equities of around 8.3% 2007: 8.0%, expected bond returns of around 5.9% 2007: 5.2%, and expected return on other plan assets hedge funds, cash of around 8.2% 2007: 7.6%.
The pension increase entitlement for the majority of members in the Fund is RPI subject to a minimum of 3.0% per annum and a maximum of 5.0% per annum.
Pension increases have been assumed to be at a rate of 4.0% 2007: 3.5% per annum reflecting the possibility that future increases are likely to be higher than price inflation.

Employees and compensation continued In light of recent experience, which suggests that there has been lower mortality than previously assumed, it is thought appropriate to update the mortality tables to allow for the general improvements being experienced.
As a result, the table of mortality rates PA92C05 with no age rating has been used since 2007.
In addition, allowance is made for future improvements in mortality rates by reducing the discount rate by 0.25% per annum, which increases the balance sheet liability.
The table below sets out the expectations of life for male and female members currently, and life expectancy in 20 years time.
Current life Life expectancy expectancy in 20 years time years years Male aged 60 24.4 25.8 Female aged 60 27.5 28.8 Following the separation of Brokerage from the Group Note 25, a new pension plan sponsored by MF Global UK Limited was established for the Brokerage employees who immediately prior to the separation, were active members of the UK plan.
With effect from 1 July 2007, all eligible Brokerage employees consented to transfer and joined the MF Global UK Pension Fund, accruing pension rights from that fund for service from that date.
The provisions of this new plan are identical to those of the UK scheme.
The assets of the UK plan were apportioned on a share of fund basis, reflecting the respective values of the accrued pension rights of consenting members transferring to the new plan, and those remaining behind in the UK plan.
Effective 1 July 2007, $27 million of fund assets were transferred from the UK plan to the MF Global UK Pension Fund in full settlement of future pension obligations arising from the consenting members.
