Notes to the Financial Statements continued 13 Contingent asset re VAT In 2004 JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust plc and the AIC launched a joint appeal for the payment of investment trust management fees to be exempt from VAT.
The JPMorgan Claverhouse & The Association of Investment Companies v HM Revenue & Customs case has concluded with HM Revenue & Customs HMRC announcing that it has decided not to appeal the decision issued by the European Court of Justice ECJ.
On 28 June 2007, the ECJ concluded that the management of investment trusts, like authorised unit trusts and OEICs, should be an exempt service for the purposes of VAT.
As a result, management services supplied to investment trusts were exempt from UK VAT with immediate effect and the Company is entitled to seek reimbursement of VAT paid in the past.
The Companys previous Manager, Henderson Global Investors, has filed protective claims for the period between 1 February 2001 and 30 September 2004 and the Companys current Manager has filed a claim for the period from 1 October 2004, and as a result, an amount in excess of 6 million is potentially recoverable for this period.
Furthermore a decision in the Court of Appeal has opened the possibility for additional VAT recovery from HMRC for the period from 1 January 1990 to 4 December 1996.
There is no potential claim for the intervening period from 5 December 1996 to 31 January 2001.
In the absence of a definitive agreement with the Manager or specific guidance from HMRC as to how the reclaims will be effected, there is not yet certainty as to the amount or timing of any recovery.
Accordingly no asset has been recognised in the accounts at 31 March 2008.
Any amounts recovered will be allocated 81% to the Ordinary share class and 19% to the Sigma share class i. e. on the basis of the conversion of Ordinary shares into Sigma shares on creation of the Sigma share class.
