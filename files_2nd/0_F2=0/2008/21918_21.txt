The principal changes from the Companys existing Articles of Association are as follows: General The current Articles and definitions within them are being amended to accommodate the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 CA06.
Share Transfers In the unlikely event that the Company refused to register a transfer of shares, it would now have to give the transferee an explanation of the reason for the refusal.
This was not previously the case.
Convening General Meetings The minimum notice required to convene General Meetings will be that prescribed by Statute.
This is currently 21 days for the Annual General Meeting and 14 days for any other General Meeting.
Votes of Members The New Articles provide for multiple proxies to be appointed, provided each exercises the rights attaching to different shares, and for proxies to speak and vote at meetings not just vote on a poll.
Conflicts of Interest CA06 sets out Directors general duties, which largely codify the existing law but with some changes.
Directors must now avoid situations where they have, or might have, a direct or indirect interest which conflicts or might conflict with the Companys interests.
This is a very wide requirement and merely holding a position as a trustee or being a director of another company might give rise to a potential conflict.
CA06 accordingly permits the non-conflicted Directors of a public company to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts disclosed to them by a Director and the New Articles will give the Directors this authority.
In exercising the authority the Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, to be most likely to promote the Companys success.
They may also impose limits or conditions eg prohibiting access to confidential information on a conflicted Director where appropriate.
Electronic and web communications Provisions have been inserted to enable communication with members by electronic means and or a website.
Directors indemnities The Companys power to indemnify Directors and fund expenditure incurred in connection with legal action against Directors has been expanded in line with CA06.
Directors fees Under the current Articles the aggregate Directors fees were last increased in 2003.
Accordingly the Company proposes taking the opportunity to increase the aggregate from 150,000 to 200,000 to provide greater flexibility for the long term.
