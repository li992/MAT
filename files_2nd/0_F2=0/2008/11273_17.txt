The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates these cash flows in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector.
The growth rate used is not more than 3.0% 2006 07: not more than 3.0%, and is not considered to be higher than the average long term industry growth rate.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.1% 2006 07: 10.0%.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Management believe that these balances have low credit risk because the Groups top five customers, all leading UK retailers, represent more than 75% of the Groups revenue.
This results in a high concentration of credit risk, however, these customers have good credit ratings and consequently the credit risk for the Groups overall trade receivables is considered low.
Included in the trade receivables balance are receivables with a carrying amount of 9.5m 2006 07 5.8m which are past due at the period end for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of these receivables which are past due but not impaired is 17 days 2006 07: 22 days.

The carrying amounts of short term borrowings and the Revolving credit facility 2010 approximate to their fair value.
The fair value of the Senior loan notes 20122017 is disclosed below: 2008 2008 2007 2007 Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value m m m m Senior loan notes 20122017 131.6 139.0 132.6 132.0 At the period end the Group had available 330.0m 2006 07: 375.0m of undrawn committed facilities on the Revolving credit facility 2010 and 4.7m bank overdrafts 2006 07: 14.6m, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
26 Financing Bank overdrafts All bank loans and overdrafts are unsecured and repayable on demand, and are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The interest rate on bank overdrafts is 1.0% 2006 07: 1.0% above the Bank of England base rate.
Revolving credit facility 2010 The Group holds a five year syndicated revolving credit facility of 460.0m.
At the period end, the amount due under the facility was 130.0m 2006 07: 85.0m.
The amount drawn down is repayable in periods of up to one year but is capable of being immediately refinanced as part of the committed Revolving credit facility 2010.
The rate of interest fluctuates in line with market rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The maturity profile of the Revolving credit facility 2010 is shown below.
This assumes that the interest paid during future years is paid at the interest rate 5.85% and the level of debt drawn down remains consistent with the rates and borrowings at the balance sheet date.

Notes are in both US Dollars $155.0m and pounds Sterling 54.3m.
The notes are fixed rate and unsecured.
Following the business disposals in the prior period, the Group may have been required by the note holders to make a part repayment during 2007 08.
As an appropriate proportion of the proceeds was reinvested in acquisitions or capital investment no repayment has been required.
The maturity profile below shows the annual cash flows paid in both the current and prior year.
The cash flow hedge is currently effective.
In consequence, the interest payments are fixed and are accounted for in the Consolidated income statement on an accruals basis.
The charge to the Consolidated income statement corresponds to the annual interest paid.
The repayment of the principal amount will not enter into the determination of profit or loss unless the hedge becomes ineffective.
The effectiveness of the cash flow hedge is assessed at each balance sheet date.

Northern Foods will receive each 20 December and 20 June the bond interest payment dates fixed USD sufficient to fully cover interest due to holders of the USD denominated bonds, in exchange for payment of fixed pounds Sterling on the same date.
The weighted average interest rate payable in pounds Sterling by the Company is approximately 5.5%.
Additionally, the swap contracts provide for an exchange of the principal amounts at maturity at the same rate of exchange as the initial principal was translated 1 $1.752.
27 Financial instruments Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns whilst maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, as disclosed in note 28, and equity shareholders funds, as disclosed in notes 30 and 31.
Board policy is to operate with fixed rate borrowings within a range of 20% to 50% of total net debt over the medium term, although the Group may operate outside of this range in the short term.
At the year end 71% of the Groups debt was fixed 2006 07: 81%.
The proportion of fixed rate borrowings increased in the prior period after the business disposals were made during 2006 07.
A net debt review is carried out by management on a weekly basis.
The Group has performed share buy-backs during the period and funded acquisitions.
During the period, the company repurchased 6,056,846 shares at a cost of 5.3m 2006 07: nil shares and made three acquisitions 2006 07: nil as discussed in note 12.

The fair value of the financial liability held at amortised cost in a cash flow hedging relationship has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying period end exchange rates.
The disclosure of the fair value is also shown in note 25.
The directors use their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for derivatives that are designated and effective as hedging instruments carried at fair value, but that are not quoted in an active market.
Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied and assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument.
The fair value of the other financial liabilities at amortised cost approximates to their carrying value.
The trade and other payables approximate to their fair value due to the short term nature of the payables.
The finance lease fair value approximates to the carrying value based on discounted future cash flows.
Financial risk management objectives The Group collates information from across the business and reports to the Board of directors on key financial risks on a monthly basis.
These risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
The Group seeks to minimise its exposure to these risks by using derivative financial instruments where applicable.
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by Group policies which have been approved by the Board of directors.
The Group only enters into trade financial instruments for specific purposes.
Speculative purchases are not made.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty defaults on its contractual obligations of the loans and receivables at amortised cost held in the balance sheet.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The Groups top five customers, all leading UK retailers, continue to represent more than 75% of the Groups revenue.
These customers have favourable credit ratings and consequently reduce the credit risk for the Groups overall trade receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Processes are in place to manage receivables and overdue debt and to ensure that appropriate action is taken to resolve issues on a timely basis.
Credit control operating procedures are in place to review all new customers.
Existing customers are reviewed as management become aware of changes of circumstances for specific customers.
During the period, the amount written off in respect of credit risk was 0.3m 2006 07: 0.3m.
84 Notes to the consolidated financial statements | Northern Foods plc 27 Financial instruments continued The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of appropriate allowance for doubtful trade receivables, specific customer risk and assessment of the current economic environment.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group may not be able to fund the day to day running of the Group.
Liquidity risk is reviewed by the Board on a monthly basis.
The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring actual and forecast cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group also monitors the drawdown of debt against the available banking facilities and reviews the level of reserves.
Liquidity risk management ensures sufficient debt funding is available for the Groups day to day needs.
Board policy is to maintain reasonable headroom of unused committed bank facilities in a range of maturities at least 12 months beyond the period end.
The Group has two principal debt facilities notes 25 and 26 : Revolving credit facility 2010 Senior loan notes 20122017 The following table details the Groups maturity profile of its financial liabilities excluding derivative financial instruments : Less than 3 months to 1 month 13 months 1 year 15 years 5 years Total 2008 m m m m m m Senior loan notes 20122017 3.8 3.7 73.6 98.2 179.3 Trade payables 69.4 31.3 100.7 Bank loans and overdrafts 0.3 0.3 Revolving credit facility 2010 0.6 1.3 5.7 139.8 147.4 Finance leases 0.2 0.6 0.8 70.3 36.4 9.6 214.0 98.2 428.5 Less than 3 months to 1 month 13 months 1 year 15 years 5 years Total 2007 m m m m m m Senior loan notes 20122017 3.8 3.7 76.7 103.0 187.2 Trade payables 71.4 32.2 103.6 Bank loans and overdrafts 0.4 0.4 Revolving credit facility 2010 0.4 0.8 3.7 96.4 101.3 72.2 36.8 7.4 173.1 103.0 392.5 The liquidity profile of the trade payables has been assumed consistent with the Groups payment terms of 45 days 2006 07: 45 days.

The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
Interest risk management balances debt financing as a tool to improve the returns through leverage in the capital structure with the potential for an increase in interest rates to impact profits negatively.
Board policy is to operate with fixed rate borrowings within a range of 20% to 50% of total net borrowings over the medium term although the Group may operate outside this range in the short term.
At the year end 71% of the Groups net debt is fixed 2006 07: 81%.
Board approval is required for the use of any interest rate derivative.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis has been performed on the financial assets and liabilities to illustrate the impact on Group profits and equity if interest rates increased decreased.
This analysis assumes the liabilities outstanding at the period end were outstanding for the whole period.
A 50 bps increase or decrease has been used, comprising managements assessment of reasonably possible changes in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 50 bps higher lower, then profit before taxation for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2008 would have decreased increased by 0.7m 2006 07: 0.4m and equity at the balance sheet date would have decreased increased by 0.8m 2006 07: 0.6m.
It has been assumed that all other variables remained the same when preparing the interest rate sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management Foreign currency risk management occurs at a transactional level on revenues and purchases in foreign currencies and at a translational level in relation to the translation of overseas operations.
Board policy is for UK businesses to hedge transactional exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts wherever material.
Transactional exposure in our Irish business is not hedged, however, there is a partially offsetting translation exposure.
The Senior loan notes 20122017 have been hedged using cross currency interest rate swaps of similar maturity subject to a one off right for the counterparty bank to break the swap after seven years at the market value of the swap at that date.
The Group monitors foreign exchange rates to assess the potential impact on Group profits if exchange rates move significantly and a summary of hedges in place is reported monthly to the Board.
The Groups main foreign exchange risk is to the Euro.
During the 52 week period to 29 March 2008, the Euro strengthened against GBP by 14%, mainly in the second half of the year, with the closing rate at 1.2621 compared to 1.4735 at the prior period end.
The average rate for the 52 week period to 29 March 2008 was 1.42, a reduction of 3.5% versus prior year and the net impact on profit of transaction losses offset by translation gains was a charge of 1.2m.
The overseas subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro, has pounds Sterling assets and liabilities at both balance sheet dates.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on these pounds Sterling financial assets and liabilities to sensitivity of a 10% increase decrease in pounds Sterling to Euro exchange rate.
A 10% increase decrease has been used, comprising managements assessment of reasonably possible changes in Euro exchange rates.
The impact on profit for the period is an increase decrease of 0.3m 2006 07: increase decrease of 1.8m and the impact on equity is an increase decrease of 0.3m 2006 07 increase decrease of 1.8m.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the financial assets and liabilities to sensitivity of a 10% increase decrease in the pounds Sterling to US Dollar exchange rate.
A 10% increase decrease has been used, comprising managements assessment of reasonably possible changes in US Dollar exchange rates.
The impact on profit for the period is an increase decrease of nil 2006 07: nil and on equity is an increase decrease of 1.1m 2006 07: 0.5m.
86 Notes to the consolidated financial statements | Northern Foods plc 27 Financial instruments continued Forward foreign exchange contracts Group policy in 2007 08 and prior periods was to hedge individual capital expenditure foreign currency transactions of more than 0.3m.

Cross currency interest rate swaps The Company has cross currency interest rate swaps to provide a cash flow hedge against currency and interest rate movements on the US$155.0m Senior loan notes 20122017.
Swap contracts with a nominal value of US$155.0m 88.5m have fixed sterling interest payments at an average rate of 5.5% for periods up to 2017 and have fixed USD interest receipts at an average rate of 5.76%.
At the period end, swap contracts had a negative fair value of 4.1m 2006 07: negative 6.5m.
The cash flow hedge forms part of the Groups risk management strategy which is reviewed and authorised by the Board.
The fixed cash flows will be achieved through the use of cross currency interest rate swaps.
The actual risk being hedged is the foreign exchange risk.
The Group uses the Dollar offset hypothetical derivative method to test the effectiveness of the hedge.
The cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative is compared to the cumulative fair value changes of the hedge instrument.
The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward foreign exchange rates and yield curves from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The maturity profile is shown on page 85.
28 Analysis of net debt References to net debt refer to the total borrowings of the Group, including both short term and long term bank loans, bonds, loan notes and finance leases, after offsetting the cash and cash equivalents of the business and short term investments.
Net debt will also include the proportion of the fair value of the currency swaps hedging the balance sheet value of the Groups Dollar denominated loan notes.
The table below reconciles net debt: 2008 2007 m m Cash and cash equivalents 72.9 48.3 Trading investments 0.1 4.9 Bank loans, overdrafts and loan notes due within one year 0.3 0.4 Finance leases 0.8 Revolving credit facility 2010 130.0 85.0 Senior loan notes 2012-2017 131.6 132.6 Currency element of fair value of swaps hedging the Groups US Dollar denominated loan notes 10.5 9.4 Net debt 200.2 174.2 Net debt Net debt is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with other similarly titled non-IFRS debt measures reported by other companies.
The Group adopts this measure because it is used in calculating the banking covenants.
It is also the measure used for internal debt analysis.
In addition, the net debt balance provides an indication of the net borrowings on which the Company is required to pay interest.

The rate reduction has been substantively enacted and therefore has been used for the deferred tax calculation on UK businesses.
Although amendments to the Industrial Buildings Allowance regime were also proposed in the Finance Act 2007, these amendments were not substantively enacted at 29 March 2008 and accordingly have not been reflected in the Groups results for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2008.
The directors have estimated that, had these amendments been reflected in the Groups results for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2008 in respect of existing industrial buildings held by the Group, the effect would be to increase the deferred tax liability held in the balance sheet by approximately 10.7m.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with unremitted earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 17.4m 2006 07: 14.4m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax has been provided on capital losses totalling 155.5m at 29 March 2008 2006 07: 94.0m as it is uncertain when these losses will be utilised against future taxable gains.

92 Notes to the consolidated financial statements | Northern Foods plc 36 Equity settled share based payments continued Performance conditions notes A Performance condition measured by reference to earnings per share.
The target requires that the real growth in earnings per share over the three year performance period is greater than 3% per annum compound.
The performance condition allows for retesting after years four and five against the full period from the grant.
C Performance condition measured by reference to earnings per share.
The performance condition does not allow for retesting.
D The LTIP has two performance conditions.
TSR: The total number of shares that will vest will be up to 50% dependent on how the TSR in relation to an ordinary share of Northern Foods over the relevant performance period compares with TSR in relation to the ordinary shares of the companies in the comparator group in the same period.
Where the TSR of Northern Foods over the performance period places it between the median and the upper quartile the number of shares will be calculated on a straight line basis with 20% of the shares being received when Northern Foods is placed above median, and 50% being received where Northern Foods is placed in the upper quartile.
Where Northern Foods growth in TSR places it below median, no shares will vest in relation to this element of the award.
Return on invested capital ROIC : 50% of the total award vests on achievement of a minimum growth in ROIC over the performance period.
Growth in ROIC over the period has to be 100 or more basis points.
The number of shares that each participant receives is calculated on a straight line basis with 7.5% of the shares being received if Northern Foods achieves growth of 100 basis points and maximum of 50% being received if the Company achieves growth of 200 basis points.
E Under the Share bonus plan, 80% of annual bonus opportunity is linked to specific financial targets, including targets for profit from operations and profit before tax, both measured before restructuring items.
The other 20% is directly related to individual performance against personal performance contracts set at the start of the financial year, which contain six individual and business performance targets which are considered appropriately stretching.
F The Deferred share bonus plan DSBP was introduced in June 2006 so as to incentivise and retain the key talent necessary to drive the specific performance improvements required.
Performance was assessed against key milestones over the 12 month period to 31 March 2007.
These four key milestones related to improving free cash flow and reducing net debt as at 1 April 2006 by 125m, reducing the run rate for central costs by 12m per annum compared to 2005 06 and the successful resolution of the pension deficit.
This DSBP provided approximately 40 senior executives with an award of shares with a value up to 100% of base salary, at the prevailing market price of 81.75 pence per share on 13 July 2006.
These shares will be satisfied by the transfer of existing shares held in trust after the vesting date in July 2009.
G The Performance share plan was introduced to incentivise the Groups senior executives.
There are two performance conditions which will align the interests of senior executives with those of shareholders.
TSR: The total number of shares that will vest will be up to 50% dependent on TSR growth over the performance period.
TSR is required to grow by 30% from the effective base of 1.24 for 7.5% of the shares to vest up to a maximum of 50% being received if the TSR grows by 80% or more.
ROIC: 50% of the total award vests on achievement of a minimum growth in ROIC over the performance period.
The number of shares that each participant receives is calculated on a straight line basis with 7.5% of the shares being received if the Group achieves growth of 100 basis points and maximum of 50% being received if the Group achieves growth of 200 basis points or more.
H The award of matching shares to S Barden was made as part of his recruitment as chief executive.
The performance conditions attached to the matching share award are the same as those for the Performance share plan see G save that threshold vesting of the TSR element will not occur unless the Group achieves growth in TSR of 35% over the relevant period.
Half the matching award will vest on the third anniversary of the grant with the other half vesting on the fourth anniversary of grant to the extent that the performance conditions are met and providing he retains the purchased shares and remains employed by the Group.
I The Group introduced an HM Revenue & Customs approved savings-related share option plan for all employees.
There are no performance conditions attached to these options.

37 Retirement benefit obligations Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees, principally the Northern Foods Pension Scheme the Scheme and Northern Foods Pension Builder Pension Builder in the United Kingdom and the Green Isle Foods Group Retirement and Death Benefit Plan the Plan in the Republic of Ireland.
Under the Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan, employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on pay and service.
The Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan are funded schemes whilst the Post retirement medical benefit scheme is unfunded.
The Scheme and the Plan are final salary schemes.
The assets of the Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan are held in trustee administered funds separate from the finances of the Group.
On 22 March 2005 the Company announced the closure of the Scheme to new entrants and withdrew its agreement to allow early retirement on an enhanced basis.
Pension Builder was introduced on 1 May 2005 and is available to all UK based employees.
Pension Builder is a defined benefit scheme based on the career average principle.
The most recent valuation of the Scheme for the purpose of the financial statements and the present value of defined benefit obligations was carried out at 29 March 2008 by an independent qualified actuary,  LLP.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation asset, the related current service cost and past service cost was measured using the Projected unit credit method.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and Pension Builder are detailed below.
Valuation date 2008 2007 Rate of increase in salaries 3.9% 4.0% Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.1% 2.9% Rate of increase to deferred pensions 3.4% 3.0% Discount rate 6.4% 5.3% Inflation assumption 3.4% 3.0% 94 Notes to the consolidated financial statements | Northern Foods plc 37 Retirement benefit obligations continued Sensitivities The mortality assumptions used are based on mortality experience of the Scheme and anticipated mortality experience.
The assumptions are below the national average reflecting the socio-economic make up of the Scheme membership.
For the valuation at 29 March 2008, the Company has adopted the medium cohort principle for the Scheme and Pension Builder 2006 07: short cohort.
If life expectancy is increased or decreased by one year, liabilities are estimated to increase or decrease by 15m respectively.
The impact of a 0.1% increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase liabilities by 13m respectively.
The life expectancy in years for a member aged 65 is as follows: Valuation date 2008 2007 years years Current pensioner male 18.7 17.7 female 21.0 19.8 Future pensioner male 20.0 18.4 female 22.2 20.5 Post retirement medical benefit scheme Until 31 March 1999, the Group operated a post retirement medical benefit scheme.
The method of accounting, assumptions and the frequency of valuations are similar to those used for defined benefit pension schemes detailed on page 94.
The main actuarial assumptions are the underlying medical cost inflation of 5.4% per annum 2006 07: 5.0% and the discount rate of 6.4% per annum 2006 07: 5.3%.
If the assumed rate of underlying medical cost inflation increased or decreased by 1.0% per annum then the valuation of the liabilities is estimated to increase or decrease by approximately 0.4m 2006 07: 0.4m respectively.
Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes and post employment medical benefit scheme are as follows: Defined benefit Post retirement Total retirement schemes medical benefit scheme benefit schemes 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m m m Current service cost 9.7 18.6 9.7 18.6 Past service cost 0.1 0.1 Interest on obligation 42.3 39.7 0.2 0.2 42.5 39.9 Expected return on scheme assets 58.2 52.4 58.2 52.4 6.2 6.0 0.2 0.2 6.0 6.2 Curtailment gain due to business disposals 21.1 21.1 6.2 15.1 0.2 0.2 6.0 14.9 included within restructuring items The service cost for the period has been included within cost of sales 8.4m 2006 07: 15.6m, distribution costs 0.5m 2006 07: 1.5m and administrative expenses 0.8m 2006 07: 1.5m.
The interest on obligation and expected return on scheme assets is included within financing.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
In the prior period a curtailment gain of 2.1m arose on the sale of the trade and assets of NFT Distribution and a gain of 19.0m arose on the disposal of the trade and assets of the Speciality Bread, chilled Pastry, Cakes and Flour Milling businesses.
The curtailment gains were included in the profit or loss on disposal of the businesses.
A curtailment gain reflects reduced liabilities of the Scheme due to removing the salary link when formerly active members of the Scheme become deferred members.
Northern Foods plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements 95 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37 Retirement benefit obligations continued Special pension contributions of 22.0m were made to the Scheme during 2007 08 2006 07: 53.0m.

The overall expected rate of return is the weighted average of the returns above, allowing for anticipated balances held in each asset class according to the Schemes investment strategy.
The actual return on scheme assets was a loss of 16.0m 2006 07: gain 36.9m.
Work is currently at an advanced stage which is aimed at reducing future funding volatility of the Scheme.
As part of this, the Company and trustee have agreed a revised investment strategy for the Scheme to be implemented principally over the course of 2008 09.
Paragraph 106 of IAS19 requires the expected return on plan assets to be based on market expectations of returns over the entire life of the related obligation and as such the revised expected returns will be reflected from 30 March 2008 onwards.
The weighted average expected return of the revised investment strategy is 7.1% and this will be used to calculate the expected return on assets for 2008 09.
The history of experience adjustments is as follows: 2008 2007 2006 2005 m m m m Defined benefit schemes Present value of obligations 718.2 805.4 813.0 729.3 Fair value of scheme assets 784.2 801.5 727.8 562.9 Deficit in the scheme 66.0 3.9 85.2 166.4 Experience adjustments on scheme obligations: Amount loss gain 30.2 0.7 Percentage of scheme obligations 3.7% 0.1% Experience adjustments on scheme assets: Amount loss gain 74.2 15.5 99.6 14.2 Percentage of scheme obligations 9.5% 1.9% 13.7% 2.5% The cumulative effect of the experience adjustments on scheme liabilities as shown in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense is a gain of 29.5m 2006 07: gain of 29.5m.
The cumulative effect of the experience adjustments on scheme assets as shown in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense is a gain of 9.8m.
The Group expects to make ongoing contributions of approximately 8m to its defined benefit schemes in 2008 09.
Northern Foods plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements 97 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38 Events after the balance sheet date On 13 May 2008 the Group announced that following negotiations with a customer, and by mutual agreement, the Group has resigned supply of most of the product lines produced at the Fenland Foods ready meals facility, amounting to approximately 45m of annual revenue.
The site operated at break-even profitability in the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2008.
As a result of this the Group is in consultation with employees about proposals to mothball the site which at 29 March 2008 had a net book value of 24m.
The directors are currently unable to make a reliable estimate of the financial impact of mothballing the site.
This is a non-adjusting post balance sheet event.
The Group has also proposed a final dividend outlined in note 13 which is a non-adjusting post balance sheet event.
There have been no other post balance sheet events.
