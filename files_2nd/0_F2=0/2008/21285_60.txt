The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 47 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objectives as stated on the inside front cover and in the business review.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These financial risks: market risk comprising market price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit and counterparty risk, and the directors approach to the management of these risks, are set out below.
The Board of directors and the Manager coordinate the Companys risk management.
The Board determines the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to manage the risks and these are set out below under the relevant risk category.
The policies for the management of risk have not changed from the previous accounting period.
16.1 Market risk The fair value of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises market price risk see note 16.1.
2 and interest rate risk see note 16.1.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
1 Market price risk Market price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the fair value of the quoted and unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board of directors manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely reporting of relevant information from the Manager.
Investment performance is reviewed at each Board meeting.
The Board monitors the Managers compliance with the Companys objectives, and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation, including as between countries and economies.
The Companys exposure to changes in market prices at 31 October 2008 on its investments was as follows: 31 October 31 October 2008 2007 000 000 Equities 359,480 582,675 Fixed interest 16,036 49 375,516 582,724 48 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.1.
1 Market price risk continued Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the Companys net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2007: 20% in the fair values of the Companys equity investments at each balance sheet date.
This level of change is considered to be not unreasonable based on observation of current market conditions.

2 Currency risk A significant proportion of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and presentational currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a regular basis and reports to the Board at each Board meeting.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and total return of a movement in the exchange rate to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Borrowings may be used to limit the Companys exposure to future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
These borrowings are limited to 35% of the adjusted net asset value.
Investment income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company did not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 October are shown below.
The Companys equity investments which are denominated in a foreign currency, although not monetary items, have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the total profit after tax for the year and the net assets in regard to movements in the Companys foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities caused by changes in the exchange rates for the Sterling Euro, Sterling US Dollar and Sterling Japanese Yen.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: Sterling Euro - 10% 2007: 10%.
These percentages are deemed not unreasonable based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in recent years.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities held at each balance sheet date.

2 Currency risk continued The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of a depreciation in the year end exchange rate for Sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2008 2007 Euro US$ Yen Euro US$ Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 133 108 78 154 74 46 Capital return 3,114 9,018 4,703 7,193 8,900 5,806 Change to profit after tax for the year 3,247 9,126 4,781 7,347 8,974 5,852 Impact on net assets 3,247 9,126 4,781 7,347 8,974 5,852 The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of an appreciation in the year end exchange rate for Sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2008 2007 Euro US$ Yen Euro US$ Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 109 88 64 126 60 38 Capital return 2,548 7,379 3,848 5,885 7,282 4,750 Change to profit after tax for the year 2,657 7,467 3,912 6,011 7,342 4,788 Impact on net assets 2,657 7,467 3,912 6,011 7,342 4,788 In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of interest receivable from cash at bank and on deposit, and the value of the fixed interest investments.
Management of the risk The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 51 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.1.
3 Interest rate risk continued Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 October of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown below.
For floating interest rates exposure is by reference to when the interest rate is due to be re-set.
2008 2007 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash at bank 21,882 21,882 10,660 10,660 Investments 973 973 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Investments 15,063 15,063 4949 Debentures 25,000 25,000 25,000 25,000 The above year end amounts are not necessarily representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made, borrowings are drawn down and repaid.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2007: same.
Interest rate sensitivity The Company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its cash balances, and its fixed income investment portfolio.
The sensitivity of each exposure is as follows: Cash Cash balances vary throughout the year.
Cash balances at the year end were 21,882,000 and if that level of cash was maintained for a full year, then a 100 basis points change in LIBOR up or down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 219,000 2007: 107,000.
Fixed income investment sensitivity The Companys fixed income portfolio at the year end was valued at 16,036,000, and it had a modified duration interest rate sensitivity of approximately 5.9 years.
A 100 basis points change in short term interest rates up or down, which is mirrored by an equivalent change in long term interest rates, would be expected to decrease or increase this portfolios value by approximately 950,000, all other factors being equal.
16.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Company has a multi-currency loan facility of 30,000,000 with ING Bank NV 2007: 10,000,000 facility with ING Bank NV and 30,000,000 facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and an overdraft facility with the custodian, the extent of which is determined by the custodian on a regular basis by reference to the value of the securities held by it on behalf of the Company.
The facilities are subject to regular review.
The Company also has two debentures, details of which can be found in note 15 on page 46.
52 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.2 Liquidity risk continued The Board gives guidance to the Manager as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should generally remain fully invested and that short-term borrowings be used to manage short term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 October, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required was as follows: Due between Due more Due between Due more Due within 3 months than one Due within 3 months than one one month and one year year one month and one year year 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stocks 2,250 49,150 2,250 51,400 Other creditors and accruals 2,069 2,939 2,069 2,250 49,150 2,939 2,250 51,400 16.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk Credit risk is managed as follows: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of approved brokers, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings and is subject to continual review.
with regard to the corporate bonds in the portfolio, there is a credit risk that the borrowers do not repay principal or make interest payments.
This is managed through monitoring credit ratings and careful selection and is reviewed regularly.
Stock lending transactions are carried out with a number of approved counterparties, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be lent to any one counterparty.
Collateral details can be found in note 4.
None of the Companys financial assets or liabilities is secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
16.4 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments and derivatives or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank, bank overdrafts and amounts due under the multi-currency loan facility.
The par value of the debenture stocks can be found in note 15.
The fair values are calculated using prices quoted on the exchange on which the instruments trade.
