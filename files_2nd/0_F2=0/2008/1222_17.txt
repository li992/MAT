Furthermore, employee share ownership is encouraged and all employees are able to participate in one of the Groups schemes to encourage share ownership.
The Group has an informal and delegated organisational structure.
It does not presently operate any collective agreements with any trade unions.
Policy on payment of creditors The Groups policy is to pay suppliers before the end of the month following the month of receipt of the invoice, unless terms have been specifically agreed in advance.
This policy and any specific terms agreed with suppliers are made known to the appropriate staff and to suppliers on request.
Trade creditors of the Group at 31 December 2008 were equivalent to 25 days purchases for the Group 2007: ten days and nil days for the Company in both years.

Statement of directors responsibilities The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the directors remuneration report and the Group and the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and the parent company financial statements and the directors remuneration report in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
The Group and parent company financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to: Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: State that the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and with regard to the parent company financial statements, that applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and Prepare the Group and parent company financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business, in which case there should be supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are also required by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Services Authority to include a report containing a fair view of the business and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company and the Group.
These are set out in the financial review on pages 11 to 15.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the Group financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and the parent company financial statements and the directors remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
ARM Holdings plc 31 Directors report continued Directors statement pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency Rules Each of the directors whose names and functions are described in the biographies on pages 18 and 19 confirm that to the best of each persons knowledge and belief: The financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company and the Group: and The directors report and the financial review on pages 11 to 15 include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The directors are responsible for ensuring the maintenance and integrity of the Groups website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Disclosure of information to auditors In the case of each of the persons who are directors at the time when the report is approved, the following applies: So far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Groups auditors are unaware.
Each director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken in his or her duty as a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Groups auditors are aware of that information By order of the board Patricia Alsop, Company Secretary 32 ARM Holdings plc Remuneration report Remuneration committee The remuneration committee has responsibility for determining and agreeing with the board, within agreed terms of reference, the Groups policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and the individual remuneration packages for each executive director.
This includes basic salary, annual bonus, the level and terms of conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan and the terms of performance conditions that apply to such benefits, pension rights and any compensation payments.
Where the remuneration committee considers it appropriate, the committee will make recommendations in relation to the remuneration of senior management.
The committee also liaises with the board in relation to the preparation of the boards annual report to shareholders on the Groups policy on the remuneration of executive directors and in particular the directors remuneration report, as required by the Companies Act 1985, the Combined Code and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The committees terms of reference are published on the companys website at www.
The committee is chaired by Jeremy Scudamore and the other members are Kathleen ODonovan, Young Sohn and John Scarisbrick, who joined the committee in September 2008.
The committee met three times during 2008.
Given their diverse experience, these four independent non-executive directors are able to offer a balanced view and international expertise in relation to remuneration issues for the Group.
The committee has access to professional advice from external advisers generally appointed by the Executive Vice President, Human Resources in the furtherance of its duties and makes use of such advice.
During 2008, KPMG provided general advice on remuneration and benefits, including tax advice for employees who are seconded overseas and they also worked on royalty audits and the acquisition of Logipard AB.
Linklaters provided legal services in relation to equity plans and corporate matters.
Monks provided salary survey data.
Deloitte provided salary survey data, royalty audit services and tax training.
Kepler Associates provided independent verification of TSR calculations for the Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Executive Vice President, Human Resources also provided advice to the committee and to the Group.
Monks, which provided salary survey data, is an associate of the Groups external auditor and these services were approved by the audit committee in accordance with the procedure described in the corporate governance report.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, normally attend for part of remuneration committee meetings.
No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan for executive directors and senior managers and the Employee Equity Plan for all other employees were approved by shareholders at the 2006 AGM.
These plans brought the Groups remuneration structure more closely in line with UK market norms, increased alignment between remuneration and financial performance and strengthened the retention aspect of the deferred bonus.
Cessation of option grants to executive directors other than in exceptional circumstances and the reduction from three plans to two for executive directors and senior managers, together with the move away from options to shares for all employees, reduces potential dilution and has simplified remuneration arrangements.
Remuneration policy The remuneration committee, in its deliberations on remuneration policy for the Groups executive directors, seeks to give full consideration to the principles set out in the Combined Code.
The committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and corporate governance issues when setting the remuneration of executive directors.
The committee also monitors developments in accounting for equity-based remuneration on an ongoing basis.
The Group operates a remuneration policy and framework for executive directors designed to ensure that it attracts and retains the high quality management skills necessary to achieve a high level of corporate performance, in line with the best interests of shareholders.
This policy seeks to provide rewards and incentives for the remuneration of executive directors that reflect their performance and align with the objectives of the Group.
These comprise a mix of performancerelated and  remuneration.
The committee believes that a directors total remuneration should seek to recognise his worth in the external market and, to this end, operates a policy of paying base salaries which are in line with the market median, as part of a total remuneration package which is upper quartile.
The committee believes that this is justified, recognising that more than 50% of total potential remuneration is performance-related.
The committee obtains information about the external market from various independently published remuneration surveys and is committed to benchmarking the total remuneration package.
However for 2009, recognising current market conditions and the uncertainty over when the global economy will start to improve, the board took the decision to postpone the annual pay review across the Group and to review the situation at the mid year in the light of actual business performance and prospects for the remainder of the year and 2010.
This applies to all employees and to the board, including executive and non-executive directors.
The nature of the Groups development has meant that there has been a good deal of focus on the attainment of short-term objectives with a high level of variable remuneration.
Since 2007, variable remuneration has consisted of two performance-related elements: annual bonus and a conditional award under the Long Term Incentive Plan.
A shareholding guideline is in place for executive directors and certain senior managers, who are required to build up a holding of shares in the Company over a period of five years.
The shareholdings may be built up of shares received through earlier grants under the Companys share option schemes and or the Long Term Incentive Plan and or the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and, in the case of executive directors, the required holding is 100% of basic salary.
ARM Holdings plc 33 Remuneration report continued Incentive arrangements The remuneration committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group.
The various incentive schemes that comprise the remuneration packages of executive directors and senior managers are described below.
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan There is a strong variable element to executive directors remuneration and a bonus of up to 125% of base salary after application of a personal performance multiplier which flexes the payment by 0.75 to 1.25 can be earned through the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB if all targets are met.
The personal performance multiplier depends on the achievement of pre-determined objectives which are reviewed and approved by the committee each year.
These include key strategic objectives related to each directors role and responsibilities including compliance with the Management Charter which is designed to foster employee development, understanding of the overall vision and strategy of the Group and good governance.
There is compulsory deferral into shares of 50% of the bonus earned and an opportunity to earn an equity match of up to 2:1, subject to achievement of an EPS performance condition.
Deferred shares and any matching shares earned will normally be transferred three years from the date of award.
Payment of the bonus for 2008 was subject to the achievement of US dollar revenue and normalised operating profit targets set by the remuneration committee, which were directly related to the Groups financial results.
The bonuses payable to executive directors in respect of performance during 2008 are shown in the table on page 41 and are in the range 69.0% to 70.7% of base salary, 50% of which was compulsorily deferred into shares.
For 2008, 50% of bonus was dependent on achieving a US dollar revenue target and 50% on achieving a normalised operating profit target.
At EPS growth equal to the increase in the Consumer Prices Index CPI plus 4% per annum, the deferred shares will be matched on a 0.3:1 basis, rising to 2:1 when EPS growth is in excess of CPI plus 12% per annum.
The deferred shares can be forfeited in the event of gross misconduct and the matching shares are subject to forfeiture for bad leavers.
For 2009, 30% of bonus is dependent on achieving a US dollar revenue target and 70% on achieving a normalised operating profit target, which the committee believes have been set at challenging but motivational levels.
These targets are directly related to the Groups financial results and encourage achievement of the Groups short-term financial goals, while the deferral and matching elements encourage a longer term view of the success of the Group.
Maximum bonus is 125% of base salary depending on the personal performance multiplier described above.
Existing option schemes The grant of options under the existing share option schemes ceased in 2006 when the DAB and the Employee Equity Plan were approved by shareholders.
The Employee Equity Plan has the facility for option grants to be made, but this will be done only in exceptional circumstances.
The existing option grants to executive directors remain available for exercise and vesting in accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes.
In line with practice among the Groups peers in the technology sector, there are generally no performance conditions attached to the issue or exercise of discretionary options under the existing schemes, except for those issued to executive directors where performance conditions based on real EPS growth apply.
Share options issued to executive directors prior to their appointment to the board of the Group do not have performance conditions attached to them.
However, discretionary options issued to executive directors after their appointment to the board of the Group do have performance conditions attached to them.
These discretionary options will vest after seven years, but may vest after three years from grant to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied.
The performance conditions applicable to the Long Term Incentive Plan are described in more detail below and are based on TSR rather than EPS, providing the link to performance against an appropriate peer group.
These performance conditions were selected having regard to the position of the Group within its sector and the nature of the companies against which it competes to attract and retain high calibre employees.
The committee believes that the performance conditions represent the correct balance between being motivational and challenging.
Pensions The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a Group personal pension plan, which is a money purchase scheme.
For executive directors, the normal rate of Group contribution is 10% of the executives basic salary plus additional amounts in accordance with the Groups salary sacrifice scheme.
Full details of Group contributions are set out in the directors emoluments table on page 41.
Service agreements Executive directors have rolling service contracts that may be terminated by either party on one years notice.
These agreements provide for each of the directors to provide services to the Group on a full-time basis and contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months following termination of employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Groups customers, non-dealing with customers and non-solicitation of the Groups suppliers and employees.
In addition, each service contract contains an express obligation of confidentiality in respect of the Groups trade secrets and confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in the course of their employment.
34 ARM Holdings plc The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are as follows: Director Date Warren East 29 January 2001 Tim Score 1 March 2002 Tudor Brown 3 April 1996 Mike Inglis 17 July 2002 Mike Muller 31 January 1996 Simon Segars 4 January 2005 Where notice is served to terminate the appointment, whether by the Group or the executive director, the Group in its absolute discretion is entitled to terminate the appointment by paying to the executive director his salary in lieu of any required period of notice.
Non-executive directors During 2008, the Chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees and the senior independent director each received a total fee of 45,000 per annum and the other non-executive directors each received a total fee of 40,000 per annum.
These fees were arrived at by reference to fees paid by other companies of similar size and complexity, and reflected the amount of time non-executive directors were expected to devote to the Groups activities during the year, which is between 10 and 15 working days a year.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the executive directors and the term of appointment is three years.
Fees paid to non-executive directors are reviewed annually with effect from 1 January and, as mentioned above, the board agreed that, in the light of current market conditions, no increase should be paid at the start of 2009 and the situation will be reviewed at the mid year.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive arrangements and their service does not qualify for pension purposes or other benefits.
No element of their fees is performance-related.
Share options held by Lucio Lanza were granted prior to the Groups acquisition of Artisan.

In addition, the Index includes many companies that are currently the Groups customers, as well as companies which use ARM technology in their end products.

The performance conditions applicable to the 2006 conditional awards were satisfied to the extent of 38.9% plus dividend shares.

Conditional awards vest to the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year performance period from 1 January of the year of award and no re-testing thereafter is possible.
The performance conditions are based on the Companys TSR when measured against that of two comparator groups each testing half of the shares comprised in the award.

For each comparator group, the number of shares that may vest may be up to a maximum of 200% of relevant half of the shares comprised in the conditional award if the Companys TSR ranks in the upper decile, 50% will vest in the event of median performance and between median and upper decile performance vesting will increase on a straight-line basis.

1b Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the presentation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the EU, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
This is in accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation to fair value of available-for-sale investments: share-based payments: financial assets and liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through the income statement: and embedded derivatives.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of these financial statements requires the directors to make critical accounting estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
These estimates and judgements are summarised in note 1d.
48 ARM Holdings plc 1b Summary of significant accounting policies continued New standards, amendments and interpretations a Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2008 IFRIC 11, IFRS 2, Group and treasury share transactions This interpretation provides guidance on how share-based transactions involving treasury shares or options should be accounted for.
Published by the IASB in November 2006 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007, this interpretation was early adopted by the Group in 2007 but has no impact on the Groups financial statements.
b Standards and interpretations early adopted by the Group IFRS 8, Operating segments This supersedes IAS 14, Segmental reporting, under which segments were identified and reported on risk and return analysis.
Under IFRS 8, segments are reported based on internal reporting, bringing segment reporting in line with the requirements of US standard FAS 131.
Published by the IASB in November 2006, this standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 but was early adopted by the Group.
c Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2008 but not relevant IFRIC 12, Service concession arrangements This applies to contractual arrangements whereby a private sector operator participates in the development, financing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure for public sector services, for example, under private finance initiative contracts PFI contracts.
It is not relevant for the Group.
Published by the IASB November 2006, it is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008. d Standards, amendments and interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted Amendment to IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, and IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures on the Reclassification of financial assets.
This amendment allows the reclassification of certain financial assets previously classified as held-for-trading or available-for-sale to another category under limited circumstances.
Published in November 2008, this amendment is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008.
This is not expected to have a material impact on the Group since it does not have significant assets of this type.
Amendment to IAS 32, Financial instruments: Presentation, and IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements on Puttable financial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation This amendment ensures entities classify Puttable financial instruments and other financial instruments as equity, provided they have particular features and meet specific conditions.
Published by the IASB in February 2008 this amendment is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This is not relevant to the Group as it does not currently enter into these types of transactions.
Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based payments This clarifies what events constitute vesting conditions and also specifies that all cancellations, whether by the Group or by another party, should receive the same accounting treatment.
This is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements as it does not have a significant number of the types of options affected.
Published by the IASB in January 2008, this amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IAS 1 revised, Presentation of financial statements This revised standard requires entities to prepare a statement of comprehensive income.
All non-owner changes in equity are required to be shown in a performance statement, but entities can choose whether to present one performance statement the statement of comprehensive income or two statements the income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
Owner changes in equity are shown in a statement of changes in equity.
Also entities making restatements or reclassifications of comparative information are required to present a restated balance sheet as at the beginning of the comparative period in addition to the current requirement to present balance sheets at the end of the current period and comparative period.
Published by the IASB in September 2007 this revised standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This will not have a material impact the Groups financial statements since only the disclosure of the statements will be affected.
IFRS 3, Revised, Business combinations This is equivalent to FAS 141R issued by the FASB in December 2007.
The revision to this standard changes accounting for business combinations.
While the acquisition method is still applied, there are significant changes to the treatment of contingent payments, transaction costs and the calculation of goodwill.
Published by the IASB in January 2008, the standard is applicable to business combinations occurring in accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, with earlier application permitted.
This could impact the Groups financial statements in future if it makes further acquisitions.
Amendment to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement on Eligible hedged items.
This amendment makes two significant changes.
It prohibits designating inflation as a hedgeable component of a fixed rate debt.
It also prohibits including time value in the one-sided hedged risk when designating options as hedges.
Published by the IASB in July 2008 it is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and must be applied retrospectively.
This is not expected to impact the Group since it does not currently designate any financial instruments as hedges.
ARM Holdings plc 49 Notes to the financial statements continued 1b Summary of significant accounting policies continued New standards, amendments and interpretations continued IAS 23 Amendment, Borrowing costs A result of the joint short-term convergence project with the FASB, this new standard requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset.
The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs has been removed.
This will not be relevant to the Group because the Group currently does not fund acquisitions of assets with debt.
Published by the IASB in March 2007, this is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IAS 27 Revised, Consolidated and separate financial statements This amendment revises the accounting for transactions with non-controlling interests.
Published by the IASB in January 2008, this is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
This is not relevant to the Group as it does not have any non-controlling interests.
IFRS 7 Revised, Financial instruments: Disclosures This amendment forms part of the IASBs response to the financial crisis and addresses the G20 conclusions aimed at improving transparency and enhancing accounting guidance.
The amendment increases the disclosure requirements about fair value measurement and reinforces existing principles for disclosure about liquidity risk.
The amendment introduces a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurement disclosure and requires some specific quantitative disclosures for financial instruments in the lowest level in the hierarchy.
In addition, the amendment clarifies and enhances existing requirements for the disclosure of liquidity risk primarily requiring a separate liquidity risk analysis for derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities.
Published by the IASB in March 2009 this amendment is effective for periods starting on or after 1 January 2009 with no comparatives for the first year of application.
This will only affect presentation and the potential impact of this on the Groups financial statements has not yet been assessed.
IFRIC 13, Customer loyalty programmes relating to IAS 18, Revenue This provides guidance on accounting for customer loyalty programmes.
As the Group does not offer such incentives, it will not be relevant.
Published by the IASB in June 2007, it is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008.
IFRIC 14, IAS 19, The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction This provides guidance on accounting for defined benefit pension schemes.
The Group does not have any such schemes and therefore it will not be relevant.
Published by the IASB in July 2007, it is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IFRIC 15, Agreements for construction of real estates This clarifies which standard IAS 18, Revenue, or IAS 11, Construction contracts should be applied to particular transactions and is likely to mean that IAS 18 will be applied to a wider range of transactions.
This is not relevant to the Group as it does not have any transactions involving real estate.
Published by the IASB in July 2008, it is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IFRIC 16, Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation This clarifies the usage and requirements of IAS 21 with respect to net investment hedging.
This is not relevant to the Group as it does not undertake such activities.
Published by the IASB in July 2008, it is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008.
IFRIC 17, Distributions of non-cash assets to owners This clarifies how an entity should measure distributions of assets, other than cash, when it pays dividends to its owners.
This is not relevant to the Group as it does not make any distributions of assets to its owners, other than cash.
Published by the IASB in November 2008 it is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
IFRIC 18, Transfer of assets from customers This clarifies the accounting for arrangements where an item of property, plant and equipment, which is provided by the customer, is used to provide an ongoing service.
This is not relevant to the Group as it does not engage in such activities.
Published by the IASB in January 2009, it is effective for transfers of assets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009.
Other than the potential impact of the revision to IFRS 3, the directors expect that the adoption of these standards, annual improvements and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements when they come into effect for periods after 1 January 2009.
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on consolidation.
All subsidiaries use uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events and similar circumstances.
Business combinations The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are included in the income statement from the date they are acquired.
On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Revisions were made in 2008 to goodwill recognised on acquisitions from earlier years, relating predominantly to contingent consideration adjustments see note 16.
50 ARM Holdings plc 1b Summary of significant accounting policies continued Segment reporting At 31 December 2008, the Group is organised on a world-wide basis into three business segments, namely the Processor Division PD, the Physical IP Division PIPD and the Systems Design Division SDD.
This is based upon the Groups internal organisation and management structure and is the primary way in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM and the rest of the board are provided with financial information.
Segment expenses are expenses that are directly attributable to a segment together with the relevant portion of other expenses that can reasonably be allocated to the segment.
Foreign exchange gains or losses, gains or losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments, investment income, interest payable and tax are not allocated by segment.
Segment assets and liabilities include items that are directly attributable to a segment plus an allocation on a reasonable basis of shared items.
Corporate assets and liabilities are not included in business segments and are thus unallocated.
At 31 December 2008 and 2007, these comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term marketable securities, tax-related and other assets and the fair value of currency exchange contracts.
Any current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are also not included in business segments and are thus unallocated.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency The functional currency of each Group entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the presentation currency of the Group.
b Transactions and balances Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into the functional currency of each Group entity at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Such exchange differences have been included in general and administrative expenses.
c Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy not based in the UK are translated into sterling as follows: i Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date: ii Income and expenses for each income statement presented are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the time of each transaction during the period: and iii All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity, being taken directly to equity via the cumulative translation adjustment.
When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recognised in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets such as trading and available-for-sale securities is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined using valuation techniques.
The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of foreign currency options is based upon valuations performed by an independent bank as well as managements view of market conditions.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values as this is the amount which would be receivable payable if the assets liabilities had crystallised at the balance sheet date.
Any current tax liabilities are not included in this category.
Revenue recognition The Group follows the principles of IAS 18, Revenue recognition, in determining appropriate revenue recognition policies.
In principle, therefore, revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts, and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue comprises the value of sales of licences to ARM technology, royalties arising from the resulting sale of licensees ARM technology-based products, revenues from support, maintenance and training, consulting contracts and the sale of development boards and software toolkits.
ARM Holdings plc 51 Notes to the financial statements continued 1b Summary of significant accounting policies continued Revenue recognition continued Revenue from standard licence products which are not modified to meet the specific requirements of each customer is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the product are transferred to the customer.
Many licence agreements are for products which are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer.
Revenue from the sale of such licences is recognised on a  basis over the period from signing of the licence to customer acceptance.
Under the  method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognised in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined.
The  is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated project requirement, which approximates to the extent of performance.
Where invoicing milestones on licence arrangements are such that the receipts fall due significantly outside the period over which the customisation is expected to be performed or significantly outside its normal payment terms for standard licence arrangements, the Group evaluates whether it is probable that economic benefits associated with these milestones will flow to the Group and therefore whether these receipts should initially be included in the arrangement consideration.
In particular, it considers: Whether there is sufficient certainty that the invoice will be raised in the expected timeframe, particularly where the invoicing milestone is in some way dependent on customer activity: Whether it has sufficient evidence that the customer considers that the Groups contractual obligations have been, or will be, fulfilled: Whether there is sufficient certainty that only those costs budgeted to be incurred will indeed be incurred before the customer will accept that a future invoice may be raised: and The extent to which previous experience with similar product groups and similar customers support the conclusions reached.
Where the Group considers that there is insufficient evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with such future milestones will flow to the Group, taking into account these criteria, such milestones are excluded from the arrangement consideration until there is sufficient evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
The Group does not discount future invoicing milestones, as the effect of so doing would be immaterial.
Where agreements involve several components, the entire fee from such arrangements is allocated to each of the individual components based on each components fair value, where fair value is the price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately.
Where a component in a multiple-component agreement has not previously been sold separately, the assessment of fair value for that component is based on other factors, including, but not limited to, the price charged when it was sold alongside other items and the book price of the component relative to the book prices of the other components in the agreement.
If fair value of one or more components in a multiple-component agreement is not determinable, the entire arrangement fee is deferred until such fair value is determinable, or the component has been delivered to the licensee.
Where, in substance, two elements of a contract are linked and fair values cannot be allocated to the individual components, the revenue recognition criteria are applied to the elements as if they were a single element.
Agreements including rights to unspecified future products as opposed to unspecified upgrades and enhancements are accounted for using subscription accounting, with revenue from the arrangement being recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered if no term is specified, beginning with the delivery of the first product.
Certain products have been co-developed by the Group and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licences to the product.
In those cases where the Group makes sales of these products and is exposed to the significant risks and benefits associated with the transaction, the total value of the licence is recorded as revenue and the amount payable to the collaborative partner is recorded as cost of sales.
Where the collaborative partner makes sales of these products, the Group records as revenue the commission it is due when informed by the collaborative partner that a sale has been made.
In addition to the licence fees, contracts generally contain an agreement to provide post-delivery service support, in the form of support, maintenance and training which consists of the right to receive services and or unspecified product upgrades or enhancements that are offered on a  basis.
Fees for post-delivery service support are generally specified in the contract.
Revenue related to post-delivery service support is recognised based on fair value, which is determined with reference to contractual renewal rates.
If no renewal rates are specified, the entire fee under the transaction is amortised and recognised on a straight-line basis over the contractual post-delivery service support period.
Where renewal rates are specified, revenue for post-delivery service support is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by the Group with the licensee.
If the amount of revenue recognised exceeds the amounts invoiced to customers, the excess amount is recorded as amounts recoverable on contracts within accounts receivable.
The excess of licence fees and post-delivery service support invoiced over revenue recognised is recorded as deferred revenue.
52 ARM Holdings plc 1b Summary of significant accounting policies continued Revenue recognition continued Sales of software, including development systems, which are not specifically designed for a given licence such as off-theshelf software are recognised upon delivery, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
At that time, the Group has no further obligations except that, where necessary, the costs associated with providing post-delivery service support have been accrued.
Services such as training that the Group provides which are not essential to the functionality of the IP are separately stated and priced in the contract and, therefore, accounted for separately.
Revenue is recognised as services are performed and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Groups customers of products containing ARM technology.
Royalty revenues are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue from consulting is recognised when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled.
For larger consulting projects containing several project milestones, revenue is recognised on a  basis described above.
Consulting costs are recognised when incurred.
As disclosed above, in accordance with IAS 8, Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, the Group makes significant estimates in applying its revenue recognition policies.
In particular, as discussed in detail above, estimates are made in relation to the use of the  accounting method, which requires that the extent of progress toward completion of contracts may be anticipated with reasonable certainty.
The use of the  method is itself based on the assumption that, at the outset of licence agreements, there is an insignificant risk that customer acceptance is not obtained.
The Group also makes assessments, based on prior experience, of the extent to which future milestone receipts represent a probable future economic benefit to the Group.
In addition, when allocating revenue to various components of arrangements involving several components, it is assumed that the fair value of each element is reflected by its price when sold separately.
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the revenue recognition policies affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
If different assumptions were used, it is possible that different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Research and development expenditure All ongoing research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Where a product is technically feasible, production and sale are intended, a market exists, expenditure can be measured reliably, and sufficient resources are available to complete the project, development costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective product.
The Group believes its current process for developing products is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility which is evidenced by a working model.
Accordingly, development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant and, therefore, no costs have been capitalised to date.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Any collaborative agreement whereby a third party agrees to partially fund the Groups research and development is recognised over the period of the agreement as a credit within research and development costs.
Government grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are credited to research and development costs within the income statement to match the projects related expenditure.
Retirement benefit costs The Group contributes to defined contribution plans substantially covering all employees in Europe and the US and to government pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China, Israel and India.
The Group contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages of employee compensation, and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if payments are not made on such a basis.
Investment income Investment income relates to interest income, which is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
ARM Holdings plc 53 Notes to the financial statements continued 1b Summary of significant accounting policies continued Dividends Distributions to equity holders are not recognised in the income statement under IFRS, but are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders equity.
A liability is recorded for a dividend when the dividend is approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised as a distribution when paid.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding treasury stock and those shares held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP, both of which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The diluted share base for the year ended 31 December 2008 excludes incremental shares of approximately 38,822,000 2007: 8,786,000 related to employee share options.
These shares are excluded due to their anti-dilutive effect as a result of the exercise price of these shares being higher than the market price.
Property, plant and equipment The cost of property, plant and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
External costs and internal costs are capitalised to the extent they enhance the future economic benefit of the asset.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less their estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter Computers Three to five years Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of property, plant and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Asset lives and residual values are reviewed on an annual basis.
Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the assets, including any intangible assets identified and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised but is measured at cost less impairment losses.
In determining the fair value of consideration, the fair value of equity issued is the market value of equity at the date of completion, the fair value of share options assumed is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and the fair value of contingent consideration is based upon whether the directors believe any performance conditions will be met and thus whether any further consideration will be payable.
b Other intangible assets Computer software, purchased patents and licences to use technology are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from them, which is typically three to ten years.
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of new business application software and which are incurred during the period prior to the date that the software is placed into operational use, are capitalised.
Although an independent valuation is made of any intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination, the directors are primarily responsible for determining the fair value of intangible assets.
Developed technology, existing agreements and customer relationships, core technology, trademarks and tradenames, and order backlog are capitalised and amortised over a period of one to six years, being a prudent estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from them.
In-process research and development projects purchased as part of a business combination may meet the criteria set out in IFRS 3, Business combinations, for recognition as intangible assets other than goodwill.
The directors track the status of in-process research and development intangible assets such that their amortisation commences when the assets are brought into use.
This typically means a write off period of one to five years.
54 ARM Holdings plc 1b Summary of significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets continued Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of intangible assets, less their estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Computer software Three to five years Patents and licences Three to ten years In-process research and development One to five years Developed technology One to five years Existing agreements and customer relationships Two to ten years Core technology Five years Trademarks and tradenames Four to five years Order backlog One year Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
The annual impairment tests in 2007 and 2008 showed there was no impairment with respect to goodwill.
Furthermore, no trigger events have been identified that would suggest the impairment of any of the Groups other intangible assets.
Financial assets The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
a Financial assets at fair value through the income statement Financial assets at fair value through the income statement are financial assets held for trading that is, assets that have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
They are initially recognised at fair value with transaction costs being expensed in the income statement.
Specifically, the Groups currency exchange contracts and embedded derivatives fall within this category.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through the income statement are presented in the income statement within general and administrative expenses in the period in which they arise.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
Accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents are classified as Loans and receivables in the balance sheet.
c Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Publicly-traded investments are classified as available-for-sale.
Initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs on the trade date, they are revalued at market value at each period end.
Unrealised holding gains or losses on such securities are included, net of related taxes, directly in equity via a revaluation reserve except where there is evidence of permanent impairment see below.
Equity securities that are not publicly traded are also classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value plus transaction costs at the trade date.
Given the markets for these assets are not active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
At 31 December 2008 and 2007, the estimated fair value of these investments approximated to cost less any permanent diminution in value, based on estimates determined by the directors.
ARM Holdings plc 55 Notes to the financial statements continued 1b Summary of significant accounting policies continued Financial assets continued Impairment of financial assets The Group considers at each reporting date whether there is any indication that any financial asset is impaired.
If there is such an indication, the Group carries out an impairment test by measuring the assets recoverable amount, which is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognised, and the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are permanently impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any permanent impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or permanently impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are recycled through the income statement.
Impairment testing of trade receivables is described under Accounts receivable below.
Derivative financial instruments The Group utilises currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk on actual transactions related to accounts receivable, denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business.
The Groups currency exchange contracts do not subject the Group to risk from exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains, respectively, on the transactions being hedged.
The currency exchange contracts and related accounts receivable are recorded at fair value at each period end.
Fair value is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
All recognised gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the contracts are recorded within general and administrative expenses in the income statement.
The Group does not enter into currency exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging anticipated transactions.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Short-term investments and short-term marketable securities The Group considers all highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of greater than three months but less than one year to be either short-term investments or short-term marketable securities.
Any investments with a maturity date of greater than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term.
Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Accounts receivable are first assessed individually for impairment.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments more than 90 days overdue are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Where there is no objective evidence of impairment for an individual receivable, it is included in a group of receivables with similar credit risk characteristics and these are collectively assessed for impairment.
In the case of impairment, the carrying amount of the asset s is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within general and administrative costs.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against general and administrative costs in the income statement.
56 ARM Holdings plc 1b Summary of significant accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In general, cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis and includes transport and handling costs.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Accounts payable Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Income taxes The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Groups subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the temporary differences will be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising in the same tax jurisdiction are offset.
In the UK and the US, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts treated as compensation on exercise of certain employee share options under each jurisdictions tax rules.
As explained under Share-based payments below, a compensation expense is recorded in the Groups income statement over the period from the grant date to the vesting date of the relevant options.
As there is a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset is recorded.
The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future based on the Companys share price at the balance sheet date with the cumulative amount of the compensation expense recorded in the income statement.
If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings.
As explained under Share-based payments below, no compensation charge is recorded in respect of options granted before 7 November 2002 or in respect of those options which have been exercised or have lapsed before 1 January 2005.
Nevertheless, tax deductions have arisen and will continue to arise on these options.
The tax effects arising in relation to these options are recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings.
Provisions Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount of the outflow can be reliably estimated.
Embedded derivatives In accordance with IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, the Group has reviewed all its contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard.
From time to time, the Group may enter into contracts denominated in a currency typically US dollars that is neither the functional currency of the group entity nor the functional currency of the customer or the collaborative partner.
Where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, the Group carries such derivatives at fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement under general and administrative expenses, as shown below: 2008 2007 000 000 Gain in income statement 12,518 1,400 ARM Holdings plc 57 Notes to the financial statements continued 1b Summary of significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
In accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payments, equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The Group operates Save As You Earn SAYE schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP in the US.
Options under the SAYE schemes are granted at a 20% discount to market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant and at a 15% discount to the lower of the market prices at the beginning and end of the scheme for the ESPP.
The UK SAYE schemes are approved by the UK tax authorities, which stipulates that the saving period must be at least 36 months.
The Group has recognised a compensation charge in respect of the SAYE plans and US ESPPs.
The charges for these are calculated as detailed above.
The Group also has a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP on which it is also required to recognise a compensation charge under IFRS 2, calculated as detailed above.
The Group has applied the exemption available, and has applied the provisions of IFRS 2 only to those options granted after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 31 December 2004.
The share-based payments charge is allocated to cost of sales, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses on the basis of headcount.
Employers taxes on share options Employers National Insurance in the UK and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of certain share options.
In accordance with IFRS 2, this is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
A provision is made, calculated using the intrinsic value of the relevant options at the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the vesting period of the options.
Employee share ownership plans The Groups Employee Benefit Trust the Trust was set up on 16 April 1998 to administer the Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP.
The Trust is funded by loans from the Group, with its assets comprising shares in the Company.
The Group recognises the assets and liabilities of the Trust in its own accounts and the carrying value of the Companys shares held by the Trust are recorded as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees.
All shares held within the Trust were awarded during 2008 and it is now in the process of being wound up.
Treasury shares Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to equity holders of the Company.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
58 ARM Holdings plc 1c Financial risk management The Group operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor industry which has been characterised by price erosion, rapid technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition.
Significant technological changes in the industry could affect operating results.
The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include currency risk, interest rate risk, price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Given the size of the Group, the directors have not delegated the responsibility for monitoring financial risk management to a sub-committee of the board.
The policies set by the board of directors are implemented by the Groups finance department.
The Group has a treasury policy that sets out specific guidelines to manage currency risk, interest rate risk, securities price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk and also sets out circumstances where it would be appropriate to use financial instruments to manage these.
Currency risk The Groups earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally in respect of the US dollar, reflecting the fact that most of its revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars, while a significant proportion of its costs are settled in sterling.
The Group seeks to use currency exchange contracts and currency options to manage the US dollar sterling risk as appropriate, by monitoring the timing and value of anticipated US dollar receipts which tend to arise from low-volume, high-value licence deals and royalty receipts in comparison with its requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars.
The Group reviews the resulting exposure on a regular basis and hedges this exposure using currency exchange contracts and currency options for the sale of US dollars as appropriate.
Such contracts are entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with projected US dollar cash receipts.
The Group is also exposed to currency risk in respect of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of its overseas subsidiaries.
At present, the Group does not mitigate this risk, for example by using foreign currency intra-group loans, as it has currently no requirement for external borrowings.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $100 million 2007: $34 million for sterling.
In addition, the Group utilises option instruments which have various provisions that, depending on the spot rate at maturity, give either the Group or the counterparty the option to exercise.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had outstanding currency options under which the Group may, under certain circumstances, be required to sell up to $144 million 2007: $145 million for sterling.
A common scenario with options of this type is that the spot price at expiry is such that neither the Group nor the counterparty chooses to exercise the option.
The Group had $86 million 2007: $88 million of accounts receivable denominated in US dollars at that date, and US dollar cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term marketable securities balances of $61 million 2007: $78 million.
Thus the Groups currency exchange contracts and currency options at the year-end potentially exceeded its US dollar current assets.
This is because the Group has taken longer term positions through its currency exchange contracts in recent years given the predictable nature of the Groups cash flows.
The Group does not qualify for hedge accounting, and all movements in the fair value of derivative foreign exchange instruments are recorded in the income statement, offsetting the foreign exchange movements on the accounts receivable, cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term marketable securities balances being hedged.
In addition, certain customers remit royalties and licence fees in other currencies, primarily the euro.
The Group is also required to settle certain expenses in euros, primarily in its French, Belgian and German subsidiaries, and as the net amounts involved are not considered significant, the Group does not take out euro currency exchange contracts.
As at 31 December 2008, if sterling had weakened by 10% against foreign currencies with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 4.2 million lower 2007: sterling strengthened by 10%, post taxprofit lower by 5.6 million, mainly as a result of the mix of financial instruments at respective year-ends.
Equity would have been 62.1 million higher with sterling 10% weaker 2007: 48.9 million lower with sterling 10% stronger mainly due to the increase in value of US dollar denominated goodwill and intangibles.
Interest rate risk At 31 December 2008, the Group had 79 million 2007: 54 million of interest-bearing assets.
At 31 December 2008, 38% 2007: 79% of interest-bearing assets, comprising cash equivalents: short-term investments: short-term marketable securities: and the Groups long-term investment in W&W Communications Inc. see note 14 in 2007, are at fixed rates and are therefore exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on relevant national LIBID equivalents and is therefore exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
The proportion of funds held in fixed rather than floating rate deposits is determined in accordance with the policy outlined under Liquidity risk below.
Other financial assets, such as available-for-sale investments, are not directly exposed to interest rate risk.
Had interest rates been 1% lower throughout the year, interest receivable would have reduced by approximately 0.6 million 2007: 1.0 million and profit after tax by 0.4 million 2007: 0.7 million.
The Group had no borrowings during 2008.
ARM Holdings plc 59 Notes to the financial statements continued 1c Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk continued The Group has no derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate fluctuations in place at the year-end since it has no loan financing, and as such no hedge accounting is applied.
The Groups cash flow is carefully monitored on a daily basis.
Excess cash, considering expected future cash flows, is placed on either short-term or medium-term deposit to maximise the interest income thereon.
Daily surpluses are swept into higher-interest earning accounts overnight.
Securities price risk The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk on available-for-sale investments.
As there can be no guarantee that there will be a future market for securities which are generally unlisted at the time of investment or that the value of such investments will rise, the directors evaluate each investment opportunity on its merits before committing ARMs funds.
The board of directors reviews holdings in such companies on a regular basis to determine whether continued investment is in the best interests of the Group.
Funds for such ventures are limited in order that the financial effect of any potential decline of the value of investments will not be substantial in the context of the Groups financial results.
i Listed investments At the year end, the Group had no listed investments.
At 31 December 2007, the Groups only listed investment was a minority stake in Superscape Group plc Superscape, the carrying value of which at 31 December 2007 was 1.2 million.
A 10% decrease in Superscapes share price as at 31 December 2007 from 7.98 pence to 7.18 pence would have reduced the Groups post-tax profit by nil and resulted in a 0.1 million charge to other components of equity on the basis that such a reduction in value would have been deemed temporary.
Superscape was acquired by Glu Mobile Inc. during 2008 for 10 pence per share, this being the value that the Group had permanently impaired its investment to as at 31 December 2007. ii Unlisted investments The Group has unlisted investments with a carrying value as at 31 December 2008 of 1.2 million 2007: 3.7 million.
A permanent 10% fall in the underlying value of these companies as at 31 December 2008 would therefore have reduced the Groups post-tax profit by 0.1 million 2007: 0.4 million and resulted in a nil 2007: nil reduction in other components of equity.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
As at 31 December 2008, the Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit, which is reassessed annually by the board of directors.
Financial instrument counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the board of directors and such approval is limited to financial institutions with at least an AA rating, or in the case of UK building societies had over 1 billion in assets, except in certain jurisdictions where the cash holding concerned is immaterial.
At 31 December 2007 and 2008, the majority of the Groups cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities were deposited with major clearing banks and building societies in the UK and US in the form of money market deposits and corporate bonds for varying periods up to two years.
Over 90% of the Groups cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term marketable securities were held with global financial institutions with at least an AA rating, or in the case of UK building societies had over 1 billion in assets, as at 31 December 2008 and 2007.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
The Group generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable, as many of its customers are large, well-established companies.
The Group has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.
The Group markets and sells to a relatively small number of customers with individually large value transactions.
At 31 December 2008, one 2007: nil customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable.
This customer was one of a group of large, established semiconductor companies that accounted for over 80% of the year-end accounts receivable balance, where the risk of default on monies owed is deemed negligible.
All monies owed from this customer in respect of the amounts due at 31 December 2008 have been paid after the year-end.
The Group performs credit checks on all customers other than those paying in advance in order to assess their creditworthiness and ability to pay its invoices as they become due.
As such, the balance of accounts receivable not owed by the large semiconductor companies is still deemed by management to be of low risk of default due to the nature of the checks performed on them, and accordingly a relatively small allowance against these receivables is in place to cover this low risk of default.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
60 ARM Holdings plc 1c Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term marketable securities, such that highly liquid resources exceed the Groups projected cash outflows at all times.
Surplus funds are placed on fixedor floating-rate deposits depending on the prevailing economic climate at the time with reference to forward interest rates and also on the required maturity of the deposit as driven by the expected timing of the Groups cash receipts and payments over the shortto medium-term.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve comprising an undrawn borrowing facility, and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flow.
This is carried out at both a local and a Group level although only the parent company has access to the borrowing facility.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

The capital structure of the Group consists of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities and capital and reserves attributable to equity holders of the Company, as disclosed in note 20 and the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, sell assets to raise cash or take on debt.
Between 2004 and 2007, the Groups strategy was to increase its balance sheet efficiency by reducing its cash balance via returning cash to shareholders through a progressive dividend policy and a rolling share buyback programme.
Whilst the Group intends to further increase balance sheet efficiency over time, in 2008, recognising the uncertain macroeconomic environment, the net cash balance was increased from 51.3 million at the start of the year to 78.8 million at the year-end.
Notwithstanding this, the share buyback programme continued during the year and the dividend was increased by 10%.
The capital structure is continually monitored by the Group.
ARM Holdings plc 61 Notes to the financial statements continued 1c Financial risk management continued Capital risk management continued During the year, the Group entered into a 50 million revolving credit facility providing the Group access to funds for any corporate purpose.
The Group did not drawdown on this facility or the previous 100 million facility at any time during the year, and the facility was undrawn at the balance sheet date.
Any drawn amounts accrue interest at a LIBOR-plus rate whilst there is a nominal charge for the undrawn portion.
Furthermore, the facility requires the Group to adhere to various financial covenants relating to EBITDA multiples and interest cover: the Group adhered to all covenants during the year.
Fair value of currency exchange contracts The fair value of currency exchange contracts is estimated using the settlement rates.
The estimation of the fair value of the liability in respect of currency exchange contracts is 18,457,000 at 31 December 2008 2007: 496,000.
The increase in 2008 is due to the mix of contracts, settlement rates and currency volatility but predominantly due to the significant strengthening of the US dollar during the second half of 2008, resulting in the year-end USD GBP spot rate being lower than the majority of settlement rates.
The resulting loss on the movement of the fair value of currency exchange contracts is recognised in the income statement under general and administrative expenses, as shown below: 2008 2007 000 000 Loss in income statement 17,961 935 1d Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the directors to make critical accounting estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
These estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experiences and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill The Group tests goodwill for impairment at least annually.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.
As discussed in detail in note 16, estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGUs and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present values of those cash flows.
Revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of licence agreements which are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer is recognised on a  method basis.
Use of this method requires the directors to estimate the total project resource requirement and also any losses on uncompleted contracts.
Provisions for income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Provision for impairment of trade receivables The Group assesses trade receivables for impairment which requires the directors to estimate the likelihood of payment forfeiture by customers.
Legal settlements and other contingencies Determining the amount to be accrued for legal settlement requires the directors to estimate the committed future legal and settlement fees the Group is expecting to incur.
Where suits are filed against the Group for infringement of patents, the directors assess the extent of any potential infringement based on legal advice and written opinions received from external counsel and then estimate the level of accrual required.
Contingent consideration for an acquisition is recognised as part of the purchase consideration if the contingent conditions are expected to be satisfied.
This requires the directors to estimate the acquirees future financial performance, typically more than one year post-acquisition.
62 ARM Holdings plc 2 Segmental reporting At 31 December 2008 the Group is organised on a world-wide basis into three main business segments: Processor Division PD, encompassing those resources that are centred around microprocessor cores, including specific functions such as graphics IP, fabric IP, embedded software and configurable digital signal processing IP.
Physical IP Division PIPD, concerned with the building blocks necessary for translation of a circuit design into actual silicon.
Systems Design Division SDD, focused on the tools and models used to create and debug software and system-on-chip SoC designs.
This is based upon the Groups internal organisation and management structure and is the primary way in which the board of directors is provided with financial information.
Whilst revenues are reported into four main revenue streams namely licensing, royalties, development systems and services, the costs, operating results and balance sheets are only analysed into these three divisions.
In 2007, the Group early-adopted IFRS 8, Operating segments.
This supersedes IAS 14, Segmental reporting, under which segments were identified and reported on risk and return analyses.
For the Group, the impact of this is purely presentational as under IAS 14, the Groups business segments were still defined as PD, PIPD and SDD.
The acquisition of Logipard in 2008 was allocated to PD, together with the related goodwill.
The following analysis is of revenues: operating costs: investment income: interest payable: profit loss before tax, tax: profit loss after tax: depreciation: amortisation of other intangible assets: share-based payment costs: capital expenditure: total assets and liabilities: net assets and goodwill for each segment and the Group in total.
Unallocated operating costs are foreign exchange revaluation on monetary items, including cash and cash equivalents.
Unallocated assets and liabilities include: cash and cash equivalents: short-term investments and marketable securities: some deferred tax balances: current tax and VAT.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, including additions resulting from acquisitions through business combinations.
The results of each segment have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with those of the Group as a whole.
Geographical information The Group manages its business segments on a global basis.
The operations are based in three main geographical areas.
The UK is the home country of the parent.
