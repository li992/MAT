Financial Performance FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 19.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Own shares held through an ESOP trust are recorded at cost, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, and are deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are transferred to employees or sold.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Contracts entered into with a third party to buy back the Companys shares during a close period give rise to an obligation for the Group.
This obligation is included in trade and other payables and deducted from equity on the balance sheet for the value of the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the contract with the third party.
If the number of shares repurchased by the third party is not the maximum then there is a reversal through equity for that amount.
Any changes in the share price from the date of the contract are taken through the income statement.
All issued shares are fully paid.
