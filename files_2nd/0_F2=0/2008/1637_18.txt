44 45 Notes to the financial statements IFRS 1 Corporate information AVEVA Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered ofce is given on page 24.
AVEVA Group plcs shares are publicly traded on the Ofcial List of the London Stock Exchange.
2 Basis of preparation The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008.
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The Group presents adjusted profit before tax on the face of the Consolidated income statement disclosing those material items of operating income and expense which materially impact the underlying performance of the business.
The Directors believe that adjusted profit before tax allows shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods in assessing trends in financial performance.
a Statement of compliance The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2008.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and are included at pages 74 to 78. b Basis of consolidation The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using existing GAAP for each country of operation.
Adjustments are made to translate any differences that may exist between the respective local GAAPs and IFRS.
Inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
On acquisition, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, with any excess of the cost of acquisition over this value being capitalised as goodwill.
3 significant accounting estimates The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: a Impairment of goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash ows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash ows.
The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 March 2008 was 16,689,000 2007 15,062,000. b Dened benefit pension schemes The determination of the Groups obligations and expense for dened benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts.
The assumptions applied are described in note 25 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates.
While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the amount of the Groups future pension obligations, actuarial gains and losses included in the Statement of recognised income and expense in future years and the future staff costs.
The carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2008 was 1,592,000 2007 4,943,000. c Impairment of trade receivables The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates their fair value.
A provision has been made for the estimated unrecoverable amounts based on information available to management.
Changes in the financial condition of customers may impact the level of provision required.
The provision at 31 March 2008 was 1,964,000 2007 3,680,000. d Useful lives of tangible and intangible assets Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful economic lives.
The period of actual use of economic benefit may vary from these estimated lives.
Details of the periods that these assets are depreciated over is set out in note 4 d and 4 f. AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 44 45 4 Summary of significant accounting policies a Revenue Revenue comprises fees in respect of initial and extension licences, annual licences and rentals, together with income from consultancy and other related services excluding VAT and similar taxes.
For each revenue stream, no revenue is recognised unless and until: a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced: delivery has been made in accordance with that contract: if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met: and the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable.
Users can pay an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee.
Additional users can be licenced at any time on payment of an extension fee similar to the initial and annual fees.
The fees cover right to use and post contract support, which includes core product enhancements and remote support services.
The fees related to the right to use are recognised once the above conditions have been met.
Post contract support fees are recognised rateably over the period of the contract.
As an alternative to the initial extension licence plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under two different types of rental contract.
Rentals which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental contracts are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, are non-cancellable and consist of two separate components, the right to use and the right for post contract support.
Revenue in respect of the right to use is recognised once the above conditions have been met and revenue for post contract support is recognised rateably over the period of the contract.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model.
Under this model, a basket of tokens representing licences to use the software over a dened period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required.
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a dened period, a proportion of revenue is recognised with an appropriate element deferred for post contract support obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions being met.
Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised based on actual number of tokens used.
The revenue and profit of development contracts is recognised on a percentage completion basis when the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably.
The stage of contract completion is usually determined by reference to the costs incurred to date as a proportion of the total estimated costs.
Only costs that reect the services performed to date and to be performed are included in costs incurred to date and the estimate of total costs.
When the contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised to the extent that costs can be recovered otherwise costs are expensed as incurred.
Income from consultancy and other related services is recognised as the services are provided.
b Foreign currencies The functional and presentational currency of AVEVA Group plc is pounds Sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the Balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the Consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction.
The subsidiaries have a number of different functional currencies.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into pounds Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance sheet date, and their Income statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Prior to 31 March 2004, cumulative exchange differences were reported as part of retained earnings.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 and is not required to record cumulative translation differences arising prior to the transition date.
In utilising this exemption, all cumulative translation differences are deemed to be zero as at 1 April 2004 and all subsequent disposals shall exclude any translation differences arising prior to the date of transition and the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
c Goodwill Goodwill which arose on acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 1998, and earlier periods, was written off to reserves in accordance with the UK GAAP accounting standard then in force.
As permitted by FRS 10 which replaced the previous standard, the goodwill previously written off to reserves has not been reinstated in the Balance sheet.
For acquisitions arising between 31 March 1998 and 31 March 2004, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities acquired, was capitalised under UK GAAP and written off on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life.
AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 46 47 Notes to the financial statements IFRS continued 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued c Goodwill continued The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3, Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations that took place before 1 April 2004.
As a result, the carrying amount of goodwill in the opening IFRS Balance sheet is that recorded under UK GAAP at 1 April 2004 date of transition.
Goodwill on acquisitions after 1 April 2004 is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill already carried in the Balance sheet is not amortised after 1 April 2004.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
If the potential benefit of tax losses or other deferred tax assets does not satisfy the criteria in IFRS 3 for separate recognition when a business combination is initially accounted for but is subsequently realised, the Group recognises the deferred tax income in the Income statement.
In addition, the Group also reduces the carrying value of the related goodwill by the amount that would have been recognised if the deferred tax asset had been recognised as an identiable asset from the acquisition date with a corresponding entry to administrative expenses.
d Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to each class of intangible assets as set out below.
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the Income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal software development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the asset, which are as follows: Years Tribon developed technology 5 Realitywave developed technology 12 Tribon customer relationships 20 Other software 3 Purchased software rights 510 e Research expenditure Research expenditure is written off in the year of expenditure.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the assets to their estimated residual value over the useful economic life of the asset as follows: Years Computer equipment 3 Fixtures, ttings and ofce equipment 68 Motor vehicles 4 Assets held under finance leases are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease for three years or useful economic life, if shorter.
Leasehold improvements are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease 3 to 49 years or useful economic life, if shorter.
Borrowing costs related to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are not capitalised.
g Impairment of assets Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies and represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash ows which are independent of other cash generating units.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income statement in the administrative expenses line item.
AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 46 47 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued h Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identied.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the Balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these approximates their fair value.
For the purpose of the Consolidated cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as dened above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
j Derivative financial instruments The only derivative financial instruments the Group holds are forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the year and therefore all forward foreign exchange contracts have been marked-to-market and are held at fair value on the Balance sheet with any movements being recorded in the Income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the Income statement.
k Leases Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benets incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benets of ownership of the asset are classied as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
l Taxation Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences: except where the deferred income tax liability arises from goodwill amortisation or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised: except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each Balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in the Income statement.
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales taxes except: where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales taxes included.
The net amount of sales taxes recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the Balance sheet.
AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 48 49 Notes to the financial statements IFRS continued 4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued m Post retirement benets The Group operates dened benefit pension schemes in the UK, Sweden and Germany.
The Group also provides certain post employment benets to its South Korean employees.
The UK dened benefit pension scheme, previously available to all UK employees, was closed to new applicants in 2002.
UK employees are now offered membership of a dened contribution scheme.
The German unfunded dened benefit scheme is closed to new applicants and provides benets to four deferred members following an acquisition in 1992 by Tribon.
No current employees participate in the scheme.
Full provision has been made for the liability on the Balance sheet.
The Group also operates a dened benefit pension scheme for one German employee.
The Group provides pension arrangements to its Swedish employees through an industry-wide dened benefit scheme.
It is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme which is attributable to the Company on a fair and reasonable basis.
Therefore the Group has applied the provisions in IAS 19 to account for the scheme as if it was a dened contribution scheme.
For the dened benefit schemes, the dened benefit obligation is calculated annually for each plan by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method which attributes entitlement to benets to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of dened benefit obligation.
The retirement benefit liability in the Balance sheet represents the present value of the dened benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality bonds as reduced by the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
The current service cost is recognised in the Income statement as an employee benefit expense.
The interest element of the dened benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long-term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benets paid during the year.
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the Income statement as finance revenue and finance costs respectively.
A past service credit is recognised immediately to the extent that benets are already vested, or is otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benets become vested.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited in the Statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates dened contribution pension schemes for a number of UK and non-UK employees.
Contributions to dened contribution plans are charged to profit before tax as they become payable.
n Share-based payments The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 January 2005.
Other equity-settled awards which are out of the scope of IFRS, have continued to be accounted for under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS, the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, further details of which are given in note 26.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of AVEVA Group plc market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fullled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the Directors of the Group at that date, are based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modied, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modied.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modication, as measured at the date of modication.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modication of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share, subject to an estimate of whether performance conditions will be met.

AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 50 51 Notes to the financial statements IFRS continued 6 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised on a geographical basis into four main sales regions: Asia Pacic, Americas, Central Eastern and Southern Europe CES and Western Europe, Middle East and Africa WEMEA.
Corporate functions and Research and Development operations are principally based in the UK and Sweden and are therefore not included in the sales regions analysis.
Each of these operating regions are organised and managed separately due to the differing local requirements in each market and therefore these are the primary segments.

13 Earnings per share The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are based on the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for the year of 34,246,000 2007 17,806,000.
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary shares.
Details of the terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 26.

The denominators used are the same as those detailed above for both basic and diluted earnings per share.
The adjustment made to profit after tax in calculating adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share has not been adjusted for tax in either the current or preceding year.
The Directors believe that adjusted earnings per share is a fairer presentation of the underlying performance of the business.

The total consideration was 20,277,000 and goodwill of 14,079,000 arose on the acquisition.
On 31 March 2005, the Group completed the acquisition of Realitywave Inc.
The consideration was 3,192,000 and goodwill of 1,855,000 arose on the acquisition.
Goodwill arose on the acquisition of rights to integrate, develop and market 3D design software from AEA Technology on 30 March 1999.
The initial cost of goodwill was 2,169,000.
In addition, on 12 November 1998 AVEVA agreed to acquire from the distributor Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha all AVEVAs business in Japan.
The goodwill arising on acquisition was 500,000.
AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 54 55 14 Goodwill continued The adjustments to the carrying value of the Tribon Solutions AB and Realitywave Inc. goodwill are due to the post-acquisition utilisation of tax losses, which were not recognised as deferred tax assets on acquisition.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGUs as follows: Asia WEMEA Pacic CES Americas Total Year ended 31 March 2008 000 000 000 000 000 Tribon Solutions AB 301 7,907 6,054 328 14,590 Realitywave Inc. 197 196 197 196 786 AEA Technology 108 976 1,084 Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha 229 229 498 8,440 6,251 1,500 16,689 Asia WEMEA Pacic CES Americas Total Year ended 31 March 2007 000 000 000 000 000 Tribon Solutions AB 267 7,018 5,374 291 12,950 Realitywave Inc. 199 200 200 200 799 AEA Technology 108 976 1,084 Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha 229 229 466 7,555 5,574 1,467 15,062 The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on managements estimates of growth in those specic markets based on past experience and external market information.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the year ending 31 March 2009 and extrapolates cash ows for the following four years based on an average estimated growth rate of between 10% and 15%.
Future cash ows are discounted in line with the weighted average cost of capital of approximately 10% pre-tax.

AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 60 61 Notes to the financial statements IFRS continued 23 Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, bank overdrafts, finance leases and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into forward currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been, throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
Interest rate risk The Group holds net funds, and hence its interest rate risk is associated with short-term cash deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice this has meant that no deposits have been made with a maturity date greater than three months in the course of the year.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The Group is exposed to uctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents.
The Group does not have any significant borrowings.
The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash equivalents balances.
A 1% decrease in the Sterling and US dollar interest rate would have reduced interest income by approximately 551,000 2007 323,000 and profit after tax by 386,000 2007 226,000.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations.
These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than their functional currency.
The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit.
The main exposures relate to the US dollar and Euro reecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Groups revenue and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research and Development, are settled in Sterling and Swedish Krona.
The Group reduces these exchange risks, where possible, by using currency exchange contracts and currency options for the sale of US dollar and Euro as appropriate.
The Group enters into specic forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts when the timing of forecast cash ows is reasonably certain.
In addition, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US dollars and Euro to match forecast cash ows arising from its recurring revenue base.
These are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
At 31 March 2008, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $13.5 million 2007 $3 million and 11 million 2007 10.5 million.
In addition, the Group utilises option instruments which have various provisions that, depending on the spot rate at maturity, give either the Group or the counterparty the option to exercise.
At 31 March 2008, the Group had outstanding currency options under which the Group may, under certain circumstances, be required to sell up to $19.5 million 2007 $nil and 13 million 2007 nil in exchange for Sterling.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
There is currently no requirement for borrowings and therefore this risk is not managed through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders equity.
The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Currency risks as dened by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature: differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Groups presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
A 5% change in the US dollar USD against Sterling, Euro EUR against Sterling and Swedish Krona SEK against Sterling would have impacted equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given current market conditions.

b Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash equivalents, trade and other receivables.
Counterparties for cash equivalents are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The amounts presented in the Balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identied loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ows.
The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis.
Credit checks are performed before credit is granted to new customers.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
Disclosures relating to the credit associated with trade receivables are in note 18. c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has no significant borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is not considered a significant risk at this time.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the Balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.

The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities in the Groups financial statements approximates their fair values.
f Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor market, creditor, customer and employee confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising of issued share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2007 or 2008.
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend.
The Group is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.
AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 62 63 24 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and the movements thereon during the current and preceding year: Accelerated Retirement capital Land and benefit Intangible Share allowances buildings obligations assets options Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2007 83 242 1,223 3,268 697 2,030 523 Charge credit to Income statement 319 22 13 1,083 69 42 884 Charge credit to equity 1,021 350 629 742 Reclassication 130 33 163 Exchange adjustment 13 13 At 31 March 2008 106 220 189 2,502 1,395 1,922 678 A deferred tax liability arises on the difference between the tax base and the accounting base of a long leasehold property that was acquired in 1994.
Other deferred tax assets consist principally of deferred tax on bad debt provision, staff bonus accrual and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2007 2006 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 2,065 3,105 Deferred tax assets 2,743 3,628 678 523 At the Balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1,006,000 2007 1,247,000 available for offset against future profits.
Of the total deferred tax asset of 334,000 2007 498,000, 56,000 2007 nil has been recognised and is included in other above.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the balance due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
The losses may be carried forward indefinitely 2007 498,000 expired over the years 2010 to 2014.
At the Balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately 27,500,000 2007 16,500,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by AVEVA Group plc to its shareholders.

This scheme was closed to new employees on 30 September 2002 with the option of re-opening if required and was converted to a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis on 30 September 2004.
Pensions are payable to dependants on death in retirement and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service.
There is an insurance policy in place which covers this liability.
Administration on behalf of the members is governed by a Trust Deed, and the funds are held and managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an independent professionally qualied actuary, Mercer Human Resource Consulting, at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
The employees contributions are xed as a percentage of salary, the balance being made up by the employer.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective Balance sheet dates.
AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 64 65 Notes to the financial statements IFRS continued 25 Retirement benefit obligations continued a UK dened benefit scheme continued To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The principal assumptions used in determining the pension valuation were as follows: 2008 2007 % % Main assumptions: Rate of salary increases 5.50 4.90 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.20 2.90 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 3.50 2.90 Discount rate 6.60 5.20 Ination assumption 3.20 2.90 Expected rate of return on scheme assets: Equities 6.65 6.65 Bonds 3.70 3.70 Other 4.25 4.25 For the years ended 31 March 2008 and 2007, the following weighted average life expectancy at age 65 for mortality has been used: 2008 2007 Years Years Male pensioners 23.7 21.9 Female pensioners 26.3 24.8 Non-retired males 26.6 23.0 Non-retired females 28.4 25.8 Member contributions were 7.5% 2007 7.5% of pensionable salary and Company contributions were 1,425,000 2007 3,294,000, which included a one-off special contribution of nil 2007 2,000,000.
The total contributions in 2009 are expected to be approximately 2,437,000.
The assets and liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2008 and 2007 were as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Equities 25,478 26,501 Bonds 6,057 4,828 Other 1,396 966 Total fair value of assets 32,931 32,295 Present value of scheme liabilities 33,600 36,368 Net pension liability 669 4,073 The amounts recognised in the Consolidated income statement and Statement of recognised income and expense for the year are analysed as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Recognised in the Consolidated income statement Current service cost Cost of sales 960 894 Selling and distribution costs 390 282 Administrative expenses 117 170 Total operating charge 1,467 1,346 Finance revenue Expected return on pension scheme assets 2,013 1,750 Finance costs Interest on pension scheme liabilities 1,930 1,607 Taken to Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense Actual return on pension scheme assets 780 1,216 Less: expected return on pension scheme assets 2,013 1,750 2,793 534 Changes in assumptions 6,156 2,170 Actuarial gain loss recognised in Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense 3,363 2,704 AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 64 65 25 Retirement benefit obligations continued a UK dened benefit scheme continued Analysis of movements in the present value of the dened benefit pension obligations during the year are analysed as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 At 1 April 36,368 31,227 Current service costs 1,467 1,346 Contributions by employees 463 448 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 1,930 1,607 Benets paid 435 396 Premiums paid 37 34 Actuarial gain loss 6,156 2,170 At 31 March 33,600 36,368 The above dened benefit obligation arises from a plan that is wholly funded.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRSs and taken directly to equity of 8,500,000 in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the pension schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004. b German dened benefit schemes There are two dened benefit pension schemes in AVEVA GmbH.
Tribon Solutions GmbH operated an unfunded dened benefit scheme that provides benets to four deferred members following an acquisition in 1992.
No current employees participate in the scheme and it is closed to new applicants.
benefit payments are made as they fall due.
The scheme was transferred to AVEVA GmbH when Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH merged in 2005.
In addition, AVEVA GmbH operates a dened benefit pension scheme for one employee.
This scheme is closed to new members.
Details of the actuarial assumptions used to value these schemes in accordance with IAS 19 are set out below: 2008 2007 Rate of increase of pension in payment 0% 0% Discount rate 4.75%5.50% 4.50% Mortality 14 years 16 years Rate of salary increases 2.5% 2.5% The retirement age for the Tribon Solutions GmbH scheme and AVEVA GmbH was 60 and 63 years of age respectively.

An IAS 19 valuation of the liability has been carried out using the following assumptions: 2008 2007 % % Rate of salary increases 5 5 Discount rate 5 5 Ination assumption 4.7 2.9 Analysis of movements in the present value of the obligation during the year are set out below: 2008 2007 000 000 At 1 April 340 294 Current service cost included in selling and distribution costs 154 107 Payment of benets 77 35 Exchange adjustment 33 26 At 31 March 384 340 d Other retirement schemes All Swedish employees employed by AVEVA AB aged 28 or over are members of the ITP, an industry scheme for salaried employees which provides benets in addition to the state pension arrangements.
The ITP scheme is managed by Alecta, a Swedish insurance company.
It is a multi-employer dened benefit scheme with a supplementary dened contribution component.
AVEVA AB pays monthly premiums to the insurers which vary by age, service and salary of the employee.
AVEVA AB is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a fair and reasonable basis because this information is not provided by the scheme and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it was a dened contribution pension scheme.
At 31 March 2008, Alectas surplus in the form of collective funding level was 141% 2007 153% which was calculated in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act for Insurance Companies.
The total cost charged to income was 570,000 2007 447,000. e Dened contribution schemes The Group operates dened contribution retirement schemes for certain UK, US, German, French, Norwegian and Asian employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The total cost charged to income of 1,507,000 2007 1,145,000 represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at the rates specified in the rules of the plans.
AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 66 67 26 Share-based payment plans The Group operates four equity-settled share option schemes, the AVEVA Group plc Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP : the AVEVA Group plc Employee and Executive Share Option Scheme Executive Scheme and Employee Scheme respectively : and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 2007 scheme.
The Executive and Employee schemes lapsed in 2006 and no grants have been made under the 2007 scheme which was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 12 July 2007.
Details of these plans are set out below.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of, and movements in, share options for both plans during the year: 2008 2008 2007 2007 Number WAEP p Number WAEP p Outstanding at start of year 582,861 160.52 1,123,131 177.43 Granted during year 59,663 3.33 78,648 3.33 Forfeited during year Exercised during year 153,900 94.70 608,718 172.26 Expired during year 10,200 118.45 Outstanding at end of year 488,624 162.06 582,861 160.52 Exercisable at end of year 94,782 115.25 158,682 158.79 Included within this balance are options over 67,782 2007 158,682 shares that have not been recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as the options were granted prior to 7 November 2002.
These options have not been subsequently modied and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised is 10.20 2007 7.28.

The weighted average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding at 31 March 2008 is 3.3 years 2007 3.2 years.
The average fair value of options granted during the year was 9.38 2007 3.53.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was 0.03 to 2.65 2007 0.03 to 2.65.
The Group recognised total expenses of 315,000 and 177,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the years ended 31 March 2008 and 2007 respectively.
AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 68 69 Notes to the financial statements IFRS continued 26 Share-based payment plans continued Details of the share option plans are as follows: a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP 2007 08 awards On 2 July 2007, a total of 59,663 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP.
This scheme was used because the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option and Employee Share Option schemes originally introduced in 1996 had expired and the new scheme, which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 12 July 2007, had not yet been established.
The performance conditions are based on average growth in earnings per share over the years from 2007 08 to 2009 10.
If average earnings per share growth is greater than 11.5% per annum then all of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is less than 9% per annum then none of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is between 9% and 11.5% per annum then the number of shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation.
The fair value of these option awards is measured at grant date using the Black Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Year ended 31 March 2008 Dividend yield 0.5% Expected volatility 31.90% Risk-free interest rate 5.75% Expected life of the option 3 years Weighted average share price 9.55 Weighted average exercise price 0.03 2006 07 awards On 28 June 2006 a total of 78,648 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP.
The exercise price of the options is equal to the nominal value of the underlying shares, which is 3.33p.
These options are subject to performance conditions which are based on average growth in earnings per share achieved over the three years from 2006 07 to 2008 09.
If average earnings per share growth is greater than 15% per annum then all of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is less than 7.5% per annum none of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is between 7.5% and 15% then the number of shares that shall vest will be determined by linear interpolation.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2007: Year ended 31 March 2007 Dividend yield 0.60% Expected volatility 31.90% Risk-free interest rate 4.89% Expected life of the option 3 years Weighted average share price 3.62 Weighted average exercise price 0.03 2004 05 awards A total of 90,000 share options were granted under the LTIP to certain senior executives on 1 July 2004.
The exercise price of the options is equal to the nominal value of the underlying ordinary shares, which is 3.33p.
The extent to which the options are exercisable will depend on the ranking of the Company in terms of total shareholder return measured against other companies in the London Stock Exchange techMARK 100 index.
The performance conditions will be measured three years from the date of grant and there is no allowance for retesting.
The contractual life of each option granted is seven years and the options become exercisable three years after the date of grant.
The options lapse if the option holder leaves the employment of the Group with certain specic exceptions.
AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements IFRS 68 69 26 Share-based payment plans continued a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP continued The options vest in accordance with the following scale: Percentage vesting of Total shareholder return ranking shares subject to option 75% and above 100% Median to 75% Pro rata on a straight line basis Median 33% Below median Nil The fair value of an award of shares under the LTIP has been adjusted to take into account Total Shareholder Return TSR as a market-based performance condition, using a pricing model that takes into account expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the comparator group.
The model follows similar principles as the Monte Carlo approach and takes into account that TSR vesting and share price performance are not independent.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2005: Year ended 31 March 2005 Dividend yield 1.23% Expected volatility 30.0% Risk-free interest rate 5.09% Expected life of the option 3 years Weighted average share price 1.83 Weighted average exercise price 0.03 b Employee and executive share option plan Options have also been granted under the AVEVA Group plc Employee Share Option Scheme and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme.
Pre-2004 awards The options will lapse if not exercised by the seventh anniversary from the date of grant.
All options are subject to performance conditions, which require earnings per share to outperform RPI utilisation by a total of 10% over a three year rolling period.
The share option rules were established at the time of the Companys initial public offering in 1996 and the performance conditions set were commonly used at that time.
2005 06 awards On 20 July 2005, a total of 255,531 options under the AVEVA Group plc Executive and Employee Share Option Schemes were awarded.
The performance conditions required to be achieved for the exercise of the option would be that earnings per share in the financial year ending 31 March 2008 would have grown no less than 5% above the Retail Price Index per annum from that achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2005.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2006.

The expected volatility reects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
