Pensions The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme for its UK employees who were employed before 1 October 2001 and defined contribution schemes for the remaining UK employees and for US employees.
The Groups Income Statement and Statement of Recognised Income and Expense for the years ended 31 March 2008 and 2007 included the following charges: Amounts charged to operating profit Year ended 31 March millions 2008 2007 Current service cost 19.8 21.5 Termination benefits 1.2 0.8 Amounts expensed for defined benefit scheme 21.0 22.3 Amounts expensed for defined contribution schemes 7.1 5.4 Total operating charge 28.1 27.7 Net finance income from defined benefit scheme Year ended 31 March millions 2008 2007 Expected return on pension scheme assets 19.6 16.5 Finance cost on pension scheme liabilities 17.6 15.7 Net finance income from defined benefit scheme 2.0 0.8 Amount recognised in statement of recognised income and expense Year ended 31 March millions 2008 2007 Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 24.4 0.2 Experience losses arising on the scheme liabilities 9.0 1.3 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 77.3 17.2 Actuarial gain 43.9 16.1 Deferred taxation on actuarial gain recognised in equity 12.3 4.8 Actuarial gain, net of tax 31.6 11.3 The cumulative actuarial gain net of tax recognised at 31 March 2008 amounts to 7.1 million 2007 - 24.5 million loss.
Yell Pension Plan YPP Defined benefit sections There are three defined benefit sections of the YPP, which have been closed to new entrants since 1 October 2001.
The scheme offers both pensions in retirement and death benefits to members.
The full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2005 updated to 31 March 2008 showed a surplus of 14.0 million.
Pension benefits are based on years of qualifying service and final pensionable salary.
Net surplus obligation The YPP net balance sheet surplus obligation at the balance sheet date represents the fair value of assets held to fund future benefit payments net of the present value of scheme liabilities, as follows.
At 31 March millions 2008 2007 Fair value of plan assets 308.9 302.4 Present value of scheme liabilities 294.9 329.6 Net surplus obligation 14.0 27.2 87 Yell Group plc Annual Report 2008 21.
Pensions continued The following table explains the changes in the net balance sheet surplus obligation : Year ended 31 March millions 2008 2007 Net obligation at beginning of year 27.2 39.9 Movement in year: Current service cost 19.8 21.5 Contributions 16.3 18.1 Past service costs 1.2 0.8 Finance income 2.0 0.8 Actuarial gain 43.9 16.1 Net surplus obligation at 31 March 14.0 27.2 As the scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost per employee member will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The level of contributions is based on the current service costs and the expected future cash flows of the scheme.
The Group is required to agree its contributions to the plan with the trustees based on actuarial advice.
Such agreement must be reached in a way which complies with the UK Pension Regulators Scheme Specific Funding guidance.
Any failure to agree would result in the intervention of the Pension Regulator and, possibly, an imposed settlement.
The Group made contributions during the last two years at the agreed rate of 23.6% of pensionable earnings.
Contributions of 15.4 million 2007 - 16.0 million, plus 0.9 million 2.1 million in respect of benefit augmentations were made in the year.
The next evaluation of future contribution rates will be after the next full valuation, with expected effect from 1 April 2009.
Additionally, Plan participants may accept a reduction in their salary in return for non-contributory membership of the Plan, the reduction being equal to the contributions otherwise payable.
The Group makes additional contributions of a corresponding amount.
In the years ended 31 March 2008 and 2007 these amounted to 2.8 million and 2.9 million, respectively 5.3% of pensionable earnings.
Total contributions in financial year 2009 are expected to be around 16 million.
Valuation assumptions The YPP net surplus was based on the valuation at 5 April 2005 updated to 31 March 2008 and 2007.
The updated valuations carried out by professionally qualified independent actuaries used the following key assumptions: At 31 March All figures in % per annum 2008 2007 Discount rate 6.7 5.2 Expected rate of return on assets 6.3 6.3 Salary increases 5.1 4.6 Pension increases 3.6 3.1 Inflation rate 3.6 3.1 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice from published statistics.
The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring in the future at age 60 is as follows: At 31 March Years 2008 2007 Male 26.5 26.5 Female 29.4 29.4 The average life expectancy of a member already retired at age 60 is as follows: At 31 March Years 2008 2007 Male 25.5 25.5 Female 28.3 28.3 88 Yell Group plc Annual Report 2008 Financial & shareholder information The assumptions used above may need to be adjusted in the future to take into account a full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2008, which is expected before the end of calendar year 2008.
Any such changes could materially affect the estimated liabilities of the scheme and future contribution rates.
Assets The YPP assets are held in separate trustee-administered funds that are invested in UK and overseas equities, property, debt securities and inflation swaps.
The trustees of the scheme are required to act in the best interest of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees to the scheme is determined by the Group in accordance with the schemes trust documentation, as modified by UK statute.
An independent professional trustee and three other trustees are appointed by the Group.
Three further trustees are elected by the active members.
Asset values will increase and decrease as markets rise and fall.
The trustees and management have an agreed strategy to mitigate the risk of having insufficient funds if markets fall.
The trustees annually match the low-risk asset portfolio against the cash outflows for the following twelve years.
Against longer term cash pay-outs they match a combination of investments in inflation swaps to mitigate inflation risk, and higher risk assets to get higher rates of growth.
The trustees also work with management to ensure sufficient assets will be available to settle obligations extending beyond the horizon of 12 years.
The trustees set asset allocation targets at 31 March 2006 in which approximately 55% of the assets held should be equity investments and 45% should be debt securities.
The trustees changed their asset allocation approach during the year ended 31 March 2007, splitting the portfolio into pre-horizon and post-horizon categories.
The pre-horizon assets are all debt securities and at 31 March 2008 comprised around 20% 2007 - 17% of the total assets.
The post-horizon assets have allocation targets of 60% equities, 10% property and 30% inflation swaps.
The expected rates of return of each asset type in the YPP are set by reference to yields available on government bonds at the measurement date and appropriate risk margins, and are stated gross of the expected levy to the UK Pension Protection Fund.
The assets and the annual expected rates of return were: At 31 March 2008 2007 %m %m Equities 7.5 145.2 7.5 157.5 Bonds 5.3 62.1 5.2 51.1 Gilts 4.5 69.9 Property 6.5 21.0 6.5 23.9 Inflation swaps 4.8 80.6 Total assets at fair value 308.9 302.4 Changes in the fair value of plan assets were as follows: Year ended 31 March millions 2008 2007 Opening fair value of plan assets 302.4 271.2 Expected return 19.6 16.5 Actuarial losses gains 24.4 0.2 Contributions by employer 16.3 18.1 Contributions by participants 0.2 0.2 Benefits paid 5.2 3.8 Fair value of plan assets at 31 March 308.9 302.4 The actuarial loss in the year ended 31 March 2008 represents the difference between the expected return on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets as follows: Year ended 31 March millions 2008 2007 Expected return on plan assets 19.6 16.5 Actuarial loss gain 24.4 0.2 Actual loss return on plan assets 4.8 16.7 89 Yell Group plc Annual Report 2008 21.
Pensions continued Liabilities The present value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cashflows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit method.
The projected unit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit liabilities were as follows: Year ended 31 March millions 2008 2007 Opening present value of defined benefit liabilities 329.6 311.1 Current service cost 19.8 21.5 Past service costs 1.2 0.8 Finance cost 17.6 15.7 Actuarial gains 68.3 15.9 Contributions by participants 0.2 0.2 Benefits paid 5.2 3.8 Present value of defined benefit liabilities at 31 March 294.9 329.6 The actuarial gains in the years ended 31 March 2008 and 2007 were primarily the result of an increase in the estimated real interest rate the reference market rate to which the discount rate is tied, net of expected inflation interest in the market price of certain government debt during the year.
The accumulated benefit obligation is an alternative actuarial measure of the present value of benefits for service already rendered.
This measure differs from the projected unit method in that it allows for deferred pension increases instead of future salary increases and, therefore, measures the obligations as if the employees were no longer able to earn benefits from future service.
At 31 March 2008 the accumulated benefit obligation was 263.6 million or 45.3 million less than scheme assets.
The profile of expected undiscounted payments by the scheme for benefits earned up to 31 March 2008 is as follows: Payments in millions 55m 50m 40m 35m 30m 25m 20m 15m 10m 5m 0m 2008 2018 2028 2038 2048 2058 2068 2078 2088 Year The Group estimates that the average duration of these cashflows, representing the weighted average term to payment of the undiscounted benefit payments, is 36 years.
The cost of settling all scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date by buying out benefits with a suitable insurer will generally be higher than the present value of scheme liabilities, because an insurer would expect to charge a premium for the risks that would be passed to them.
The Group estimates that the amount required to settle the schemes liabilities with an insurance company at 31 March 2008 would have been around 390 million, which is around 80 million more than the value of plan assets.

The discount rate and expected inflation are determined by reference to specific types of debt instruments being traded in the open market.
Increasing or decreasing the assumed real interest rate to 3.2% or 3.0% per annum, respectively, would decrease or increase the present value of pension liabilities by approximately 8 million.
The effect on the market value of assets cannot be estimated because the values of the schemes investments do not always change in line with changes in real interest rates.
The present value of pension liabilities was determined on assumed life expectancies for men and women as set out in the assumptions above.
We estimate that an increase in life expectancy of one year for all members could have increased the present value of pension liabilities by approximately 6 million.
Furthermore, we estimate that changing the actuarial tables used in determining life expectancies to the most recent tables with a medium cohort adjustment or changing the adjustment for the cohort effect from medium-term to long-term on the currently used tables could have had the effect of increasing the present value of pension liabilities by 3 million or 17 million, respectively.
The present value of pension liabilities was determined on the basis of a 1.5% expected average increase in salaries above inflation.
Increasing or decreasing the rate of assumed salary increases to 1.6% or 1.4% per annum, respectively, could have increased or decreased the present value of pension liabilities by approximately 3 million.
Defined contribution schemes In addition to the defined contribution Section Four of the YPP, Yellowbook sponsors a 401 k plan for the majority of Yellowbook employees in the US.
The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and or after-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines.
Yellowbook matches a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits.
The assets of the plan are held separately from those of Yellowbook in an independently administered fund.
The pension cost in respect of these schemes represents contributions payable to the funds and amounted to 4.6 million in the year ended 31 March 2008 2007 - 4.1 million for the Yellowbook scheme, and 2.5 million 2007 - 1.3 million for Section Four of the YPP.
Outstanding contributions amounted to nil as at 31 March 2008 2007 - nil.
