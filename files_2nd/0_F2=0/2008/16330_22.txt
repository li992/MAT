50 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group 31 December 2008 1 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating divisions Aircraft & Vehicle Systems, Information & Power Systems and Tactical & Sonar Systems.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.

These are calculated as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Profit from operations 64,074 59,006 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 13,017 3,915 Headline operating profit 77,091 62,921 Loss profit before tax 2,888 56,598 Loss on fair value movements on derivatives 62,069 556 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 13,017 3,915 Headline profit before tax 72,198 61,069 Cash generated by operations see note 28 94,579 66,249 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 14,198 8,569 Proceeds on disposal of property, plant and equipment 1,231 - Expenditure on product development and other intangibles 1,941 5,489 Purchase of Long-Term Incentive Plan shares 674 - Operating cash flow 78,997 52,191 Headline operating profit has been shown before the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, which relates to acquired intellectual property, customer relationships and profit in acquired order book.
To maintain a consistent presentation of financial performance over the longer term, this charge has been excluded from headline operating profit.
Headline profit before tax and headline earnings per share see note 12 are also presented before the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition.
IAS 39 requires the Group to fair value the derivative instruments used to manage Ultras foreign exchange exposures.
This creates volatility in the valuation of the outstanding instruments as exchange rates move over time.
This will have minimal impact on profit over the full term of the instruments, but can cause significant volatility on particular balance sheet dates.
Ultra is therefore stating headline profit before tax and headline earnings per share see note 12 before changes in the valuation of these instruments so that the headline operating performance of the Group can more clearly be seen.
The Group is cash generative and reinvests funds to support the continuing growth of the business.
It seeks to use an accurate and appropriate measure of the funds generated internally while sustaining this growth.
For this, Ultra uses operating cash flow, rather than cash generated by operations, as its preferred indicator of cash generated and available to cover non-operating expenses such as tax and interest payments.
The Group believes that using cash generated by operations, with the exclusion of net expenditure in property, plant and equipment and outflows for capitalised product development and other intangibles, would result in an understatement of the true cash cost of sustaining a growing business.
3 Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Sales of goods 281,047 211,039 Revenue from long term contracts 234,224 201,851 515,271 412,890 4 Other operating income Amounts included in other operating income were as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Foreign exchange gains 2,762 5,050 Profit on disposal of fixed assets 682 - 3,444 5,050 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 53 Financials Group Notes to accounts Group continued 5 Other operating expenses Amounts included in other operating expenses were as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Amortisation of development costs 1,217 949 Foreign exchange losses 1,929 43 3,146 992 6 Profit from operations Profit from operations is stated after charging crediting : 2008 2007 000 000 Raw materials and other bought in inventories expensed in the year 188,725 169,580 Inventories written down and recognised as an expense in the year 909 934 Reversals of write-downs of inventory 42 140 Staff costs see note 7 146,086 119,266 Depreciation and amounts written off property, plant and equipment 7,026 5,720 Amortisation of internally generated intangible assets 1,217 949 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 14,271 4,518 Net foreign exchange gains 833 5,007 Profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 682 31 Operating lease rentals plant and machinery 902 969 other 5,567 4,562 Research and development costs 31,923 26,040 Auditors remuneration for statutory audit work including expenses 452 404 The Company only audit fee included in the Group audit fee shown above was 15,000 2007: 10,000.

The amortisation of intangible assets charge is included within administrative expenses.
Included within other are transfers from fixed assets of 101,000.
Additional consideration relating to acquisitions made during 2007, together with a re-assessment of the provisional fair values of the net assets acquired for BCF Designs Limited and Atkins & Partners Limited, both of which were acquired in November 2007, has resulted in adjustments to goodwill of 5,835,000 see note 31.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 57 Financials Group Notes to accounts Group continued 13 Intangible assets continued Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, typically as follows: Intellectual property 5 to 10 years Customer relationships 3 to 10 years Development costs 2 to 10 years Software 3 to 5 years Patents and trademarks 10 to 20 years Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash Generating Units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
These consist of the Groups operating businesses.
Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs as set out below: 2008 2007 000 000 Datel 14,485 13,934 Dascam 7,792 - Electrics 9,358 5,335 Precision Air Systems 1,200 1,200 Aircraft & Vehicle Systems 32,835 20,469 Airport Systems 24,888 24,888 ATS 4,269 4,269 Command & Controls 13,849 12,874 Nuclear Sensors & Process Instrumentation 11,500 - PMES 3,356 3,356 ProLogic 26,343 - Information & Power Systems 84,205 45,387 Audiosoft 3,349 - Criticom 8,994 5,584 DNE Technologies 19,131 13,869 Flightline 1,653 1,196 Maritime Systems 14,752 - Ocean Systems 6,398 5,321 Tactical Communication Systems 19,398 19,389 UnderSea Sensor Systems Inc 18,847 17,595 Tactical & Sonar Systems 92,522 62,954 Total Ultra Electronics 209,562 128,810 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Following a detailed review, no impairment losses have been recognised in the year.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plan.
These plans, which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU over the next five years.
The cash flows beyond this period are then extrapolated for the next five years using a growth rate of nil per cent.
58 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 13 Intangible assets continued The goodwill allocated to nine CGUs is considered to be individually significant.
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations for these CGUs were as follows: Tax rate Post tax applied to discount rate cash flows Airport Systems 8.2% 28% Command & Control Systems 8.2% 28% Datel 8.2% 28% Nuclear Sensors & Process Instrumentation 8.2% 35% ProLogic 8.2% 35% DNE Technologies 8.2% 35% Maritime Systems 8.2% 34% Tactical Communication Systems 8.2% 34% UnderSea Sensor Systems Inc 8.2% 35% There was significant headroom within the value-in-use calculations for all CGUs and sensitivity analysis has indicated that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.
The net book value of plant and machinery held under finance leases was 115,000 2007: 32,000.
Depreciation charged in the year on assets held under finance leases was 33,000 2007: 24,000.

The average credit period on sale of goods is 46 days 2007: 37 days.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are major high street banks.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements see note 23 net of any allowances for losses represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.

The Groups banking facilities are provided by a small syndicate of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland.
There are two facilities in place, one which was renewed in 2005, providing 120 million of revolving credit over a five year period, and a second which was put in place in 2008, providing a further 80 million of revolving credit over a three year period.
Both facilities are denominated in sterling, US dollars and Canadian dollars and are used for balance sheet and operational needs.
A further 10 million overdraft is available for short-term working capital funding.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Interest is charged at 0.375% 2007: 0.375% over base rate.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had available 92,168,206 2007: 78,187,000 of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
The 120 million facility expires in November 2010 and the 80 million facility expires in September 2011.

The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros.
At 31 December 2008, the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately 60,134,000 2007: asset of 1,935,000, comprising 8,255,000 assets 2007: 5,373,000 included in trade and other receivables and 68,389,000 liabilities 2007: 3,438,000 included in trade and other payables.
The loss on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 62,069,000 2007: loss of 556,000.
The net notional, or net contracted amounts of foreign currency related forward sales purchase contracts, classified by year of maturity are shown below.
The associated foreign currency translation risk is hedged by external borrowings in US and Canadian dollars.
The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 63 Financials Group Notes to accounts Group continued 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Interest rate risk During the year the Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The interest rate swaps, denominated in US dollars and Canadian dollars, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The swaps will mature in December 2011 and have fixed swap rates ranging from 3.93% to 4.29%.
The floating rates are US dollar LIBOR and Canadian dollar LIBOR.
At the year end the nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps were US dollar 100 million 2007: US dollar 20 million and Canadian dollar 20 million 2007: Canadian dollar 30 million.
The interest rate swaps are designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value has been charged to equity.
At 31 December 2008, the net fair value of interest rate swaps was a liability of 4,472,000 2007: liability of 55,000, comprising nil of assets 2007: 10,000 included in trade and other receivables and 4,472,000 of liabilities 2007: 65,000 included in trade and other payables.
The amount recycled from the income statement during the year was 195,000 and has been charged to interest cost in the year 2007: an amount of 154,000 was recycled to the income statement and was credited against interest cost in the year.
The fair value will be realised in the income statement on a quarterly basis over the next three years 2007: one year.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Groups share price.
Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 12.03.
The fair value of options granted during the year was 1,470,425 2007: 1,993,343.
The Groups equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value for all schemes other than the 2007 and 2008 LTIP schemes is measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2008 Weighted average share price 12.30 10.40 10.23 8.53 Weighted average exercise price 10.39 10.24 10.13 n a Expected volatility % 21.9 19.8 19.8 18.6 Expected option life years 3.8 6.0 5.0 3.0 Risk free interest rate % 4.9 4.8 4.6 4.5 Expected dividends % 1.6 1.7 1.7 1.6 Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2007 Weighted average share price 11.79 8.79 8.46 7.06 Weighted average exercise price 9.9 8.66 8.37 n a Expected volatility % 21.0 20.0 19.2 18.9 Expected option life years 3.56 6.0 5.0 3.0 Risk free interest rate % 4.9 4.8 4.7 4.4 Expected dividends % 1.6 1.8 1.8 1.9 Figures in the above table show an average across the schemes.
For the 2007 and 2008 LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at grant date as this is the most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition.
The fair value of these schemes has been calculated using the following assumptions: 2008 Exercise price n a Share price at grant 12.02 Expected option life years 3.0 Expected volatility % 23.9 Expected dividend yield % 0.0 Risk free interest rate % 4.7 Figures in the above table show an average across the schemes.

Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
For the UK scheme, a 0.25% increase in the inflation assumption to 3.25% and a 0.1% reduction in the discount rate to 6.15% would increase the schemes liabilities by 5.1% and 2.0% respectively.
If the members were to experience the mortality of an individual one year older the scheme liabilities would drop by 1.7%.
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners.
