Risk Management policies and procedures As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to acheive its investment objective as stated on page 17.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the revenue available for distribution by way of dividends.
These financial risks, market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity and credit risk, and the Directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The Investment Manager, in close cooperation with the Board of Directors, coordinates the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks, and the methods used to manage these risks, that are set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period.
i Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises currency risk see note 19 ii, interest rate risk see note 19 iii and market price risk see note 19 iv.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks.
The Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Annual Report and Accounts 31 December 2008 49 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 19.
Risk Management policies and procedures continued ii Currency risk A proportion of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency, and in which it reports its results.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
At 31 December 2008, the value of non-sterling denominated investments amounted to 415,686,000 2007: 846,066,000.
Management of the risk The Investment Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Foreign currency borrowing and forward currency contracts are used to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items which have foreign currency exposure at 31 December 2008 are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, the principals have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall exposure.

Risk Management policies and procedures continued ii Currency risk continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after tax for the year and the equity in regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for Sterling US dollar, Sterling Canadian dollar, Sterling Australian dollar and Sterling Rand.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: Sterling US dollar -25% 2007: 5% Sterling Canadian dollar -10% 2007: 20% Sterling Australian dollar -10% 2007: 10% Sterling Rand -5% 2007: 10% These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
If sterling had weakened against the currencies shown below, this would have had the following effect: 2008 2007 US Canadian Australian US Canadian Australian dollar dollar dollar Rand dollar dollar dollar Rand 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Projected change 25% 10% 10% 5% 5% 20% 10% 10% Impact on revenue return 3,554 142 319 229 383 332 1,192 422 Impact on capital return 54,881 4,440 5,500 3,468 17,360 32,533 16,455 11,885 Total return after tax effect on shareholders funds 58,435 4,582 5,819 3,697 17,743 32,865 17,647 12,307 If sterling had strengthened against the currencies shown below, this would have had the following effect: 2008 2007 US Canadian Australian US Canadian Australian dollar dollar dollar Rand dollar dollar dollar Rand 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Projected change 25% 10% 10% 5% 5% 20% 10% 10% Impact on revenue return 2,132 116 261 207 114 54 482 150 Impact on capital return 32,929 3,633 4,500 3,138 15,707 21,689 13,455 9,724 Total return after tax effect on shareholders funds 35,061 3,749 4,761 3,345 15,821 21,743 13,937 9,874 Annual Report and Accounts 31 December 2008 51 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 19.
Risk Management policies and procedures continued iii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk movements may affect the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings and the level of income receivable on cash deposits.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and borrowing under the multi-currency loan facility.
The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances, with short term borrowings being used when required.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December of financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates when the interest rate is due to be re-set fixed interest rates when the financial instrument is due for repayment 2008 2007 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Bank overdrafts 3,104 3,104 543 543 The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between floating and fixed interest rates change.
The Company has little exposure to interest rates as the majority of financial assets are equity shares which do not pay interest.
Therefore, the Companys total income and equity is not materially affected by changes in interest rates.
Interest receivable, and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances or paid on bank overdrafts respectively is approximately 4.32% and 5.43% per annum 2007: 5.29% and 6.42% per annum.

Risk Management policies and procedures continued iv Market price risk Market price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the investments.
The Companys investments are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future prices of investments.
Management of the risk The Board of Directors manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the Investment Managers compliance with the Companys objective, and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation.
When appropriate, the Company manages its exposure to risk by buying selling put or call options on indices and on equity or commodity investments in its portfolio.
The Companys exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December 2008 on its quoted and unquoted equity or commodity investments and options on indices and investments was 581,978,000 2007: 1,272,222,000.
Concentration of exposure to market price risks An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on pages 13 and 14.
At 31 December 2008, this shows the majority of the investments value is in UK companies, with significant amounts also in Latin America, South Africa, Australia and the USA.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those countries, though it is recognised that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the equity to an increase or decrease of 20% in the fair values of the Companys equities including equity exposure through options.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions in 2008.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and equity exposure through options at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The impact of a 20% increase in the value of investments on the revenue return as at 31 December 2008 is a decrease of 1,048,000 2007: 1,544,000 and on the capital return is an increase of 116,340,000 2007: 253,343,000.
The impact of a 20% decrease in the value of investments on the revenue return as at 31 December 2008 is an increase of 1,048,000 2007: 1,544,000 and on the capital return is a decrease of 116,340,000 2007: 253,343,000.

Risk Management policies and procedures continued v Liquidity and credit risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity and credit risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Company has an overdraft facility of 40 million 2007: 40 million and a multi-currency loan facility of 60 million 2007: 60 million.
The Board gives guidance to the Investment Manager as to the maximum amounts of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should remain 75% invested in normal market conditions and that 25% of the Companys assets may be invested in cash or cash equivalents.
Short term borrowings may be used to manage short term cash requirements.
Liquidity and credit risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 December, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, was as follows: Not more 3 months than one More than or less year one year Total 2008 000 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Bank overdrafts 3,104 3,104 Amounts due to brokers and accruals 2,227 479 2,706 5,331 479 5,810 2007 Current liabilities: Bank overdrafts 543 543 Amounts due to brokers and accruals 4,446 789 5,235 4,989 789 5,778 The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.

Risk Management policies and procedures continued v Liquidity and credit risk continued Management of the risk The risk is managed as follows: where the Investment Manager makes an investment in a bond, corporate or otherwise, the credit rating of the issuer is taken into account so as to determine the risk to the Company of default: transactions involving derivatives are either exchange traded where the relevant exchange guarantees settlement or on an over the counter basis.
Transactions are entered into only with those counterparties approved by the credit department of the Investment Manager.
Counterparties are selected on the basis of a number of risk migration criteria designed to reduce the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the Investment Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: the credit worthiness of financial institutions with whom cash is held is reviewed regularly by the Investment Manager: the credit worthiness of counterparties to stock lending is assessed by the Investment Manager prior to trading and on a regular ongoing basis.
All transactions are secured with collateral to 105% of the value of the stock on loan.
In summary, compared to the amounts included in the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December was as follows: 2008 2007 Balance Balance Sheet Sheet 000 000 Other receivables amounts due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable 14,801 1,772 None of the Companys financial liabilities are past due or impaired.
vi Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the Balance Sheet at their fair value investments and derivatives or the balance sheet amount which is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank, bank overdrafts and amounts due under the multi-currency loan facility.
