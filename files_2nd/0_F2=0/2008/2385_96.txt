168 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes on financial statements 41.
Share-based payments continued Plans for executive directors Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP share element An equity-settled incentive share plan for executive directors driven by one performance measure over a three-year performance period.
The award of shares is determined by comparing BPs total shareholder return TSR against the other oil majors.
After the performance period, the shares that vest net of tax are then subject to a three-year retention period.
In February 2008 it was considered appropriate to strengthen the retention element of remuneration for two executive directors.
The remuneration committee granted, on a one-off basis, a restricted share award to those two executive directors.
The shares will vest subject to continued service, in equal tranches, after three and five years.
Vesting of each tranche is dependent on the committee being satisfied, at each vesting date, with the performance of the individuals.
These retention awards have been granted under EDIP which permits awards to be made, on an exceptional basis, subject to a requirement of continued service over a specific period.
The directors remuneration report on pages 77 to 87 includes full details of this plan.
Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP share option element An equity-settled share option plan for executive directors that permits options to be granted at an exercise price no lower than the market price of a share on the date that the option is granted.
Options vest over three years one-third each after one, two and three years respectively and must be exercised within seven years of the date of grant.
From 2005 onwards the remuneration committees policy is not to make further grants of share options to executive directors.
Plans for senior employees Medium Term Performance Plan MTPP An equity-settled restricted share unit plan for senior employees driven by two performance measures over a three-year performance period.
At the end of the performance period units are converted into shares.
The amount of units converted to shares is determined by comparing BPs TSR against the other oil majors and, additionally, by comparing free cash flow FCF against a threshold established for the period.
For a small group of particularly senior employees only the TSR measure is applicable in determining the award.
The number of units converted into shares is increased to take account of the net notional dividends that would have been received during the performance period, assuming that such dividends would have been reinvested.
With regard to leaver provisions the general rule is that leaving employment during the performance period will preclude the conversion of units into shares.
However, special arrangements apply where the participant leaves for a qualifying reason and employment ceases after completion of the first year of the performance period.
The current policy of the company, which is reflected in the terms of the MTPP, is that senior employees subject to the plan should meet a minimum shareholding requirement.
Grants will not be made under this plan after 2008.
Senior Employees Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB An equity-settled restricted share unit plan for senior employees.
In 2008 the grant value is equal to 50% 2007 and 2006 50% of the annual cash bonus awarded for the preceding performance year the performance period.
For 2009 this will increase to 100%.
The units are restricted for a period of three years the restriction period, during which they accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested.
At the end of the restriction period units are converted into shares.
With regard to leaver provisions, if a participant ceases to be employed by BP prior to the end of the performance period the general rule is that this will preclude the grant of units.
If a participant ceases to be employed by BP prior to the end of the restriction period the general rule is that this will preclude the conversion of units into shares.
However, special arrangements apply where the participant leaves for a qualifying reason.
Integrated Supply and Trading Deferred Annual Bonus Plan IST DAB An equity-settled restricted share unit plan for traders in the IST function.
The plan operates under the DAB but the rules differ in certain respects from that plan.
If eligible, a portion of a traders annual cash bonus the base grant, awarded for the preceding performance year the performance period, plus an additional 25% of that amount the additional grant, will be deferred in restricted share units.
The units are restricted over a period of three calendar years, during which they accrue net notional dividends, which are treated as having been reinvested.
One third of the base grant vests after one and two calendar years respectively, with the final third plus the additional grant vesting after three calendar years.
With regard to leaver provisions, if a participant ceases to be employed by BP prior to the end of the restriction period the general rule is that this will preclude the conversion of units into shares.
Special arrangements apply where the participant leaves for a qualifying reason.
Performance Share Plan PSP An equity-settled restricted share unit plan for senior professionals and team leaders.
The grant takes into account the recipients performance in the prior calendar year the performance period.
The units are restricted for a period of three years the restriction period, during which they accrue net notional dividends, which are treated as having been reinvested.
At the end of the restriction period additional units may be awarded based on BPs TSR performance against the other oil majors.
With regard to leaver provisions the general rule is that leaving during the performance period will preclude the grant of units.
Restricted Share Plan RSP An equity-settled restricted share unit plan used predominantly for senior employees in special circumstances such as recruitment and retention.
There are generally no performance conditions but the units are subject to a three-year restriction period, during which they accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested.
At the end of the restricted period the units are converted into shares.

Share-based payments continued BP Share Option Plan BPSOP An equity-settled share option plan that applies to certain categories of employees.
Participants are granted share options with an exercise price no lower than the market price of a share immediately preceding the date of grant.
There are no performance conditions and the options are exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the grant date.
The general rule is that the options will lapse if the participant leaves employment before 1 the end of the third calendar year from the date of grant and that vested options are exercisable within 3 2 years from the date of leaving.
However, special arrangements apply where the participant leaves for a qualifying reason and employment ceases after the end of the calendar year of the date of grant.
From 2007 share options no longer form a regular element of our incentive plans.
Savings and matching plans BP ShareSave Plan This is a savings-related share option plan under which employees save on a monthly basis, over a three-year or five-year period, towards the purchase of shares at a fixed price determined when the option is granted.
This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price at the time of grant.
The option must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract: otherwise it lapses.
The plan is run in the UK and options are granted annually, usually in June.
Participants leaving for a qualifying reason will have six months in which to use their savings to exercise their options on a pro rated basis.
BP ShareMatch Plans These are matching share plans under which BP matches employees own contributions of shares up to a predetermined limit.
The plans are run in the UK and in more than 70 other countries.
The UK plan is run on a monthly basis with shares being held in trust for five years before they can be released free of any income tax and national insurance liability.
In other countries the plan is run on an annual basis with shares being held in trust for three years.
The plan is operated on a cash basis in those countries where there are regulatory restrictions preventing the holding of BP shares.
When the employee leaves BP all shares must be removed from trust and units under the plan operated on a cash basis must be encashed.
Local plans In some countries BP provides local scheme benefits, the rules and qualifications for which vary according to local circumstances.
The above share plans are indicated as being equity-settled.
In certain countries however, it is not possible to award shares to employees owing to local legislation.
In these instances the award will be settled in cash, calculated as the cash equivalent of the value to the employee of an equitysettled plan.
Cash plans Cash-settled share-based payments Stock Appreciation Rights SARs These are cash-settled share-based payments available to certain employees that require the group to pay the intrinsic value of the cash option SAR restricted shares to the employee at the date of exercise or on maturity.
The cash options SARs have the same rules as the BPSOP plan and the cash restricted share plans MTPP, DAB, PSP, RSP have the same rules as their equity-settled counterparts.
Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs ESOPs have been established to acquire BP shares to satisfy any awards made to participants under the BP share plans as required.
The ESOPs have waived their rights to dividends on shares held for future awards and are funded by the group.
Until such time as the companys own shares held by the ESOP trusts vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is deducted in arriving at shareholders equity see Note 40.
Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the group.
At 31 December 2008 the ESOPs held 29,051,082 shares 2007 6,448,838 shares and 2006 12,795,887 shares for potential future awards, which had a market value of $220 million 2007 $79 million and 2006 $142 million.
Share-based payments continued As share options are exercised continuously throughout the year, the weighted average share price during the year of $10.87 2007 $11.72 and 2006 $11.85 is representative of the weighted average share price at the date of exercise.
