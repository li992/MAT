Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modi ed by the revaluation of property, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards UK GAAP.
Revenue recognition Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to its net carrying amount.

Tangible xed assets Other than revalued land and buildings, property, plant and equipment are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
On other assets depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down their cost or valuation to their estimated residual values by equal instalments over their estimated economic useful lives, which are considered to be: Freehold buildings up to 50 years Leasehold buildings the period of the lease Plant and equipment 10 years Investment in Group undertakings Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
Operating leases Operating lease rental charges are taken to the pro t and loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Provisions A provision is recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that settlement will be required of an amount that can be reliably estimated.
Long term liabilities and provisions are discounted when the impact is material.
Current tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided for at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full at the anticipated tax rates on differences arising from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of xed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset.

Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the date of the transactions.

These translation differences are dealt with in the pro t and loss account.
Pensions The Company operates fide ned bene t pension schemes.
The fide ned bene t schemes are multi-employer schemes including employees of other Group companies.
It is not considered possible to allocate scheme assets and liabilities between the various companies and accordingly schemes are accounted for as though they were fide ned contribution schemes.
The amount charged to the pro t and loss account is the contribution payable in the year.
Differences between amounts payable and actually paid are shown as accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet.
Share-based compensation For grants made under the Companys share-based remuneration schemes, amounts which re ect the fair value of options awarded at the time of grant are charged to the pro t and loss account.
