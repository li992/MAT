The provision represents the actuarial estimate of the fair value of the guarantee at 31 December 2008.
Investment Trust VAT On 5 November 2007, HM Revenue and Customs HMRC agreed that management services to UK Investment Trust Companies ITCs should be exempt from VAT.
As a result, the Company, in common with other asset managers in the UK, received claims from ITCs for the repayment of VAT charged to them for historic periods dating back to 1990.
While the Company charged VAT in accordance with applicable UK law at the time, a provision was recognised in 2007 to the extent that the expected payments to be made to ITCs are greater than the expected amount recoverable from HMRC.
During 2008 monies refunded from HMRC have been paid, as required, to ITCs.
However, due to the complexity of the repayment process and its interaction with contractual arrangements, uncertainty still exists as to the final cost to be incurred by the Company.
The provision of 1.4m at 31 December 2007: 1.4m represents the estimate of the expected liability of the Company.
Provisions for liabilities contd Onerous premises contracts The Company holds all properties under operating leases.
This includes a number of vacant or sub-let properties which were either previously occupied by the Company or are partially occupied by the Company.
Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments where significant, after taking into account existing and expected sub-tenant contractual arrangements.
The remaining terms are for up to 12 years.
Assumptions have been made as to whether each leasehold property may be sub-let or assigned in the future.
All leases and sub-leases are for minimum guaranteed rentals.
The provision is subject to uncertainties over time including market rent reviews and break-options within the lease arrangements.
The amount included within Profit and Loss in respect of unwinding of the discount on onerous premises provisions in 2008 is 0.3m 2007: 0.2m.
Deferred tax The deferred tax provision relates to short-term timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
The provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of the timing of the reversal of the timing differences.
The provision relates to the revaluation of available for sale assets and is recognised as a separate component of reserves.
Deferred taxation is disclosed in note 13.

iii The US $4.0m loan was due to Friends Ivory & Sime North America Inc, a former overseas subsidiary, which was put into liquidation on 31 December 2008.
