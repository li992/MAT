Ashtead Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2008 | Corporate responsibility report | 45 Whilst these emission levels are low relative to our revenues and employee numbers, we recognise that most of our emissions are generated by our delivery truck eet in transporting our equipment to our customers job-sites.
Our customers expect and pay for this delivery but we are working on a number of initiatives to enable our customers to help us reduce our emission levels and the delivery charges we make to them.
For example on big, long-term construction sites where the customer is prepared to commit to using our services on a sole supply basis, we are increasingly prepared to place a pool of our equipment at the job-site enabling equipment to be sourced on-site and therefore cutting back the sites overall transportation needs.
Contributing to the community The Board recognises the importance of giving back to the communities where we do business as well as further a eld.
We have a number of community programmes across both the US and the UK as well as individual initiatives around each of our depots.
In the US, we have created a programme that combines our local and national resources to provide consistent support to a charitable organisation and we leverage our decentralised business structure to facilitate local involvement.
Through this partnership, Sunbelt provides an annual contribution of equipment and services to local and national community projects undertaken by the national charitable organisation, Habitat for Humanity.
As well as supporting local communities, A-Plant has also provided input to programmes in Africa.
Over the last two years, together with WH Malcolm Construction Services, we have been working to provide tools and equipment for use in the Rwanda Orphans Project.
We have sent used equipment to a training centre in Rwanda which is designed to enable attendees to learn new skills.
The equipment is being used by orphans aged 17 to 19, to enable them to develop a skill to support themselves and their families.
A-Plant Lux also recently sponsored a BT Apprentice to complete Challenge Africa 2008, the focus of which was to support a school in Kenya with a feeding programme, as well as building teacher accommodation and a water tank.
The project also supported the building of classrooms for a community in Tanzania.

Ashtead Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2008 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements | 57 2 Segmental analysis Business segments The Group operates one class of business: rental of equipment.
Operationally and managerially, the Group is split into two business units, Sunbelt and A-Plant which separately report to, and are managed by, the chief executive and align with the geographies in which they operate, being the US and UK, respectively.
The Group also owns Ashtead Technology, which is in the process of being disposed and therefore has been classi ed as a disposal group refer note 7.
These business units are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The Group manages debt and taxation centrally, rather than by business unit.

Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities and exclude taxation balances, corporate borrowings and accrued interest.
Capital expenditure represents additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and includes additions through the acquisition of businesses.
Segmental analysis by geography The Groups operations are located in North America, the United Kingdom and Singapore.
The following table provides an analysis of the Groups revenue, segment assets and capital expenditure, including acquisitions, by country of domicile.
Segment assets include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

On 23 June 2008, the Group announced that agreement had been reached with Phoenix Equity Partners for the sale of the business for 95.6m.
At 30 April 2008, the Group concluded that, with regard to the criteria set out in IFRS 5, it was highly probable that the business would be sold.
Accordingly, the operations which form a single disposal group, have been classi ed as assets held for sale, which are presented separately in the balance sheet.
The operations are also included as discontinued operations in the segmental analysis in note 2.
The proceeds of disposal substantially exceed the book value of the related net assets and accordingly no impairment losses have been recognised on the classi cations of these operations held for sale.
The results of the discontinued operations which have been included in the consolidated income statement are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Revenue 26.5 21.6 Operating costs 10.2 10.6 EBITDA 16.3 11.0 Depreciation 5.7 4.8 Operating pro t 10.6 6.2 Net nancing costs Pro t before taxation 10.6 6.2 Taxation 3.0 0.2 Pro t after taxation 7.6 6.0 Staff costs included in the above operating costs are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Salaries 4.9 4.1 Social security costs 0.5 0.3 Other pension costs 0.1 0.1 5.5 4.5 Proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment amounted to 1.1m 2007: 0.6m.

a Trade receivables: credit risk The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables and the associated risk management techniques that the Group deploys in order to mitigate this risk are discussed in note 25.
The credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk pro les of, and the invoicing conventions established in, the Groups markets.
The contractual terms on invoices issued to customers vary between the US and the UK in that, invoices issued by A-Plant are payable within 30-60 days whereas, invoices issued by Sunbelt are payable on receipt.
Therefore, on this basis, a signi cant proportion of the Groups trade receivables are contractually past due.
The allowance account for bad and doubtful receivables is calculated based on prior experience re ecting the level of uncollected receivables over the last year within each business.
Accordingly, it is not attributable to speci c receivables and has not been offset against the aged analysis of past due receivables below.

First priority senior secured credit facility The $1.75bn first priority asset based senior secured loan facility ABL facility consists of a $1.5bn revolving credit facility and a $250m term loan and is secured by a first priority interest in substantially all of the Groups assets.
Pricing for the revolver loan is based on the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA before exceptional items according to a grid which varies, depending on leverage, from LIBOR plus 225bp to LIBOR plus 150bp.
At 30 April 2008 the Groups borrowing rate was LIBOR plus 150bp.
The term loan is priced at LIBOR plus 175bp.

The ABL facility includes a springing covenant package under which quarterly financial performance covenants are tested only if available liquidity is less than $125m.
Available liquidity at 30 April 2008 was 299m $592m re ecting drawings under the facility at that date together with outstanding letters of credit of 15.7m $31.1m.
As the ABL facility is asset based, the maximum amount available to be borrowed which includes drawings in the form of standby letters of credit depends on asset values receivables, inventory, rental equipment and real estate which are subject to periodic independent appraisal.
The maximum amount which could be drawn at 30 April 2008 was 883m $1,748m.

At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 15.5m 2007: 11.6m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The ESOT owned directly 4,786,097 of these shares and a further 1,587,285 shares were registered in the name of Performance Share Plan participants on terms which require that the award shares are transferred back to the ESOT to the extent that the performance targets are not met.
The shares had a market value of 3.9m at 30 April 2008.
The ESOT and the plan participants have waived the right to receive dividends on the shares they hold.
The costs of operating the ESOT are borne by the Group but are not signi cant.
The Group has recognised the fair value of share-based payments to employees based on grants of shares since 7 November 2002 the transitional date for IFRS 2, Share-based payments.
Cash Incentive Plan The Cash Incentive Plan CIP is an award of units which are subject to the same performance conditions as apply to the Companys unapproved share option scheme.
Awards were granted under this plan in 2000 and 2001 and are exercisable up to February 2010 and 2011, respectively, as all performance conditions have been satis ed.
On exercise by the option holder, the difference between the mid-market price of Ashtead Group plc shares on that day and the grant prices of 94.09p and 115.31p, for the 2000 and 2001 awards respectively, multiplied by the number of units held will be paid by way of a cash award to the holder, net of applicable taxes.
The fair value of the awards at 30 April 2008 was based on the share price on that date.
Investment Incentive Plan Details of the Investment Incentive Plan IIP are given on page 37.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based upon the fair value of the award at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
There are no awards outstanding under the IIP at 30 April 2008.

The major plans for new employees throughout the Group are all fide ned contribution plans following the introduction of the stakeholder pension plan for UK employees in May 2002.
Pension costs for fide ned contribution plans were 3.9m 2007: 3.6m.
The Group also has a fide ned bene t plan for UK employees which was closed to new members in 2001.
This plan is a funded fide ned bene t plan with trustee administered assets held separately from those of the Group.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 30 April 2007 and updated to 30 April 2008 by a quali ed independent actuary.
The principal assumptions made by the actuary were as follows: 2008 2007 Rate of increase in salaries 4.50% 4.25% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.50% 3.25% Discount rate 6.25% 5.50% In ation assumption 3.50% 3.25% Expected return on plan assets 7.50% 7.40% Pensioner life expectancy assumed in the 30 April 2008 update is based on the PA00 medium cohort mortality tables adjusted so as to apply a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1.5% a year.
Samples of the ages to which pensioners are assumed to live are as follows: Male Female Pensioner aged 65 in 2008 87.9 90.5 Pensioner aged 65 in 2020 89.7 92.2 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Current service cost 0.9 1.1 Interest cost 2.9 2.5 Expected return on plan assets 4.3 3.8 Total income 0.5 0.2 The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2008 2007 m m Fair value of plan assets 55.3 57.6 Present value of fide ned bene t obligation 49.5 52.4 Funded status 5.8 5.2 Effect of the limit on the net asset to be recognised 5.8 Net asset recognised in the balance sheet 5.2 Following the 2007 triennial actuarial valuation of the pension fund, which re ects the requirements of the Pensions Act 2006, the minimum level of annual contributions has increased signi cantly.
Accordingly, under IAS 19, the surplus in the plan can no longer be recognised on the balance sheet as the Company cannot access it directly: rather it has instead been written off through reserves.

25 Financial risk management The Groups trading and nancing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact on current or future earnings.
Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
It is the role of the Group treasury function to manage and monitor the Groups financial risks and internal and external funding requirements in support of the Groups corporate objectives.
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board and monitored by the Finance and Administration Committee.
In particular, the Board of directors or, through delegated authority, the Finance and Administration Committee, approves any derivative transactions.
Derivative transactions are only undertaken for the purposes of managing interest rate risk and currency risk.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Group maintains treasury control systems and procedures to monitor liquidity, currency, credit and financial risks.
The Group reports in sterling and pays dividends in sterling.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to interest rate and currency risk.
Interest rate risk is monitored on a continuous basis and managed, where appropriate, through the use of interest rate swaps whereas the use of forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risk is considered on an individual non-trading transaction basis.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk or equity price risk as fide ned in IFRS 7.
Interest rate risk Management of xed and variable rate debt The Group has xed and variable rate debt in issue with 43% of the drawn debt at a xed rate.
The Groups accounting policy requires all borrowings to be held at amortised cost.
As a result the carrying value of xed rate debt is unaffected by changes in credit conditions in the debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups debt that bears interest at a variable rate comprises all outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility.
The interest rates currently applicable to this variable rate debt are LIBOR as applicable to the currency borrowed US dollars or pounds plus 150bp for revolver borrowings and LIBOR plus 175bp for term borrowings.
The Group periodically utilises interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates.
However, during the year ended and as at 30 April 2008, the Group had no such outstanding swap agreements.
The Group also holds cash and cash equivalents, which earn interest at a variable rate.
Ashtead Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2008 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements | 77 25 Financial risk management continued Net variable rate debt sensitivity At 30 April 2008, based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding, the Groups pre-tax pro ts would change by approximately 6m for each one percentage point change in interest rates applicable to the variable rate debt and equity would change by approximately 4m.
The amount of the Groups variable rate debt may uctuate as a result of changes in the amount of debt outstanding under the revolving tranches of the senior secured credit facility.
Currency exchange risk Currency exchange risk is limited to translation risk as there are no transactions in the ordinary course of business that take place between foreign entities.
The Groups reporting currency is the pound sterling.
However, a majority of our assets, liabilities, revenue and costs is denominated in US dollars.
The Group has arranged its nancing such that approximately 90% of its debt is also denominated in US dollars so that there is a natural partial offset between its dollar-denominated net assets and earnings and its dollar-denominated debt and interest expense.
The Groups exposure to exchange rate movements on trading transactions is relatively limited.
All Group companies invoice revenues in their respective local currency and generally incur expense and purchase assets in their local currency.
Consequently, the Group does not routinely hedge either forecast foreign exchange exposures or the impact of exchange rate movements on the translation of overseas pro ts into sterling.
Where the Group does hedge, it maintains appropriate hedging documentation.
Foreign exchange risk on signi cant non-trading transactions e. g. acquisitions is considered on an individual basis.
Resultant impacts of reasonably possible changes to foreign exchange rates Based upon the level of US operations and of the US dollar-denominated debt balance and US interest rates at 30 April 2008, a 1% change in the US dollar-pound exchange rate would impact our pre-tax pro ts by approximately 0.9m and equity by approximately 2.0m.
At 30 April 2008, the Group had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table.
2008 2007 m m Cash and cash equivalents 1.8 1.1 Trade and other receivables 159.9 163.7 161.7 164.8 The Group has a large number of unrelated customers, serving over 800,000 during the financial year, and does not have any signi cant credit exposure to any particular customer.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the markets they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across the Group, such as the use of credit rating agencies and the maintenance of a credit control function.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience dif culties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group generates signi cant free cash ow fide ned as cash ow from operations less replacement capital expenditure net of proceeds of asset disposals, interest paid and tax paid.
This free cash ow is available to the Group to invest in growth capital expenditure, acquisitions and dividend payments or to reduce debt.
In addition to the strong free cash ow from normal trading activities, additional liquidity is available through the Groups ABL facility.
At 30 April 2008, availability under this facility was $592m 299m.
78 | Ashtead Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2008 | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 25 Financial risk management continued Contractual maturity analysis Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial asset held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity pro le for its non-derivative financial liabilities, excluding trade and other payables which fall due within one year.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.
In order to manage the short and long term capital structure, the Group adjusts the amount of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders, returns capital to shareholders for example, share buy-backs and arranges appropriate nancing to fund business investment and mergers and acquisitions.
The Group seeks to maintain leverage of between 2 to 3 times net debt to EBITDA over the economic cycle.
Fair value of financial instruments Net fair values of derivative financial instruments At 30 April 2008, the Groups embedded prepayment options included within its secured loan notes had a combined fair value of nil 2007: nil.
At 30 April 2008, the Group had no other derivative financial instruments.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities The table below provides a comparison, by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups non-derivative financial assets and liabilities at 30 April 2008.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties and includes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values of financial assets and liabilities.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
