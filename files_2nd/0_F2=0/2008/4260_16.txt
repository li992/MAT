NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2009 1 General information 67 CSR plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on page 105.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 6.
These financial statements are presented in US Dollars because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
These financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
A detailed discussion of going concern is given on page 49 of the Directors Report in the section titled Going Concern.
2 Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year, two interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the period.
These are: IFRIC 11 IFRS2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions, which was early adopted by the Group in 2006, and IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, the adoption of which has not led to any change in the Groups accounting policies.
The Group adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments in advance of its effective date with effect from 30 December 2006.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not yet been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases, had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 1 amended IAS 27 amended Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate IFRS 2 amended Share-based payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations IFRS 3 revised 2008 Business Combinations IAS 1 revised 2007 Presentation of Financial Statements IAS 23 revised 2007 Borrowing Costs IAS 27 revised 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 32 amended IAS 1 amended Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation Improvements of IFRSs May 2008 The directors anticipate that, other than detailed below, the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the Financial Statements of the Group.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 3 revised may have a significant impact on the profit loss before tax and effective tax rate in future years.
The adoption of the standard removes the requirement to adjust goodwill after the normal 12 month period following the business combination, when recognising a deferred tax asset for pre-acquisition losses of an acquired subsidiary in certain circumstances.
As disclosed in note 20, the Group has significant unrecognised tax losses which may become recognisable in future periods after the adoption of this standard.
The Group is reviewing when it will adopt this standard, but notes that at the current time it has yet to be adopted by the European Union, and the earliest date of application is for periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009.
3 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The Financial Statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Financial Statements cover the 53 week period from 29 December 2007 to 2 January 2009: the comparatives are presented for the 52 week period from 30 December 2006 to 28 December 2007.
The Financial Statements are reported on a 52 or 53 week basis to be consistent with the Groups internal reporting.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2009 Continued 3 Accounting policies continued 68 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the Financial Statements of CSR plc the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries drawn up to the dates indicated in the primary financial statements.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the Financial Statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
On acquisition, the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of the acquisition below the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to profit or loss in the period of acquisition.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially measured as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested annually or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
To determine the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, the Group uses discounted projected cash flows based on approved budgets and projections covering a period up to five years and estimates growth rates, terminal growth rates and discount rates specific for the economic environment within which the cash-generating unit is operating.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and delivery has occurred or the service has been provided, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
These criteria are generally met at the time the product is shipped and delivered to the customer and, depending on the delivery conditions, title and risk have passed to the customer and acceptance of the product, when contractually required, has been obtained, or, in cases where such acceptance is not contractually required, when management has established that all aforementioned conditions for revenue recognition have been met and no further post-shipment obligations exist other than obligations under warranty.
Examples of the above-mentioned delivery conditions are Free on Board point of delivery and Costs, Insurance Paid point of delivery, where the point of delivery may be the shipping warehouse or any other point of destination as agreed in the contract with the customer and where title and risk in the goods pass to the customer.
Revenues are recorded net of sales taxes, customer discounts, rebates and similar charges.
For products for which a right of return exists during a defined period, revenue recognition is determined based on the historical pattern of actual returns, or in cases where such information is lacking, revenue recognition is postponed until the return period has lapsed.
Return policies are typically based on customary return arrangements in local markets.
Revenue is shown net of estimated provision for credit notes and returns.
Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recognised as revenues.
A provision for product warranty is made at the time of revenue recognition and reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free of-charge services that will be incurred by the Company with respect to the sold products.
Royalty income, which is generally earned based upon a percentage of sales or a fixed amount per royalty earning product, is recognised upon shipment by the licencee.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 3 Accounting policies continued 69 Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of CSR plc is the US Dollar and this is also the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in currencies other than US Dollars are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks see policy on Hedge Accounting.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts see Financial Instruments policy for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Currency translation differences are recognised directly in equity.
Operating loss profit Operating loss profit is stated before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax payable is based on taxable loss profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences, unused carried forward tax losses and unused carried forward tax credits can be utilised.
However, such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit: investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2009 Continued 3 Accounting policies continued 70 Taxation continued Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Government grants, by means of tax relief for Research and Development expenditure, are recognised as income as qualified expenditures are made.
Property, plant and equipment Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the assets, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following basis: Computer equipment 2 to 3 years Test equipment 2 to 5 years Office equipment 3 years Furniture and fittings 5 years Leasehold improvements minimum lease period Residual values are the estimated amount that the Group would obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
In general residual values are zero or negligible, due to the technical and specialised nature of assets held.
Residual values are reviewed annually.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Costs included are those that directly relate to the construction of the asset.
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Other intangible assets Other intangible fixed assets are stated at cost or fair value for items acquired in business combinations, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
No amortisation is provided on assets in the course of construction.
On other intangible fixed assets, amortisation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or fair value, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Software licences licence term Customer contracts and relationships 3 years Purchased R&D 4 to 10 years Residual values are the estimated amount that the Group would obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost net of any provision for impairment.
Costs included are those that directly relate to the construction or production of the asset.
Amortisation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 3 Accounting policies continued 71 Research and development expenditure Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Groups product development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified such as a new device or software : the project from which the asset arises meets the Groups criteria for assessing technical feasibility: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
After the recognition of an impairment loss, any depreciation or amortisation charge for the asset is adjusted for future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying value, less estimated residual value, on a systematic basis, over its remaining useful life.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the reversal is limited so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the first-in-first-out FIFO method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment or appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs.
Investments consist of money market deposits in USD, GBP and Euros.
Interest income is recorded as it accrues over the period of the investment at rates fixed at the time of inception.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily available convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2009 Continued 3 Accounting policies continued 72 Financial instruments continued Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire: or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
Impairment Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impaired.
Objective evidence of impairment could include significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the counterparty: or default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: or it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction cost.
Subsequently these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest recognised on an effective yield basis.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL Fair value through profit and loss Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL where the financial liability has been designated as FVTPL.
A financial liability may be designated as FVTPL upon initial recognition if: such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise: or the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Groups documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the Group is provided internally on that basis: or it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement permits the entire combined contract asset or liability to be designated FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 33 to the Financial Statements.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of directors, which provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
The Groups policy is to hedge between 75% and 90% of forecast GBP expenditure for the following 11 to 15 months.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 3 Accounting policies continued 73 Financial instruments continued Hedge accounting Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Note 19 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes.
Movements in the hedging reserve in equity are also detailed in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled into profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss.
When the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Provisions Provisions for warranty and returns costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups liability.
Provision is made for onerous contracts at the fair value of the minimum unavoidable lease payments, net of any amounts recoverable from sub-leases.
Share-based payment The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, including share options with non-market based vesting conditions.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
For grants where the options vest in instalments over the vesting period each instalment is treated as a separate grant, which results in the fair value of each instalment being spread across the vesting period of that instalment.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model for the majority of share options in issue.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For certain share options which include TSR related condition the fair value is estimated through the use of a Monte-Carlo simulation.
Employee benefit trust The Group has established an employee benefit trust which is a separately administered trust and is funded by loans from Group companies.
The assets of the trust comprise shares in CSR plc and cash balances.
The Group recognises assets and liabilities of the trust in the consolidated accounts and shares held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The preparation of financial statements requires the directors to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty.
Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions.
The directors constantly re-evaluate these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate.
The directors believe that the following accounting policies are critical due to the degree of estimation required and or the potential material impact they may have on the Groups financial position and performance.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2009 Continued 4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty continued 74 Inventory valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
The level of inventory provisioning required is sensitive to changes in the forecast sales of particular products which is dependent on changes in conditions in the Groups markets.
If changes in actual market conditions are less favourable than those projected, additional inventory provisions may be required: similarly if changes in actual market conditions are more favourable than predicted, the Group may be able to release a proportion of the inventory provision.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets The Group assesses the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets, long-lived assets and goodwill annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable.
Factors considered important, which could trigger an impairment review, include the following: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future results: significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business: and significantly negative industry or economic trends.
This assessment is based upon projections of anticipated discounted future cash flows.
The most significant variables in determining cash flows are discount rates, terminal values, the number of years on which to base the cash flow projections, as well as the assumptions and estimates used to determine the cash inflows and outflows.
The Group determines discount rates to be used based on the risk inherent in the related activitys current business model and industry comparisons.
Terminal values are based on the expected life of products and forecasted life cycle and forecasted cash flows over that period.
While the Group believes that its assumptions are appropriate, such amounts estimated could differ materially from what will actually occur in the future.
In assessing goodwill, these discounted cash flows are prepared at a cash-generating unit level.
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments the Group has identified its operating segments based on the information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
For the purposes of assessing the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units.
Note 13 to the Financial Statements provides further disclosures on the assumptions underlying the impairment review and the allocation of goodwill to cash generating units.
Provisions for returns and warranty claims The Group provides for the estimated cost of returns and product warranties at the time revenue is recognised.
The Groups products are covered by product warranty plans of varying periods, depending on local practices and regulations.
While the Group engages in extensive product quality programmes and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, warranty obligations are affected by actual product failure rates field failure rates and by material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.
The Groups warranty provision is established based upon its best estimates of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date.
As the Group continuously introduces new products which incorporate complex technology, and as local laws, regulations and practices may change, it continues to be difficult to anticipate failure rates, the length of warranty periods and repair costs.
While the Group believes that its warranty provisions are adequate and that the judgements applied are appropriate, the ultimate cost of product warranty could differ materially from estimates.
When the actual warranty cost of products is lower than originally anticipated, the Group releases an appropriate proportion of the provision, and if the warranty cost is higher than anticipated, the Group increases the provision.
Accounting for share-based payments The Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based payments in relation to the accounting for share-based payments in respect of options and share awards granted after 7 November 2002 and which had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Under IFRS 2, the share-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognised as expense over the employees requisite service period.
The fair value of the majority of options granted is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and, behavioural considerations.
The volatility used in the model is based on movements in the Groups share price for a period matching that of the expected term of the options.
The risk-free interest rate used is the implied yield currently available on zero-coupon government issues in the UK, with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option being valued based on the options remaining contractual life and taking into account the effects of expected early exercise.
For certain share awards which include total shareholder return related conditions, the fair value is estimated through the use of a Monte-Carlo simulation.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty continued 75 Accounting for share-based payments continued The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares that are expected to become exercisable.
The estimates of the number of share options and awards that are expected to become exercisable are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
The impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides details on the valuation assumptions made for each grants of share options and awards during the period.
Share options and Taxation In the UK and US the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts treated as compensation on exercise of certain employees share options under each jurisdictions tax rules.
This gives rise to a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases and hence a deferred tax asset is recorded.
This asset is calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future based on the share price at the balance sheet date with the share-based payment expense recorded in the income statement.
If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of share-based payment expense at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings.
No share-based payment expense is recorded in respect of options granted before 7 November 2002.
Nevertheless, tax deductions have arisen and will continue to arise on these options.
The tax effects in relation to these options are recorded directly in equity against retained earnings.
Revenue recognition Sales are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer, continuing managerial involvement usually associated with ownership and effective control have ceased, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
This requires the Group to assess at the point of delivery whether these criteria have been met.
When the Group determines that such criteria have been met, revenue is recognised.
The Group records estimated reductions to revenue for pricing agreements, price protection, other volume based rebates.
Estimated sales adjustments for volume based discount programmes are based largely on shipment information.
Income taxes The Group is subject to the income tax laws of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, principally the United Kingdom.
These laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by taxpayers and tax authorities.
When establishing income tax provisions, we therefore make a number of judgements and interpretations about the application and interaction of these laws.
Changes in these tax laws or our interpretations of these laws and the resolution of future tax audits could significantly impact our effective tax rate and the results of operations in a given period.
The Group estimates its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This process involves estimating its current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are included within the consolidated balance sheet to the extent that we believe they are recoverable.
In recognising deferred tax assets, the Group considers profit forecasts including the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on sales and external market conditions.
Managements judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised where management believes there are sufficient taxable temporary differences or convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available in future to realise deferred tax assets.
Although the deferred tax assets which have been recognised are considered realisable, actual amounts could be reduced if future taxable income is lower than expected.
This can materially affect the Groups reported net income and financial position.
Hedge accounting for financial instruments The financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.
Hedge accounting is used for foreign currency risk exposures and for firm commitments to hedge foreign currency risk exposures.
Managements judgement is required to determine whether a future transaction is probable.
External market data is applied in measuring the hedge effectiveness of financial instruments.
Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Refer to note 33 for details of the hedging relationships as well as the impact of the hedge on the pre-tax profit or loss for the period.

6 Segmental reporting Products and services from which reportable segments derive their revenues The Groups reportable segments are as follows: Cellular Mobile phones, headsets and audio-related Non-cellular PC, Automotive and Consumer applications The Group has identified business segments based on internal reporting within the Group and has chosen to aggregate the Mobile Handsets and Mobile Headsets operating segments as the Cellular reportable segment.
Segment revenues and results The following is an analysis of the Groups revenue and results by reportable segment: Cellular Non-cellular Unallocated Consolidated 53 weeks ended 2 January 2009 $000 $000 $000 $000 Revenue Total segment revenue 552,750 142,115 694,865 Result Underlying operating profit 53,761 11,483 65,244 Operating loss segment result 14,901 9,643 3,257 8,515 Investment income note 5 6,139 6,139 Finance costs note 10 4,075 4,075 Loss before tax 14,901 9,643 1,193 6,451 Underlying operating profit excludes amortisation of acquired intangible assets, the non cash impairment charge of $52.9 million, the restructuring charge of $14.4 million and the adjustment to goodwill of $1.0 million as a result of the recognition of tax losses.
Investment income and finance costs are not allocated to reportable segments for the purposes of reporting to the Groups Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors.
The accounting policies for the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies as described in note 3.
The segment result represents operating loss profit earned by each segment without the allocation of the $3.3 million of hedge ineffectivess as a result of the restructuring and in 2007 the $15.0 million patent dispute settlement.
Costs are allocated to segments based on levels of R&D and marketing activity in the period.
This is the measure reported to the Groups Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.

This goodwill was allocated to a separate cash generating unit that was part of the Cellular reportable segment.
At the time of the acquisitions in 2005 and 2007, the acquired entities included brought forward tax losses.
These were not recognised at the time of the acquisition as it was not considered probable that taxable profit would be available against which these losses could be utilised.
During 2007 and 2008, a deferred tax asset was recognised for some of these losses, related to Clarity Technologies Inc, and NordNav Technologies AB, and, in accordance with IFRS 3, an equivalent adjustment was made to goodwill.
This resulted in a charge of $978,000 2007: $279,000 that was included within administrative expenses.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2 January 2009 28 December 2007 Reportable segment Cash Generating Unit $000 $000 Cellular Mobile Handsets 91,835 129,441 Mobile Headsets 5,795 5,906 Non-cellular Automotive 8,692 8,860 106,322 144,207 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2009 Continued 13 Goodwill continued 82 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Following the annual impairment test which takes place in the fourth quarter of each year, no further impairment of goodwill is required.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, terminal growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to CSR.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on historical information and expectations of future changes in the market.
For all cash generating units the Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flow forecasts for the following four years, based on long range plans.
These long range plans are based on recent reports on the markets we operate in produced by independent analysts.
Management uses this information to produce realistic plans when combined with internal and customer specific information.
A terminal value is included for the period beyond five years from the balance sheet date based on the cash flow in the fifth year and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%.
This terminal growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 9.3% 2007: 9.3%.
The impairment losses of $12.6 million are included within Administrative expenses in the income statement and relate to acquisition-related intangible assets and software licences which have been written off as the result of the Operational Assessment see note 29.
The impairment losses are recorded within the Cellular operating segment note 6.
At 2 January 2009, the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of other intangible assets amounting to $nil 2007:$nil.
The impairment losses of $3.4 million are included within Administrative Expenses in the income statement and relate to tangible assets which have been written down to their recoverable amount as a result of the Operational Assessment note 29.
Their recoverable amount was the fair value of the assets less their costs to sell, being determined by reference to an active market for those assets.
The impairment losses are recorded within the Cellular operating segments note 6.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts within trade receivables of $3,000 2007: $3,000.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
An allowance for credit notes and price adjustments has also been made within trade receivables of $1,902,000 2007: $150,000.
Before accepting any new customers, the Group uses a credit scoring system to assess the potential customers credit quality and define credit limits by customer.
Credit limits and credit quality are regularly reviewed.
It is the policy of the Group to only transact with creditworthy entities to mitigate the risk of default associated with trade receivables.
The Group provides for trade receivables based on amounts estimated as irrecoverable determined by reference to past default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Treasury deposits Treasury deposits represent bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, treasury deposits and trade and other receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is actively managed to limit the associated risk and counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: 2 January 2009 28 December 2007 $000 $000 Total trade receivables 65,243 81,640 Cash and cash equivalents 180,898 193,311 Treasury deposits 81,000 52,065 Derivative financial instruments 696 327,141 327,712 The maximum exposure to credit risk for total trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: 2 January 2009 28 December 2007 $000 $000 Europe 10,815 13,906 USA 11,623 6,540 Asia 41,527 60,438 Other 1,278 756 65,243 81,640 The Groups exposure to credit risk is spread over a number of counterparties and customers, with limited concentrations.
The Groups largest customer accounts for $7.5 million of trade receivables at 2 January 2009 28 December 2007: $18.4 million.

$6.0 million of the past due but not provided trade receivables were received within two weeks of the balance sheet date 2007: $1.9 million.
The Group has standby letters of credit in place to support the overdue balances.
Based on past experience, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due, other than for credit notes or price adjustments.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2 January 2009 28 December 2007 $000 $000 Deferred tax liabilities 4,002 8,208 Deferred tax assets 6,481 7,021 2,479 1,187 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of $126,588,000 2007: $175,564,000 available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of $4,146,000 2007: $7,793,000 of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining $122,442,000 2007:$167,771,000 due to the unpredictability of future profit streams within certain subsidiary entities.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of $34,381,000 2007: $47,819,000 that will expire in 16-18 years.
The figure is lower than prior periods due to a significant change in the GBP to USD exchange rate.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary timing differences related to undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was $22,974,000 2007: $14,754,000.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2009 Continued 26 Reserves continued 90 The share premium account, capital redemption reserve and hedging reserve are not distributable.
The merger reserve arose on the combination of CSR plc and Cambridge Silicon Radio Limited and is not distributable.
The Employee Benefit Trust Reserve represents the cost of shares in CSR plc purchased in the market and held by the CSR plc Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy options under the Groups share option schemes.
Between 18 March 2008 and 25 March 2008, the CSR Employee Benefit Trust purchased 3,222,813 ordinary shares at prices between 3.37 and 3.03.
On 3 May 2007, the CSR Employee Benefit Trust purchased 334,890 ordinary shares at an average price of 7.41 pence per share.
Between 6 June 2007 and 7 June 2007, the CSR Employee Benefit Trust purchased 336,425 ordinary shares at an average price of 7.38 per share.
Between 26 September 2007 and 28 September 2007, the CSR Employee Benefit Trust purchased 795,452 ordinary shares at an average price of 6.24 per share.
The shares acquired by the Trust do not represent Treasury shares for the purposes of the Companies Act and therefore remain as issued share capital.
For accounting purposes, the treatment of the shares acquired by the Trust is different.
In preparing the consolidated CSR plc Group accounts, the shares held by the Trust are treated as a deduction in shareholders equity.

CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 29 Impairment of assets 91 During 2008, a non-cash impairment charge of $52.9 million was recorded.
This resulted from the decision to discontinue investment in UbiNetics protocol software development programme following the recommendations of the Operational Assessment.
During the Assessment, the Group looked at its market in great detail and consulted widely to review the opportunities for winning the global market for wireless solutions.
The Group undertook in-depth discussions with customers on all continents, and asked the leading customers where they anticipated the most growth.
The Group also carried out an analysis of its own capabilities and identified strengths and weaknesses to determine future strategy.
The impairment is charged to administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
30 Restructuring In October 2008, CSR plc announced a restructuring programme, with the aim of reducing ongoing operating expenses by around $20 million in 2009.
This has been successfully completed, and is expected to deliver the predicted savings.
Approximately 100 employees left the Group as part of the restructuring programme spread through all functions mostly in the UK, US and Sweden.
A one time restructuring charge of $14.4 million was recorded, including $5.6 million of severance, $3.3 million of currency hedging charges due to the reduction in Sterling requirements in 2009 and $3.9 million of onerous lease and building-related charges for buildings being vacated as part of the restructuring.
At the balance sheet date, there were no payments remaining to be made to employees under the restructuring programme: cash outflows relating to the onerous leases of building being vacated are expected to occur over the next two years.
31 Share-based payments CSR plc has grants and awards in the following Share Schemes which result in charges to the Income Statement: Global share option scheme The Company has a share option scheme for all employees of the Group, under which share options were issued prior to flotation, at a price based on the most recent private funding round.
All employees were granted options on joining CSR.
These options have a vesting period of five years, with 20% of options vesting one year after grant, then the remainder vesting in equal quarterly instalments over the remaining four years.
Other options in addition to those related to employees joining were also granted under this scheme.
In all cases if the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
No grants have been made under this scheme since flotation.
Company Share Option Plan CSOP The Company introduced a new scheme at flotation called the CSR plc Share Option Plan.
The following grants have been made under the scheme: Flotation grant On the Companys flotation in February 2004, the Company issued share options to all employees, at a price based on the share price on the day of flotation.
The vesting period is three years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
Performance grants On the Companys flotation in February 2004, and in May 2005, May 2006, May 2007, June 2008 and certain other dates relating to employees joining the Company issued share options at a price based on the average share price over the preceding three days.
The vesting period of these grants is three years and vesting is dependent upon meeting certain EPS based performance conditions.
Starter Grants The Company grants options to new starters to assist in recruitment.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average share price on the three days preceding the grant date.
The vesting period of the options is over a period of five years with 40% vesting after two years and 5% vesting each quarter thereafter.
Grants are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
The Company has also issued starter grants to senior employees that vest after three years.
CSR Share Award Plan In May 2005, following approval of shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting, the Company introduced the CSR plc Share Award Plan, which allows for options to be granted for exercise at a future date at a price equivalent to the nominal value of the Companys shares of 0.001.
The following awards have been made: Retention Awards The Company issues certain employees with rights to purchase shares at nominal value 0.001 as a method of staff retention.
The vesting period of these share awards is either two or three years.
If the share awards remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the awards lapse.
Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2009 Continued 31 Share-based payments continued 92 CSR Share Award Plan continued Performance awards The Company issues certain employees with rights to purchase shares at nominal value 0.001 as a method of staff incentivisation.
The vesting period of these share awards is three years.
The vesting of the awards is also subject to the Group satisfying two performance conditions.
The first is the Total Shareholder Return of the Companys shares when compared to a group of companies selected at the time an award is first granted.
The second is improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group.
In order for the shares to vest, the Group must have met or exceeded certain TSR thresholds when compared with the TSR performance of the group of other companies.
In the event the Group satisfies any one of the TSR thresholds, the Remuneration Committee then considers the extent of any improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Starter awards The Company grants rights to new starters to purchase shares at nominal value 0.001 to assist recruitment.
The vesting period of these awards is two years.
SAYE schemes The Company operates a SAYE scheme, whereby employees are allowed to subscribe to a monthly savings amount for a period of three years: at the end of the three year period, the employee is allowed to either receive their saved amount plus interest or purchase shares in the Company at a price based on the average share price on the three days prior to commencement of the SAYE scheme, discounted by 20%.
This scheme is open to all employees subject to Inland Revenue approved limits on total investment, and invitations are issued at regular intervals.
Employees have a period of six months following the conclusion of the scheme to exercise their option to purchase shares.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows: 53 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 2 January 2009 28 December 2007 Weighted Weighted average average Number of exercise price Number of exercise price share options in share options in Outstanding at beginning of period 8,726,947 3.62 9,225,832 2.96 Granted during the period 3,279,870 1.94 2,260,514 5.20 Forfeited during the period 1,232,681 5.17 892,031 1.21 Exercised during the period 817,245 0.95 1,867,368 1.56 Outstanding at the end of the period 9,956,891 3.12 8,726,947 3.62 Exercisable at the end of the period 5,671,192 3.63 3,579,373 1.38 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 3.56.
The options outstanding at 2 January 2009 had a weighted average exercise price of 3.12, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of nine years.
In 2008, options were granted on 5 March, 28 March, 11 June, 4 August, 12 August, 25 September and 4 November.
The aggregate estimated fair value of the options granted on those dates is $9,504,000.
The weighted average fair value of these options was $3.01.
In 2007, options were granted on 28 February, 28 March, 9 May, 5 June, 1 August, 14 November and 10 December.
The aggregate estimated fair value of the options granted on those dates is $10,567,000.
The weighted average fair value of these options was $5.25.
The fair values of the share option and share award grants were based on the following inputs: The inputs to the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 53 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 2 January 2009 28 December 2007 Weighted average share price 3.24 6.40 5.89 Weighted average exercise price 2.53 5.84 5.16 Expected volatility 54% 50% 51% Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk free rate 4.32% 4.93% 4.72% Expected dividends 0% 0% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over a three year period, equivalent to the vesting period of the options.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Retention awards and starter awards The fair value was based upon the share price on the date of grant.
Performance awards The fair value was based upon Monte-Carlo simulation of the performance of the 38 comparator companies included in the TSR conditions of the award.
Expected volatility for each Company was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the individual Companys share price over the three years from the date of grant.
Share option charges The Group recognised total expenses of $7,586,000 2007: $9,275,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.

Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2009 Continued 33 Financial instruments continued 94 Financial risk management continued The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Capital risk management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
CSR intends to reinvest its cash balances in the business either through higher levels of investment in working capital and fixed assets or through further M&A activity to support the long-term ambitions of the Group.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, treasury deposits and equity attributable to the equity holders of CSR plc, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 25 and 26.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
As a result of the funds raised through the initial public offering in March 2004 and the subsequent positive operating cash flows, the Group has a total of $261.9 million of treasury deposits and cash and cash equivalents as at 2 January 2009 2007: $245.4 million.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 3 to the Financial Statements.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Market risk exposures are mesured using sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management Substantially all of the Groups sales and costs of sales are denominated in US Dollars, the Groups functional currency.
A majority of the Groups fixed costs are denominated in Sterling.
This exposure to different currencies would result in gains or losses with respect to movements in foreign exchange rates and the impact of such fluctuations could be material.
Accordingly, the Group enters into hedging transactions pursuant to which it purchases Sterling under forward purchase contracts in order to cover the majority of its Sterling exposure.
The carrying amounts of the Groups Sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 2 January 2009 28 December 2007 2 January 2009 28 December 2007 000 000 000 000 GBP Sterling 9,092 9,051 3,833 7,669 The following significant exchange rates applied during the period: Weighted average forward contract rate contracts maturing in the period Period end spot rate US Dollars 2 January 2009 28 December 2007 2 January 2009 28 December 2007 GBP 1.9830 1.8877 1.4521 1.9905 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 33 Financial instruments continued 95 Market risk continued Foreign currency sensitivity analysis A ten percent strengthening of the US Dollar against GBP Sterling would have decreased equity and profit or increased loss after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given current market conditions.
Although fluctuations in the US Dollar to GBP Sterling rate have been significantly greater than this percentage in the reporting period, management believes ten percent is likely to be representitve of future movements.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2007.

A thirty percent strengthening of the US Dollar against GBP Sterling as at 2 January 2009 would result in a $16.9 million decrease in equity and a $2.7 million increase in loss for the period.
Although Management believes a ten percent movement is the most representative movement in the US Dollar to GBP Sterling rate, given market conditions a thirty percent movement has been shown to aid understanding of the Groups market risk.
The movement in profit for the period is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to exchange movements in Sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
The movement in equity is mainly as a result of the changes in fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Forward foreign exchange contracts The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flows associated with derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected to occur: Carrying Expected cash More than Amount flows 3 months or less 3-6 months 6-12 months one year Cash flow hedges $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 2 January 2009 Forward foreign exchange contracts $000 29,597 120,979 31,602 30,752 53,319 5,306 Forward foreign exchange contracts 000 63,500 16,000 16,000 28,000 3,500 28 December 2007 Forward foreign exchange contracts $000 384 178,628 35,853 35,636 71,568 35,571 Forward foreign exchange contracts 000 90,090 18,090 18,000 36,000 18,000 The Directors consider the periods in which the cash flows associated with the derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected to occur approximates the periods when the cash flows associated with those cash flows are likely to impact profit or loss.
Interest rate risk management The Group has no significant direct exposure to fluctuations in interest rates other than those on interest-bearing cash balances.
The majority of cash balances are held at fixed rates of interest and the effective rate of interest on those cash balances in the period was 4.67% 2007: 5.16%.
Credit risk Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Group only transacts with entities that are rated the equivalent of investment grade and above.
This information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and if not available, the Group uses other publicly financial available information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
For cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits, the Company only transacts with entities that are equivalent to investment grade and above.
Disclosures related to the credit risk associated with trade receivables are in note 18.
