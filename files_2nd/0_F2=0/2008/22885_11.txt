Significant accounting policies a Statement of Compliance The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
Applicable new standards and interpretations not yet effective IAS 8 requires disclosure of any impending change in accounting policy when an entity has yet to implement a new Standard or Interpretation that has been issued but not yet come into effect.
In addition, it requires disclosure of known or reasonably estimable information relevant to assessing the possible impact that application of the new Standard or Interpretation will have on the entitys financial statements in the period of initial application.
The following new Standards have been issued but are not effective for the year ending 31 December 2008 and have not been adopted: In November 2006, the IASB issued IFRS 8 Operating Segments which becomes effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This standard requires disclosures on the financial performance of the operating segments of the entity.

The Company has decided not to adopt the standard until its effective date.
IAS 32 amendment, Financial instruments: presentation and consequential amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial instruments, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The objective of the standard is to enhance financial statement users understanding of the significance of financial instruments to an entitys financial position, performance, and cash flows.

Significant accounting policies continued b Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency, rounded to the nearest pound.
They are prepared on a fair value basis for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and derivative financial instruments.
Other financial assets and financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Certain figures in the Income Statement and the Cashflow have been reclassified but this has no effect on net result or on cashflow.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements: c Revenue recognition Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Income distributions from investment funds are recognised in the income statement as dividend income when declared.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss i Classification The Company designates all of its investments upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis.
These include financial assets that are not held for trading purposes and which may be sold and represent a group of financial assets which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the group is provided internally on that basis to the entitys key management personnel.
These are principally investments in unlisted open-ended hedge funds.
Financial instruments held for trading include forward foreign currency deals awaiting settlement.
Financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables include sales awaiting settlement and other receivables.
Financial liabilities that are not at fair value through profit or loss include purchases awaiting settlement, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
The table in Note 3 details the categories of financial assets and liabilities held by the Company at the reporting date.
ii Recognition The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities on the date it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A regular way purchase and sale of financial instruments is recognised using trade date accounting.
From this date any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities are recorded.
27 DEXION ABSOLUTE LIMITED 2008 REPOR T & ACCOUNTS 2.
Significant accounting policies continued e Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss continued iii Measurement Financial instruments are measured initially at fair value transaction price.
Transaction costs on financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are expensed immediately.
Subsequent to initial recognition, all instruments classified as fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with changes in their fair value recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less impairment losses, if any.
Financial liabilities, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
iv Fair value measurement principles Investments in underlying funds which are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange or other trading facility will be valued at the NAVs provided by such entities or their administrators.
These values may be unaudited or may themselves be estimates.
In addition, these entities or their administrators may not provide values at all or in a timely manner and, to the extent that values are not available, those investments will be valued by the Investment Adviser using valuation techniques appropriate to those investments.
In determining fair value, the Investment Adviser takes into consideration, where applicable, the impact of suspensions, of redemptions, liquidation proceedings, investments in side pockets and other significant factors.
Open forward foreign currency contracts at the balance sheet date are valued at forward currency rates at that point.
The unrealised appreciation or depreciation on open forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by reference to the difference between the contracted rate and the rate to close out the contract.
v Realised and unrealised gains and losses Realised gains and losses arising on disposal of investments are calculated by reference to the proceeds received on disposal and the average cost attributable to those investments, and are recognised in the income statement.
Unrealised gains on investments are recognised in the income statement.
vi Impairment Financial assets that are stated at cost or amortised cost are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.
If any such indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's effective interest rate.
If in a subsequent period the amount of an impairment loss recognised on a financial asset carried at amortised cost decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the write-down, the writedown is reversed through the income statement.
vii Derecognition The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.
The Company uses First in First out method to determine the gain or loss on derecognition.

Significant accounting policies continued f Foreign currency transactions The financial statements of the Company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates its functional currency.
The Directors have considered the primary economic currency of the Company and considered the currency in which the original capital was raised, distributions are to be made and ultimately the currency capital would be returned on a break up basis.
The Directors have also considered the currency to which the underlying investments are exposed.
On balance, the Directors believe that pounds sterling best represents the functional currency.
For the purpose of the financial statements the results and financial position of the Company are expressed in sterling which is the presentation currency of the Company.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised gains or losses on currency translation are recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency differences relating to investments at fair value through profit or loss are included in gains and losses on investments note 3. g Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents, which include bank overdrafts, are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant changes in value.
Cash, deposits with banks and bank overdrafts are stated at their principal amount.
h Issue costs Expenses associated with the issue of ordinary shares other than those arising on the issue or conversion of C shares are borne exclusively by the shareholders of ordinary shares.
These expenses, when incurred, are written off against share premium.
During the year, issue costs associated with the issue of ordinary shares amounted to 1,342,025. i Treasury Shares Where the Company purchases its own share capital whether into treasury or for cancellation, the consideration paid, which includes any directly attributable costs net of income taxes is recognised as a deduction from equity shareholders funds through the special reserve, which is a distributable reserve.
When such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is recognised as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to from the special reserve.
Shares held in treasury are not taken into account in determining NAV per share detailed in Note 8 and earnings per share detailed in Note 11.

Financial Risk Management The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective through investment in an actively managed portfolio of hedge funds, diversified by investment strategy, style and manager, in order to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, with little correlation to equity and fixed interest benchmarks.
The techniques and instruments utilised for the purposes of efficient portfolio management are those which are reasonably believed by the Investment Adviser to be economically appropriate to the efficient management of the Company.
The Companys financial instruments include cash and currency hedging.
30 DEXION ABSOLUTE LIMITED 2008 REPOR T & ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 4.
Financial Risk Management continued The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to moderate certain risk exposures.
a Market price risk management Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
Price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents both gains and losses suffered through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations which are monitored by the Investment Adviser in pursuance of its investment objective and policy.
Adherence to the Companys investment restrictions set out on page 13 and 14 in the Directors Report mitigates the risk of excessive exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio at the balance sheet date are disclosed in summary form in the Managers Report.
Details of the nature and terms of derivative financial instruments outstanding at the balance sheet date are set out in note 12.
If the price of the underlying hedge funds increased decreased by 10% the NAV of the Company would increase decrease by 142,501,560 2007: 138,122,230.
Actual trading results may differ from the above sensitivity analysis and these differences may be material.
b Interest rate risk management Substantially all of the Companys assets are non-interest bearing investments and its exposure to interest rate changes is limited.
The Company, however, has a bank overdraft of 242,947,995 2007: 108,652,524 at the year end and is therefore subject to cashflow interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
The short term investments included within cash equivalents and bank overdraft have an overnight maturity, and as a result they have a limited exposure to fair value interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
The following table details the Companys exposure to interest rate risks.
It includes the Companys assets and liabilities at fair values, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity date measured by the carrying value of the assets and liabilities.

Financial Risk Management continued b Interest rate risk management continued Except for the bank overdraft noted above, the Company has no significant financial liabilities other than short term creditors arising directly from its investing activities.
The Company started 2008 with a facility agreement with Northern Trust Guernsey Limited for up to the lower of 305 million and 20% of its net assets for short-term or temporary liquidity purposes as may be necessary to facilitate investment and withdrawals from underlying funds or to meet ongoing expenses, and to implement the Companys currency hedging strategy.
This facility agreement was temporarily increased to the lower of 404 million and 30% of its net assets with effect from 4 November 2008 and this temporary extension expired on 31 January 2009.
From 1 February 2009 the facility was reduced to up to the lower of 220 million and 20% of its net assets, on a rolling basis with three months notice.
Interest on all amounts accrue at a rate of 0.75% per annum, and 1.25% for the temporary increase in facility, above the official rates applicable to the Company from time to time.
This facility is secured against the Companys investments.
As at 24 April 2009 there was no draw-down on the facility.

A decrease of 100 basis points would have had an equal and opposite effect.

Financial Risk Management continued c Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
Credit risk is generally higher when a non-exchange traded financial instrument is involved because the counterparty for non-exchange traded financial instruments is not backed by an exchange clearing house.
The Company is also exposed to credit risk on the financial assets with its brokers.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
This relates also to financial assets carried at amortised cost, as they have a short-term to maturity.
At the reporting date, the Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following: 2008 2007 Financial assets at fair value 1,425,015,599 1,381,222,302 Cash and cash equivalents 798,124 100,194,446 Forward currency contracts 2,129,287 Balances due from broker 12,205,699 763,054 Other receivables 64,663 748,159 Total 1,438,084,085 1,485,057,248 Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are usually with counterparties with whom the Company has signed master netting agreements.
Master netting agreements provide for the net settlement of contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default.
Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the short settlement period involved and the credit quality of the brokers used.
Investments made by the Company and the funds in which it invests may not be regulated by the rules of any stock exchange or investment exchange or other regulatory body or authority.
The counterparties to such investments have no obligation to make markets in such investments.
Furthermore, the Company will be subject to the risk of bankruptcy of, or the inability or refusal to perform with respect to such investments by, the counterparties with which the Company deals.
The Investment Adviser carries out due diligence procedures before investing in an underlying managers fund.
Procedures are also in place to monitor the managers on a regular basis, thereby ensuring that the Company limits its exposure to credit risk on its underlying funds.
The Company monitors the credit rating and financial positions of the brokers used to further mitigate this risk.
Substantially all of the assets of the Company are held by Northern Trust Guernsey Limited.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the Custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the Custodian to be delayed or limited.
The Company monitors its risk by monitoring the credit quality and financial position of the Custodian.
All of the cash held by the Company is held by the Custodian and certain other financial institutions.
Bankruptcy or insolvency by the Custodian and financial institutions may cause the Companys rights with respect to the cash held by the Custodian and financial institutions to be delayed or limited.
The Company monitors its risk by monitoring the credit rating of the Custodian.
If the credit quality or the financial position of the Custodian deteriorates significantly the Investment Adviser may move the cash holdings to another bank.
The credit rating of the Northern Trust Corporation at the year end was AA 2007: AAper Standard and Poors.
The Companys Investment Adviser analyses credit concentration based on the counterparty of the financial assets that the Company holds.
Details of the Companys ten largest holdings at 31 December 2008 are detailed in the Managers Report on page 10.
The Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk were concentrated in the following industries: 2008 2007 %% Banks 0.06 6.75 Hedge Funds 99.09 93.00 Other 0.85 0.25 Total 100.00 100.00 33 DEXION ABSOLUTE LIMITED 2008 REPOR T & ACCOUNTS 4.
Financial Risk Management continued d Currency risk The Company may invest in financial instruments and enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than its functional currency.
Consequently the Company is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its currency relative to other foreign currencies may change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion of the Companys assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The Companys operating activities include investing in derivative financial instruments that involve varying degrees of currency risk.
The derivative contracts that the Company holds from time to time are forward contracts on foreign currencies for hedging non-sterling share classes and an index option.
The Company had no forward foreign exchange contract in place as at 31 December 2008.
Details of forward contracts on foreign currencies and the index options held at 31 December 2007 are set out in note 12.
The Companys currency risk is managed on a daily basis by the Investment Adviser in accordance with policies and procedures in place as outlined in the prospectus of the fund.
The Companys overall currency positions and exposures are monitored on a quarterly basis by the Directors.
The following table sets out the Companys total net exposure to foreign currency risk and the net exposure to foreign currencies of the assets and liabilities: Forward FX Net Assets Liabilities Contracts Exposure At 31 December 2008 Australian dollar 672 90,139 89,466 Euro 356,253 356,253 US dollar 1,436,892,226 242,319,961 1,194,572,265 At 31 December 2007 Australian dollar 584,241 1,542,555 41,805,957 40,847,643 Euro 1,698,803 4,184,629 160,127,602 157,641,776 US dollar 1,457,478,099 61,600,004 1,245,842,080 150,036,015 Amounts in the above table are based on the carrying value of monetary assets and liabilities and the underlying principal amount of foreign currency contracts.
Sensitivity Analysis At 31 December 2008, had the pound sterling strengthened by 5% in relation to the above currencies, with all other variables held constant, net assets attributable to shareholders and the change in net assets attributable to shareholders per the income statement would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2007.

Financial Risk Management continued e Liquidity risk management The Company may not be able to liquidate quickly some of its investments in instruments at an amount close to their fair value in order to meet liquidity requirements.
At 31 December 2008, approximately 35.2% had expected liquidity within 3 months, 18.8% between 3 and 6 months and 46% 12 months plus.
Of the 46% at 12 months plus, approximately 12.9% was invested in underlying funds that had gated or suspended realisations and 4.8% was invested in designated investments or sidepockets.
From time to time, the counterparties with which the Company effects transactions might cease making markets or quoting prices in certain of the instruments.
In such instances, the Company might be unable to enter into a desired transaction in currencies or other financial instruments, or to enter into any offsetting transaction with respect to an open position, which might adversely affect its performance.
Similarly, it may not always be possible for the Company to execute a buy or sell order on exchanges at the desired price or to liquidate an open position either due to market conditions or due to the operation of daily price fluctuation limits the maximum fluctuation permitted by some exchanges in the price of a futures or options contract during any trading day.
If trading on an exchange is suspended or restricted, the Company may not be able to execute trades or close out positions on terms which the Investment Adviser believes are desirable.
The Investment Adviser manages liquidity risk in accordance with the Companys investment restrictions, its committed facilities that include provision for settlement timing mismatches and also have access to the Custodian position reports by an on-line system.
Upon raising fresh capital, the Manager seeks to arrange increased facilities as required.
On a quarterly basis or more frequently, if deemed appropriate the Board reviews and considers the overall liquidity risk of the portfolio.
The Company started 2008 with a combined overdraft and foreign exchange facility with Northern Trust Guernsey Limited of up to a maximum of 305 million or 20% of Net Value of Assets in custody whichever is the lower.
The facility was temporarily increased from 4 November 2008 to the lower of 404 million and 30% of net assets.
This temporary increase expired on 31 January 2009.
From 1 February 2009, the facility was reduced to the lower of 220 million or 20% of net assets.
The facility may be used for purposes that include funding share repurchases and redemptions.
