3 Net fair value losses gains on assets at fair value through income 2008 2007 '000 '000 Fair value losses gains on investments 2,505 869 The above fair value adjustment represents gains and losses, both realised and unrealised, on financial assets held for trading which have been recognised in revenue.
Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 75 Notes to the Accounts continued 4 Other operating income 2008 2007 '000 '000 Other operating income comprises the following items: Gain on disposal of property 4,129 Gains on disposal of significant investments 7,892 Gains on disposal of subsidiaries and contracts 775 Exceptional gains 4,129 8,667 Gain on disposal of other investments 724 3,440 Other operating income 4,853 12,107 2008 The gain on disposal of property relates to the sale of a building acquired as part of the DEGI transaction.
The premium over the fair value on acquisition was achieved as a result of subsequent changes in the tenancy arrangements of the property and in the identification of a strategic purchaser.
The board considers this gain to be outwith the course of the Groups normal business and sufficiently material that it should be disclosed separately to enable a proper understanding of the financial statements and has therefore chosen to disclose this item as an exceptional gain.
The gain on disposal of other investments comprises principally net gains realised on the disposal of private equity investments.
2007 The gains on significant investments represent the final contingent deferred consideration received in respect of the sale, in January 2005, of the Groups investment in Lombard International Assurance SA.
The gain includes the transfer of 7.0 million from the available for sale reserve.
The gain on disposal of subsidiaries and contracts comprises deferred proceeds received in the current year in respect of disposals completed in previous years.
The board considers that these two categories of gains are outwith the course of the Groups normal business and sufficiently material that they should be disclosed separately to enable a proper understanding of the financial statements, and has therefore chosen to disclose these items as exceptional gains.
Gains on disposal of other investments comprises principally net gains on the disposal of private equity investments.
5 Exceptional costs Exceptional costs include rationalisation and redundancy costs related to acquisitions completed during the year, an impairment charge in respect of a seed capital investment and non-recurring costs incurred in implementing a cost reduction programme.
The exceptional provision for vAT on investment trusts represents vAT which may be repayable to the Groups uK investment trust clients following conclusion of an action brought against HMRC by a uK investment trust.
The amount of this provision is an estimate of the costs which may arise in respect of historic periods in excess of the amount to be recovered from HMRC.
The exceptional impairment provision arose from the decision to discontinue marketing a proposed property fund in order to focus attention on completion and integration of the DEGI transaction.
As a result of this decision, the fair value of this fund was considered to be impaired because of the accelerated recognition of future costs arising from this portfolio.
Exceptional costs incurred in 2007 relate to the acquisition of certain fund management businesses of Deutsche Asset Management in late 2005 and integrating them with the existing businesses of the Group.
These integration costs comprised charges in respect of a transitional services agreement with the vendor to ensure that both people and systems were transferred in a controlled manner: set up costs in respect of the migration of the back office data and systems to the Groups third party administrator: and costs of retaining duplicate staffing for a transitional period to ensure a smooth migration of data.

The Company made no admission whatsoever of any liability or acceptance of the validity of REO's claim, but the board recognised that it was in the interests of the Group and its shareholders to conclude this matter and to end the distraction it was causing to the Company.
The net cost to the Group, including the Groups legal costs and after return of the defence payment of 7,500,000 made in 2006, was 46,776,000.

Factors affecting future tax charge The Groups overseas profits are subject to overseas tax rates some of which are lower than the standard rate of uK corporation tax 28% 2007: 30%.
The tax benefit of lower tax rates is only one of timing to the extent that these overseas profits are subsequently remitted to the uK.
Additionally, the Group will be able to benefit from the offset of tax losses brought forward from prior years against its taxable profits for the next 3 years.

This payment will trigger an adjustment to the subscription price applying to the warrants which form part of the 6.75% Convertible Preference Share units issued in June 2005.
Assuming approval of the final dividend payment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the subscription price will reduce from 97p per ordinary share to 94p per ordinary share.
Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 81 Notes to the Accounts continued 13 Earnings per share The calculations of earnings per share are based on the following profits and numbers of shares.
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive shares into ordinary shares.
underlying earnings per share figures are calculated by adjusting the net profit to exclude exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets.
The purpose of providing the underlying earnings per share is to allow readers of the accounts to clearly consider trends without the impact of exceptional and non-cash items.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the most appropriate CGu.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets attributable to each segment is as follows: Group Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 '000 '000 '000 '000 Investment management 623,295 606,040 26,682 25,652 Property asset management 205,166 13,647 828,461 619,687 26,682 25,652 The recoverable amount of each CGu is determined by value-in-use calculations which use cash flow projections based on the Groups latest approved budgets which cover the 2008 09 financial year.
These budgets were prepared taking into account the market conditions prevailing at the time.
The long term cash flow projections extrapolate the 2008 09 budget figures over ten years with assumptions made on revenue, market growth and increases in overheads to cover inflation and increased levels of business.
Revenue is assumed to increase at a rate based on the Groups recent experience of new business inflows.
Equity assets under management 'AuM' are assumed to increase by 6% 2007: 6% per annum and fixed income AuM by 3% 2007: 3% per annum to reflect general market performance and or reinvestment of income by clients.
Increases in operating costs have been factored in at existing rates to cover assumed new business volumes and an allowance of 3% 2007: 3% per annum has been made for general inflation of costs.
To arrive at a net present value the cash flows are discounted using the weighted average cost of capital for each CGu which has been calculated at 10.5% 2007: 10.5% for investment management and 14% 2007: 12.3% for property asset management at 30 September 2008.
The value-in-use is estimated by calculating a terminal value and adding this to the net present value of the cash flows.
This overall value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets in order to assess whether any impairment exists.
The board considers the terminal value fairly reflects the long term nature of the business and there is no reason to believe that the business will not continue in the long term.
The impairment review included a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections and the rate at which the projections were discounted to arrive at the final value-in-use.
The sensitivity analysis included testing assumptions relating to future revenue growth and the assumptions surrounding the level of operating margins.
The review also covered management contracts in respect of open end funds which are considered to have indefinite lives and are therefore not subject to amortisation.
These assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets revealed a surplus in value-in-use over book value for both CGus and therefore no impairment charge is required.

The fair value of the unlisted available for sale investments has been estimated using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by observable market prices or rates.
The directors believe that the estimated fair values resulting from the valuation technique which are recorded in the balance sheet, and the related fair value gains recorded in the income statement, are reasonable and most appropriate at the balance sheet date.

The fair value of unlisted investments have been valued in accordance with International Private Equity and venture Capital valuation guidelines for Limited Partnership agreements where possible.
Interest bearing loans The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The valuations have considered similar issues available in the market and the liquidity of the assets and liabilities.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated cash flows are based on management's best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the balance sheet date.

Interest on the revolving credit facility is at a variable rate of 1.1% above LIBOR and on the overdraft at the variable rate of 1% over base rate.
Further details of the liabilities are given in note 28.
They principally comprise available for sale investments and assets and other debtors.
The floating rate financial assets principally comprise cash and deposit balances which earn interest at rates which fluctuate according to money market rates.
Foreign net investment The majority of the Groups subsidiaries use sterling as their functional and presentation currencies.
The foreign currency net monetary assets of subsidiaries which adopt a different reporting currency are as follows: 2008 2007 '000 '000 uS dollar 13,459 28,963 Singapore dollar 63,162 61,255 Australian dollar 6,195 11,692 Nordic currencies 75,662 13,204 Euro 14,480 1,274 Other 11,218 6,693 Financial instruments relating to unit linked contracts The Groups life assurance subsidiary provides unit linked wrappers which avail clients of a number of benefits from these pooled arrangements.
From the Groups perspective, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management as the financial risks and rewards attributable to theses assets also fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact of the level of the fees which are earned from this entity which are directly impacted by the underlying value of the policyholder assets.
While by necessity this Group subsidiary company has some insurance risks, these risks are completely reinsured, thereby negating any ultimate insurance risk to the Groups equity holders.
The unit linked assets are matched by the associated insurance contract liabilities disclosed in note 20.
The assets above are all unit linked and held for the sole benefit of the policyholders within Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited.
Investment and credit risk in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit linked funds is borne by the policyholders.

Following a decision of the European Court of Justice on certain questions referred by the uK vAT Tribunal, HMRC announced on 26 October 2007 that would no longer seek to defend this case.
A number of the Groups uK subsidiaries, in common with other uK asset managers, now face claims from investment trust clients for the repayment of vAT previously charged for periods back to 1990.
The Group charged vAT in accordance with applicable legislation at the time, but provision has been recognised to the extent that payments to investment trusts are expected to exceed the amounts recoverable from HMRC.
The provision of 2 million represents the estimated net cost to the Group.
Significant uncertainty remains as to the final quantification of amounts recoverable from HMRC and amounts payable to investment trusts.
Also uncertainty remains over the methodology to be adopted by HMRC and the timing of such payments.

The board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and ongoing management of the Groups risk management framework and the implementation and operation of the board's policies are handled by the Groups risk management committee.
The Groups audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Internal audit assist the Group audit committee in its oversight role by undertaking both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures and report the results of these reviews directly to the audit committee.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees are involved and understand their roles and obligations.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to pay in full amounts when due, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
Debt levels are monitored locally by senior management and historically the level of default has not been significant and in the majority of cases there is an ongoing relationship with the client.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a significantly increased cost.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of it's holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Interest on the Groups borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily Sterling, Euro and uS dollars.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.
The Groups investment in its uS subsidiary is hedged by the Groups uS dollar 7.2% Subordinated notes 2016, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the subsidiary's net assets.
The Groups investments in other subsidiaries are not hedged as those currency positions are considered to be long-term in nature.
Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities.
These securities are managed on a individual basis and all buy and sell decisions are approved by the Group management board.
unit-linked assets The Groups balance sheet contains a significant level of assets relating to the Groups life and pensions subsidiary for which the risks and rewards fall to the benefit of or are borne by the underlying policyholders.
Therefore the investment contract liabilities shown in the Groups balance sheet are equal and opposite in value to the assets held on behalf of the policyholders.
As a result the Group has no direct exposure to fluctuations in the value of assets which are held on behalf of policyholders.
The Groups exposure in relation to these assets lies in the revenue earned from the assets which varies in line with the movement in value of the assets.
The Group has no exposure to fluctuations in the value of the assets arising from changes in market prices or credit default.
110 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 37 Financial risk management continued stock of units and shares These represent units and shares of Open Ended Investment Companies OEIC's which are operated and managed by the Group.
These are funds into which both institutional and retail investors can invest and the Group maintains a stock of units and shares in these funds in order to facilitate the creation and redemption of units by investors.
The Groups risk management committee has set specific limits for the overall value of units which can be held by the Group at any one time and also placed a limit on the value of units held in any single fund.
trade debtors and accrued income Trade debtors and accrued income represent amounts recognised in revenue in the Group income statement which have not been settled by clients.
The majority of the Groups asset management fees accrue based on daily, month-end or quarter-end asset values except performance fees which typically are earned based on annual performance.
Fees are billed to clients as soon as values are available and settlement is due within agreed contractual terms.
As a result, the average level for debtors and accrued income outstanding, at any point in time, will represent approximately 4 months revenue.
The Group, in some situations, may be exposed to a concentration of credit risk, particularly from some of its larger clients or groups of connected clients.
This may arise during the period from recognition of management fees in the income statement and settlement of fees by clients.
very few clients have external credit ratings.
unit trust debtors The Group operates and manages a number of OEIC's and in doing so it seeks, as far as possible, to match the purchase and sale of investments in order to match the receipt or payment of funds from or to clients.
Where these positions are not matched the Group may be required to fund any shortfall although due to the short settlement period for these transactions the risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small.
In addition should any investor default on any payment due the Group would be entitled to recover any costs from the investor.
Cash and cash equivalents The Group adopts a low risk strategy in respect of its treasury management, at all times ensuring, as far as possible, that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed in line with the Groups risk management policy which is designed to manage the risks associated with the Groups cash and cash equivalent assets.
The treasury function for the Group is managed on a daily basis by the Group finance department who manage the Groups cash resources within guidelines set by the board who receive regular reports on both the treasury and regulatory positions for the Group.
The main parameters within which the treasury function operates include: Cash placed on deposit Deposits are only placed with counterparties Foreign currency risk is managed in order to minimize, where possible, the risk of movement in exchange rates.
This involves the repatriation of cash held by overseas subsidiaries to Sterling and this is achieved by way of dividends from subsidiaries as well as the settlement of intercompany transfer pricing arrangements.
Cash placed on deposit may be subject to changes in interest rates and the Group manages its deposits to maximise the returns but at the same time ensuring that the Groups working capital requirements can be met.
Management of capital The board's policy with respect to capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to provide a sufficient base to sustain the future development of the business while at the same time ensuring compliance with regulatory capital requirements.
The Company's ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange and the board monitors the composition of the shareholder base.
Details of substantial interests in the share capital of the Company are provided in the Director's Report on page 35.
Movements in share capital during the year which, include new shares issued to finance acquisitions as well are provided in note 24.
The board gives careful consideration to the appropriate funding structure for each acquisition which in the past have been structured to include both debt and equity funding.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups share-based payment schemes.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Group management board.
Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 111 Notes to the Accounts continued 37 Financial risk management continued Working capital The Group monitors the level of its working capital closely to ensure that it has sufficient cash available to meet its liabilities as they become due.
In addition, the Groups treasury function monitors cash balances on a daily basis.
Regulatory capital requirements In accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD the Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital as prescribed in the uK by the Financial Services Authority FSA.
The Group has been granted a waiver obtained from the FSA from the requirement to meet the minimum capital requirement under the consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
The waiver has been in place since 1 December 2007 and is currently effective until 31 December 2011.
At 30 September 2008 there were 28 regulated companies in the Group, 12 of which are registered in the united Kingdom and are regulated by the FSA.
With the exception of Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited which is a regulated insurance firm, all others are regulated investment firms.
Only the regulated investment firms are part of the Group consolidation for regulatory capital reporting purposes.
The Group has 16 overseas regulated companies all of which are subject to regulatory capital requirements which are determined by their local regulator.
The measurement of Capital Resources and Capital Resource Requirements CRR, which are referred to as the Pillar 1 capital requirements under CRD, are set out in regulatory rules.
The CRR for uK regulated investment firms is the higher of: the sum of the credit risk capital requirement and the market risk capital requirement: and the fixed overhead requirement The credit risk relates to the risk of a third party becoming unable to meet it's obligations to a firm.
The risk is calculated by using risk weighted percentages which are applied to the various exposure amounts.
Market risk represents the risk of a loss being incurred from fluctuations in exchange rates, calculated as a percentage of the total of the long or short positions, denominated in foreign currencies, whichever is the greater.
The fixed overhead requirement is calculated as a quarter of a firm's relevant fixed annual expenditure in the year's audited financial statements.
The regulated companies are required to submit financial returns to the FSA, or the local regulatory authority for overseas companies, setting out the calculation of the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
The Groups regulated companies are required to submit returns quarterly or semi-annually and the Group must submit a consolidated return semi-annually.
The Group is required, as part of the CRD, to conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, referred to as Pillar 2 capital requirements.
The objective of this process is to ensure that firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks not deemed to be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 minimum requirements.
This is a forward looking exercise which includes stress testing on major risks, considering how the firm would cope with a significant market downturn for example, and an assessment of the Groups ability to mitigate the risks.
All the regulated companies in the Group maintained surpluses of regulatory capital throughout the year.
112 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 38 Analysis of risks arising from financial instruments This note presents a numerical analysis of the Groups exposure to financial risk, as described in note 37.
The Groups direct and indirect exposure to financial risks arising from financial instruments and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Groups capital resources are described in note 37.
Disclosures relating to policyholder unit linked assets and liabilities in respect of the Groups life and pensions subsidiary have been excluded from this analysis as the risks and rewards from these assets and liabilities rest with the policyholders.
Credit risk i Maximum exposure to credit risk The maximum exposure of each class of financial assets is the carrying value of these assets which are shown below.

The sensitivity analysis covers the financial instruments at each of the balance sheet dates and assumes changes in market variables.
It should however be noted that due to the inherent uncertainty in world financial markets the assumptions made may differ significantly from the actual outcome particularly as market risks tend to be interdependent and are therefore unlikely to move in isolation.
The following assumptions have been made in respect of the market risks: Sterling exchange rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 10% Market interest rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 1% Fair values of investments are assumed to increase or decrease by 10% at each reporting date The impact of the assumptions on the risk variables, net of tax, are as follows: Group Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit or loss profit or loss equity equity As at 30 september 2008 000 000 000 000 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling uSD exchange rates 364 364 4,906 4,906 Sterling Euro 4,104 4,104 Fair value movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Investments Sterling equity prices 1,271 1,271 2,083 2,083 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 264 264 264 264 Impact on Impact on Impact on Impact on profit or loss profit or loss equity equity As at 30 September 2007 000 000 000 000 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling uSD exchange rates 318 318 2,453 2,453 Sterling Euro 171 171 Fair value movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Investments Sterling equity prices 627 627 1,082 1,082 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 105 105 105 105 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 121
