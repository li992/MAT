The comparative weighted average number of shares has been adjusted for the impact of reverse acquisition accounting as set out in note 1, Basis of Preparation.
Share awards granted in April 2007 were non-dilutive as at 27 April 2008 as the prospect of the performance conditions attached to these awards being satisfied is considered to be remote.
As a result share awards are not taken into account when determining the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period and therefore the basic and diluted earnings per share are the same.
