The Group has tested this goodwill for impairment by determining its value in use, considering the cash flows arising to the managing agency up to 2013.
The Groups long-term business forecast provides estimates of syndicate capacity from which the managing agency will earn fees.
The discount rate applied was 13.4% 2007 12.7%, which is based on a combination of factors including the Groups expected return on equity and costs of borrowing.
The Group deems the economic gains accruing from ownership of the managing agency as indefinite since, under the current business strategy, the Group will continue to benefit from these activities for as long as it carries on undertaking business.
The auction costs arose in purchasing additional capacity in the managed syndicates for the Groups corporate members.
The Group has deemed the income streams from this capacity as indefinite.
Auction costs have been tested for impairment at the end of 2008 and 2007, based on the value in use of the Groups interest in the syndicates, by considering the future cash flows of each syndicate up to the 2011 year of account, discounted at a rate of 13.4% 2007 12.7%.
The projections of syndicate cash flows represent managements best estimate of future underwriting profits, based on an analysis of current market conditions, the position of the insurance cycle, expected underwriting capacity and actuarial estimations of loss ratios.
These estimates are managements best knowledge of current actions and events, although actual outcomes may differ from these estimates.
There is significant headroom on both the goodwill and actions cost impairment tests.
