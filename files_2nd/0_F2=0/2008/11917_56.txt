Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations Background The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans throughout the world.
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
Defined contribution benefits are based on the amount of contributions paid in respect of an individual member, the investment returns earned and the amount of pension this money will buy when a member retires.
The largest plan is the Pearson Group Pension Plan UK Group plan with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
From 1 November 2006, all sections of the UK Group plan were closed to new members with the exception of a defined contribution section that was opened in 2003.
This section is available to all new employees of participating companies.
The other major defined benefit plans are based in the US.
Other defined contribution plans are operated principally overseas with the largest plan being in the US.
The specific features of these plans vary in accordance with the regulations of the country in which employees are located.
Pearson also has several post-retirement medical benefit plans PRMBs, principally in the US.
PRMBs are unfunded but are accounted for and valued similarly to defined benefit pension plans.
Assumptions The principal assumptions used for the UK Group plan and the US PRMB are shown below.
Weighted average assumptions have been shown for the other plans, which primarily relate to US pension plans.
2008 2007 UK Group Other UK Group Other % plan plans PRMB plan plans PRMB Inflation 2.80 2.80 2.80 3.30 2.93 3.00 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 6.40 6.25 6.25 5.80 6.01 6.05 Expected return on assets 6.33 7.60 6.50 7.27 Expected rate of increase in salaries 4.30 4.50 5.00 4.36 Expected rate of increase for pensions in 2.30 to 2.50 to payment and deferred pensions 4.20 4.30 Initial rate of increase in healthcare rate 9.00 9.50 Ultimate rate of increase in healthcare rate 5.00 5.00 The UK discount rate is based on the annualised yield on the iBoxx over 15-year AA-rated corporate bond index, adjusted to reflect the duration of our liabilities.
The US discount rate is set by reference to a US bond portfolio matching model.
The expected return on assets is based on market expectations of long-term asset returns for the defined portfolio at the end of the year.
The expected rates of return on categories of plan assets are determined by reference to relevant indices.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio.
The UK mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables PMFA 92 tables projected forward with medium cohort improvement factors.
The Group changed its mortality assumptions in the UK in 2007 to reflect an assumed increased life expectancy of pensioners by adding a 1% floor to the medium cohort projections.
For the US plans, the assumptions used were based on standard US mortality tables.
In 2007 GAM94 was used, and in 2008 this was updated to RP2000 to reflect the mortality assumption now more prevalent in the US.
Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations continued Using the above tables, the remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date for the UK and US Group plans is as follows: UK US 2008 2007 2008 2007 Male 21.5 21.3 17.6 17.9 Female 21.8 21.6 20.2 21.3 The remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, 20 years after the balance sheet date, for the UK and US Group plans is as follows: UK US 2008 2007 2008 2007 Male 23.3 23.1 17.6 17.9 Female 23.8 23.6 20.2 21.3 Financial statement information The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2008 Defined UK Group benefit Defined All figures in millions plan other Sub-total contribution PRMB Total Current service cost 33 3 36 41 1 78 Past service cost 1 1 5 6 Total operating expense 33 4 37 41 6 84 Expected return on plan assets 104 7 111 111 Interest on plan liabilities 93 7 100 3 103 Net finance income expense 11 11 3 8 Net income statement charge 22 4 26 41 9 76 Actual loss return on plan assets 130 27 157 157 2007 Defined benefit UK Group Defined All figures in millions plan other Sub-total contribution PRMB Total Current service cost 29 2 31 39 1 71 Total operating expense 29 2 31 39 1 71 Expected return on plan assets 96 7 103 103 Interest on plan liabilities 84 7 91 2 93 Net finance income expense 12 12 2 10 Net income statement charge 17 2 19 39 3 61 Actual loss return on plan assets 128 4 132 132 The total operating charge is included in administrative and other expenses.

Defined contribution assets will no longer be disclosed as part of the UK Group plan assets.
The other movements in both the change in value of plan assets and liabilities over the year represent the separation out of these defined contribution assets.

The trustees of the plan are required to act in the best interest of the plans beneficiaries.
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes was completed as at 1 January 2006 and revealed a funding shortfall.
The Group has agreed that the funding shortfall will be eliminated by 31 December 2014.
In 2008 the Group contributed 21m 2007: 121m including a special contribution of 100m and has agreed to contribute 21.9m per annum thereafter in excess of an estimated 30m of regular contributions.
The Group expects to contribute $92m in 2009 and $86m in 2010 to its US pension plans.
Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations continued Sensitivities The net retirement benefit obligations are calculated using a number of assumptions, the most significant being the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation.
The effect of a one percentage point increase and decrease in the discount rate on the defined benefit obligation and the total pension expense is as follows: 2008 All figures in millions 1% increase 1% decrease Effect on: Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 180.1 209.6 Decrease increase of aggregate of service cost and interest cost UK Group plan 2.2 1.1 Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation US plan 12.2 14.5 The effect of a one percentage point increase and decrease in the assumed medical cost trend rates is as follows: 2008 All figures in millions 1% increase 1% decrease Effect on: Increase decrease in post-retirement medical benefit obligation 3.3 2.9 Increase decrease of aggregate of service cost and interest cost 0.2 0.1
