The own shares represent the shares held by employee trust schemes, of which the sole purpose is to hold shares of the Company for settlement of share awards.
The number of shares held by the trust schemes at the end of 2008 was 38,913,554 2007 15,224,037.
Bonus reserve contains the element of the bonus that is payable in shares or share options to senior members of staff in accordance with the terms of the deferred share benefit plan.
The reserve mainly increases with the charge for the year for those elements, and decreases when the shares or share options vest.
The reserve also contains an element of shares granted to employees in accordance with the terms of the Share Incentive Plan SIP.
The SIP represents an incentive of two free shares granted to employees who decided to buy one share.
The movement in the year for SIP costs represents the cost of granting free shares to employees that purchase shares, less the cost of shares that vested and employees sold.
The cost of share options exercise represents the sum of the market value of the granted shares when employees exercise share options, less both the exercise price and the fair value of the option previously expensed in accordance with FRS 20 Share-based payment.
The adjustment to bonus costs represents elements of previous years bonus initially expected to be settled in cash that became liabilities to be settled in shares, and vice versa.
The adjustment has no impact on the results for the year and does not significantly affect the key performance ratios.
Warrant reserves represent the proportion of proceeds, from the issue of ordinary shares with warrants attached, attributable to the warrants.
The Company transfers the amount previously recognised in the warrant reserve to share premium on the exercise of the warrants.
Retained earnings represent the accumulation of profits and losses up to the balance sheet date, after the distribution of dividends and other adjustments.
The Company can distribute retained earnings of up to 36.7m 2007 52.1m.
