Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually.
There has been no impairment of goodwill in 2007 or 2008.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial plans approved by management covering a five-year period in developed markets and longer in under developed markets reflecting the need to develop brand awareness and to increase market penetration.
Cash flows beyond the periods of the approved plans are extrapolated using the long-term growth rates stated below.
The carrying value of goodwill and the key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations were as follows: Chile Peru Argentina Spain USA UK Detail by CGU Carrying value of goodwill m 188.8 42.0 69.8 1,237.6 1,353.8 1,006.2 a Terminal growth rate 6.9% 6.7% 9.5% 2.8% 3.2% 3.2% Discount rate 10.0% 12.0% 14.0% 8.0% 7.0% 8.0% a Following normal practice, the terminal growth rates in the relatively under developed markets in Latin America are nominal and the terminal growth rates in Europe and the US are real.
The value-in-use calculations are sensitive to changes in the long-term growth rates and discount rates.
The long-term growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts of long-term national growth rates included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are based on estimated weighted average costs of capital in each country, are after tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.
The calculated recoverable value of the operations in Chile, Peru, Argentina and Spain would have to decrease 41%, 31%, 60% and 26%, respectively, before the associated goodwill would be impaired.
This could occur if the terminal growth rates and annual growth rates in the plans all fell by more than 2.0 percentage points, 2.2 percentage points, 6.2 percentage points and 2.1 percentage points, respectively.
Rates of growth in the US and UK would have to be negative before the associated goodwill would be impaired.
The sensitivity of discount rates is not provided above because any changes in the estimated weighted average costs of capital of the magnitude needed to cause impairment would be offset by other factors.
