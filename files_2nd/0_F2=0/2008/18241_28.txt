Financial Instruments In common with all businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and methods used to measure them are as follows: Principal financial instruments The principal instruments used by the Group, from which risks arise, are: 2008 2007 000 000 Other receivables 12,410 18,660 Trade receivables 17,291 15,204 Bank overdraft 358 30 Cash at bank 31,295 31,926 Secured bank loans 31,250 32,250 Fixed rate installment mortgages 84,245 82,878 Trade and other payables 29,325 31,590 Interest rate derivatives 55,431 57,274 Current Asset Investments 213 226 Other Investments 124 617 General objectives, policies and processes The Directors have overall responsibility for determining the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, while retaining ultimate responsibility for them, have delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies, to the finance function.
The Board reviews information on a regular basis on each of the properties, through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.
The overall objectives of the Directors are to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Financial Assets 2008 2007 000 000 Cash Sterling denominated 18,071 20,656 Cash USA dollar denominated 13,224 11,270 31,295 31,926 Page 39 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued All cash balances receive interest at a variable rate with reference to LIBOR for sterling denominated balances and USA Prime rate for USA dollar denominated balances.
All cash balances are repayable on demand.
The Group has trade and other receivables of 13,581,000 2007 13,400,000 and trade and other payables of 13,668,000 2007 7,012,000 denominated in USA dollars.
Current asset investments are denominated in Sterling.
Current and non-current asset investments, trade and other receivables and payables are included in these accounts at amortised cost which is considered to equate to their fair value.
Financial Liabilities Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due and arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principle repayments of its debt instruments.
The Group has a low level of gearing relative to the property investment sector as a whole.
At 31 March 2008 gearing was 8.7% and the level of debt due for repayment within one year was 1.5 million.
Cash balances at the year end were 30 million excluding tenants deposits.
The Groups policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities as they fall due and to achieve this aim it seeks to maintain cash balances to meet all requirements.
The Group seeks to reduce liquidity risk by fixing interest rates on a proportion of its long term borrowings while retaining some loans at floating rates in order to take advantage of interest rate fluctuations.
Liquidity risk profile The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is set out below: 2008 2007 000 000 Within one year or less or on demand 1,475 3,218 Between one and two years 4,676 1,906 Between two and five years 20,215 11,071 After five years 89,487 98,963 115,853 115,158 The Group has undrawn borrowing facilities of nil 2007 85 million expiring within one year and 65 million 2007 67 million expiring after five years.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing and foreign currency instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange, or other market factors.
Page 40 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 Interest rate risk profile The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 March, after taking account of interest rate instruments taken out by the Group was: 2008 2007 000 000 Floating rate liabilities Sterling denominated 20,358 20,030 Fixed rate liabilities Sterling denominated 19,692 20,900 Fixed rate liabilities USA dollar denominated 75,803 74,228 115,853 115,158 The floating rate financial liabilities comprise Sterling denominated bank borrowings bearing rates based on LIBOR and USA dollar denominated bank borrowings bearing rates based on USA Prime rate.
The Group seeks to minimise the risk or sudden and unexpected rises in finance costs by way of financial derivative instruments while retaining the ability to take advantage of falling interest rates.
Foreign exchange risk The Group holds property and all related borrowings in US Dollars.
Consequently the Group has a degree of exposure to foreign currency risk.
As the Groups investments in the US are held for the long term and funds are not usually returned to the UK the Groups policy is not to hedge foreign currency transactions.
Instead management monitor exchange rates on a regular basis and elect to transfer funds between the UK and the US only when the rate is favourable to do so.
There exists an interest rate risk to the Income Statement by the recognition of the fair values of the interest rate hedging instruments.
At the year end the total value of the hedging instruments is a net 96.9m.
The potential effect on the income statement of a 0.5% movement in interest rates is a movement of 3.9m to the total value of the hedging instruments.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk which arises principally from its trade receivables and other debtors.
It is the risk that another party fails to discharge its obligation in respect of these instruments.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables derive from the Groups rental income which in the main is demanded quarterly in advance.
Demands for rent are sent prior to the due date.
Payment of rent is made either through BACS or by cheque with some small amounts of rent occasionally received in cash.
Management monitors credit risk on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed and security deposits taken from new residential and commercial tenants.
It has long been the Groups policy to make full provision against any rental arrears where recovery is in doubt.
A provision will usually be made where a tenant is in arrears for more than a year or where solicitors have been instructed to recover the debt.
At 31 March 2008 there were approximately 5.6 million of arrears which were more than a year old for which provisions have been made.
During the year the provision for irrecoverable debts decreased by 0.1 million.
Due to the large number of tenants across various sectors and geographical areas the Directors do not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including financial instruments in the Balance Sheet.

The weighted average interest rate is 6.8%.
Details of Financial Risk Management are set out in the Directors Report.
Fair value of financial liabilities The fair values have been determined by discounting the net present value of the difference between the contractual cost of derivative financial instruments and their forecast market rates.
The table below sets out by category the book values and fair value of the Groups financial liabilities.
In both 2007 and 2008 there was no difference between the book value and fair value of all the other financial assets and liabilities of the Group.
2007 Notional Fair Value Book Value Principal adjustment Fair Value 000 000 000 000 Financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Liabilities: Floating rate debt 7,280 7,280 Fixed rate debt 107,878 6,139 114,017 Fair value adjustment 6,139 2008 Notional Fair Value Book Value Principal adjustment Fair Value 000 000 000 000 Financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Liabilities: Floating rate debt 5,608 5,608 Fixed rate debt 110,245 12,630 122,875 Fair value adjustment 12,630 Capital Any financial instrument issued by the Group which meets the definition of equity is treated as such in the financial statements.
The Group does not have any externally imposed capital requirements other than covenant requirements in certain of its loans.
Given the Groups low gearing the requirements are comfortably met.
