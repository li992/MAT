The effective taxation rate for continuing operations for each period has been assumed to be the same as that for the Group.
Continuing return on invested capital is calculated using continuing profit from operations divided by continuing average invested capital.
Continuing average invested capital has been calculated using a 13 month average used for Performance share plan.
Periods reporting under IFRS have been restated for the change in presentation of the pension finance charge credit from within profit from operations to net finance costs.
The period ended 2004 has been restated to comply with Urgent Issue Task Force UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts.
The amounts disclosed for 2004 are stated on the basis of UK GAAP because it is not practicable to restate amounts for periods prior to the date of transition to IFRS.
The principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRS are explained in the published financial statements for Northern Foods plc for the 52 weeks ended 1 April 2006.
