As security for this loan, the Bakgatla has pledged its 55% interest in the company that holds the right to be granted a prospecting right on portion two of Rooderand 46JQ Rooderand to Anglo Platinum.
If the prospecting right is not granted to Anglo Platinum in terms of section 17 of the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002 within a period of three years from 30 November 2006, Anglo Platinum has the election to acquire the Bakgatlas interest in the company holding the Rooderand right at par value in lieu of the capital and any interest accrued on the loan at that date.
As at year-end, management has applied for the new prospecting right, which application was refused on the basis of not facilitating empowerment.
Anglo Platinum took this decision on judicial review.
Anglo Platinum has decided not to advance the legal proceedings pending negotiations with the Department of Minerals and Energy DME and, given the significant stake in this property that is held by an empowerment partner, Anglo Platinum is confident that either through the court process, or through engaging the DME, the prospecting right will be awarded.
P lateau Resources Proprietary Limited has pledged its 50% shareholding in Micawber 277 Proprietary Limited, which holds the rights to the Ga-Phasha project.
Plateau Resources Proprietary Limited has also ceded its participation interest in the Ga-Phasha unincorporated joint venture as security for this loan.

No provision for doubtful debts has been raised on any amounts past due at balance sheet date as these amounts have either been received post year-end or the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold collateral over these balances.
Before accepting any new customers, the Group uses a credit bureau or performs a credit assessment to assess the potential customers credit quality and credit limits.
The credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis throughout the year due to the volatility in the commodity price movements which necessitates the frequent review of credit limits.
Trade accounts receivable involve a small group of international companies.
The financial condition of these companies and the countries in which they operate are regularly reviewed.
Therefore the Group has no provision for doubtful debts.
The fair value of trade accounts receivable is not materially different from the carrying values presented.
There are no trade accounts receivable pledged as security to secure any borrowings of the Group.

Assets held for sale continued Disposal of 51% of Lebowa Platinum Mines LPM and 1% of Ga-Phasha, Boikgantsho and Kwanda Joint Venture Projects In September 2007, the Board approved the disposal of an effective 51% of LPM Richtrau 177 Proprietary Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo Platinum and an additional 1% of its interest in the Ga-Phasha, Boikgantsho and Kwanda joint-venture 50:50 projects, to Anooraq Resources Corporation for a cash purchase consideration of R3.6 billion.
In April 2008, a suite of definitive legal agreements was entered into, which remained subject to various suspensive conditions.
Due to the significant deterioration in global market conditions, coupled with a material decline in platinum group metal prices and constrained debt and equity capital markets, in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Lebowa mine plan and project pipeline, including the Middelpunt Hill UG2 expansion project, were placed under critical review in conjunction with Anooraq.
Anglo Platinum and Anooraq remain committed to concluding the transaction as soon as practically possible and have thus extended the date for fulfilment of the conditions until 30 April 2009.
Disposal of investment in associate Northam and 50% interest in Booysendal Joint Venture In September 2007, the Board approved the disposal of Anglo Platinums 22.4% interest in Northam and 50% stake in the Booysendal Joint Venture and a portion of Der Brochen to Mvelaphanda Resources Limited Mvela for a purchase consideration of R4 billion.
The sale was subject to the finalisation of binding legal agreements and certain regulatory and third-party approvals at 31 December 2007.
Subsequent to this, the transaction agreements were concluded and all the conditions precedent, except for ministerial approval pertaining to the transfer of control of new-order Booysendal prospecting rights, were met.
The parties subsequently restructured the agreements in August 2008 to implement the Northam part of the transaction, as this portion of the transaction did not require minsterial approval.
That part of the transaction then closed on 20 August 2008 with the funds flowing from Mvela to Anglo Platinum and Anglo Platinum transferring ownership of the Northam shares to Mvela.
The funds received relating to the Northam transaction R1,6 billion were utilised by Anglo Platinum whereas the remainder of the funds were transferred into escrow R542 million and invested in rights to preference shares R1,610 million.
The funds relating to Booysendal will only be released to Anglo Platinum upon ministerial approval.
Consequently, the Booysendal part of the transaction has not yet been implemented.
Although the Northam portion of the transaction has been implemented, it is still subject to unwind if minsterial approval does not occur.
Impact of closing of the BEE transaction with Mvela Due to the phased implementation of the Mvela transaction, the following has occurred: Anglo Platinum has derecognised its 22.4% shareholding in Northam and recognised a profit on the difference between the carrying amount of the investment of R411 million and proceeds received of R1,572 million.
The funds received from Mvela in respect of the Booysendal portion of the transaction have been recognised as assets with a corresponding obligation to repay the funds failing the receipt of ministerial approval.
In addition, the related assets have not yet been derecognised.

Defined benefit plan Post-retirement medical aid benefits The post-retirement medical aid obligation is actuarially valued annually.
The obligation was last valued as at 31 December 2008 using the projected unit credit method.
The assumptions used in the valuation included estimates of life expectancy and long-term estimates of the increase in medical costs, appropriate discount rates and the level of claims based on the Groups experiences.
The plan assets comprise a captive cell arrangement with Guardrisk, which arrangement exists to fund the Groups obligations towards pensioners.
The funds are invested in the money market and the medical aid premiums are paid by Guardrisk to the medical aid funds on behalf of the Group.
The Group does not expect to make a contribution 2008: R12,959,100 to the captive cell for the 2009 year.
The actual return on plan assets for the year amounted to R24,534,907 2007: R5,639,904.

Contingent liabilities Letters of comfort have been issued to financial institutions to cover certain banking facilities.
There are no encumbrances of Group assets, other than the houses held under finance leases by the Group as disclosed in note 29.
Aquarius Platinum South Africa Proprietary Limited holds a put option to put their interest in the Kroondal pooling-and-sharing arrangement note 17 to the Group in the case of termination of that relationship.
The probability of the option being exercised is considered remote.
The amount of such an obligation is dependent on a discounted cash flow valuation of their interest at that point in time.
The Group is the subject of various claims, which are individually immaterial.
The expected outcomes of these individual claims are varied, but on a probability weighting the amount is estimated at R82 million 2007: R70 million.
The Group has in the case of some of its mines provided the Department of Minerals and Energy with guarantees that cover the difference between closure cost and amounts held in the environmental trusts.
At 31 December 2008, these guarantees amounted to R2,030 million 2007: R1,939 million note 31.
The Group has provided Lexshell 36 General Trading Proprietary Limited a company owned by the Bakgatla-Ba-Kgafela traditional community with a facility that covers their debt repayments should that company not be able to meet the repayments.
The facility is limited to Union Sections cash flows, and a call on this facility is considered a remote possibility.
Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited RPM has granted a R2 billion loan facility to Royal Bafokeng Resources Proprietary Limited RBR for the purpose of funding its contributions to the BRPM joint venture.
The loan is repayable in full on 11 August 2012.
The RBR has ceded and pledged its interest in the BRPM joint venture to RPM as security for the loan.
RPM also has the right to register a notarial bond and a mortgage bond over RBRs undivided share of the assets of the BRPM joint venture.
Changes in accounting estimate Metal inventories During the year, the Group changed its estimate of the quantities of inventory based on the outcome of a physical count of in-process metals.
The Group runs a theoretical metal inventory system based on inputs, the results of previous physical counts and outputs.
Due to the nature of in-process inventories being contained in weirs, pipes and other vessels, physical counts only take place once per annum, except in the PMR which takes place once every two years.
This change in estimate has had the effect of increasing the value of inventory disclosed in the financial statements by R200 million 2007: R148 million.
This results in the recognition of an after-tax gain of R144 million 2007: R105 million.
The amount of the effect in future periods has not been disclosed because estimation is impracticable.

Financial instruments Capital risk management The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes interest-bearing borrowings disclosed under note 28 and obligations due under finance leases disclosed under note 29, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, which comprises issued share capital and premium and accumulated profits disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Groups capital management objective is to achieve an optimal weighted average cost of capital while continuing to safeguard the Groups ability to meet its liquidity requirements including its commitments in respect of capital expenditure, repay borrowings as they fall due and continue as a going concern.
The policy of the Group is to achieve sufficient gearing so as to have an optimal weighted average cost of capital while also ensuring that at all times its creditworthiness is considered to be at least investment grade.
The targeted level of gearing is determined after consideration of the following key factors: Current and forecast metal prices and exchange rates and their impact upon revenue and gearing under various scenarios.
The needs of the Group to fund current and future capital expenditure to achieve its 5% production growth target.
The desire of the Group to maintain its gearing within levels considered to be acceptable and consistent with an investment grade credit standing, taking into account potential business volatility and position of the Group in the business cycle.
On an annual basis the Group updates its life of mine models and long-term business plan.
These outputs are then incorporated into the budget process.
The targeted production profile determines the Groups funding requirements under its base case economic assumptions.
This then determines whether the Group is likely to have excess capital in terms of its policy or whether it is likely to require additional capital.
If it has excess capital the Group will consider returning this to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks : whichever may be appropriate at the time.
Alternatively, if additional capital is required, the Group will look to source this from either the debt markets or from shareholders, whichever is most appropriate at the time, so as to meet its policy objectives and based on market circumstances.
These decisions are evaluated by the Groups corporate finance and treasury departments, before being approved by its Executive Committee and Board, where required.
The Group has entered into a number of debt facilities that dictate certain requirements in respect of capital management.
These covenants are a key consideration when the capital management strategies of the Group are evaluated.
These covenants include: maximum net debt tangible net worth ratios: and minimum tangible net worth values.
The Group has complied with these requirements.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2007.
Significant accounting policies Details of significant accounting policies, including the recognition criteria, the basis for measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each category of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument, are disclosed under the notes in accounting policies.

Financial instruments continued Financial risk management The Group does not trade in financial instruments but, in the normal course of its operations, the Group is primarily exposed to currency, metal price, credit, interest rate and liquidity risks.
In order to manage these risks, the Group may enter into transactions that make use of financial instruments.
The Group has developed a comprehensive risk management process to facilitate, control and monitor these risks.
This process includes formal documentation of policies, including limits, controls and reporting structures.
Controlling risk in the Group The Executive Committee and the Financial Risk Subcommittee are responsible for risk management activities within the Group.
Overall limits have been set by the Board.
The Executive Committee is responsible for setting individual limits.
In order to ensure adherence to these limits, activities are marked to market on a daily basis and reported to the Group treasury.
The Finance Risk Subcommittee, composed of Marketing and Treasury executives, meets monthly to review market trends and develop strategies to be submitted for Executive Committee approval.
The Treasury is responsible for monitoring currency, interest rate and liquidity risk within the limits and constraints set by the Board.
The Marketing Department is responsible for monitoring metal price risk, also within the laid-down limits and constraints set by the Board.

Accordingly the Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuating exchange rates and manages this exposure when appropriate through the use of financial instruments.
These instruments typically comprise forward exchange contracts and options.
Forward contracts are the primary instruments used to manage currency risk.
Forward contracts require a future purchase or sale of foreign currency at a specified price.
Current policy prevents the use of option contracts without Executive Committee approval.
Options provide the Group with the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell foreign currency at a predetermined price, on or before a future date.
No foreign currency options were entered into during the year.

The ability to place forward contracts is restricted owing to the limited size of the financial market in PGMs.
Financial markets in certain base metals are, however, well established.
At the recommendation of the Risk Committee, the Group may place contracts where opportunities present themselves to increase reduce the exposure to metal price fluctuations.
At times, historically, the Group has made use of forward contracts to manage this exposure.
Forward contracts enable the Group to obtain a predetermined price for delivery at a future date.
No such contracts existed at year-end.

Financial instruments continued Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk During the year, the Group was in a borrowed position, while still maintaining some surplus cash on deposit.
The size of the Groups position, be it either short cash or long cash, exposes it to interest rate risk.
This risk is managed through the term structure utilised when placing deposits or taking out borrowings.
Furthermore, when appropriate, the Group may also cover these exposures by means of derivative financial instruments subject to the approval of the Executive Committee.
During the period, the Group did not use any forward rate agreements to manage this risk.
The carrying amount of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at balance sheet date that are subject to interest rate risk is as follows: Subject to interest Non-interest rate movement bearing Total Fixed Floating Rm Rm Rm Rm 2008 Financial assets Investment held by environmental trusts 66 66 Other financial assets 158 158 Trade and other receivables 3,941 3,941 Other current financial assets 1,610 5 1,615 Cash and cash equivalents 2,870 2,870 4,704 3,946 8,650 Financial liabilities Interest-bearing borrowings 10,313 10,313 Obligations due under finance leases 509 509 Other financial liabilities 152 152 Current interest-bearing borrowings 5,507 5,507 Trade and other payables 4,956 4,956 Other current financial liabilities 2,388 2,388 16,329 7,496 23,825 2007 Financial assets Investment held by environmental trusts 120 120 Other financial assets 116 116 Trade and other receivables 4,246 4,246 Other current financial assets 3 3 Cash and cash equivalents 4,079 4,079 4,315 4,249 8,564 Financial liabilities Interest-bearing borrowings 2,713 2,713 Obligations due under finance leases 490 490 Current interest-bearing borrowings 4,962 4,962 Trade and other payables 4,105 4,105 8,165 4,105 12,270 Interest rate sensitivity The Group is sensitive to the movements in the ZAR and US dollar interest rates which are the primary interest rates to which the Group is exposed.

Financial instruments continued Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet a financial commitment in any location or currency.
This risk is minimised through the holding of cash balances and sufficient available borrowing facilities refer to note 28.
In addition, detailed cash flow forecasts are regularly prepared and reviewed by Treasury.
The cash needs of the Group are managed according to its requirements.
The following table details the Groups contractual maturity for its financial liabilities.
The table has been compiled based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to repay the liability.
The cash flows include both the principal and interest payments.
The adjustment column includes the possible future cash flows attributable to the financial instrument which are not included in the carrying value of the financial liability at balance sheet date.

Credit risk arises from the risk that a counterparty may default or not meet its obligations timeously.
The Group minimises credit risk by ensuring that counterparties are banking institutions of the highest quality, that appropriate credit limits are in place for each counterparty and that short-term cash investments are spread amongst a number of different counterparties.
Banking counterparty limits are reviewed annually by the Board.
Therefore a significant portion of the Groups revenue and trade accounts receivable are from these major customers.
The financial condition of these companies and the countries they operate in are reviewed annually by the Financial Risk Subcommittee.

Revision of conversion price applicable to convertible preference shares As the dividend cover in respect of the 2007 dividend was less than 1.4 times, it was necessary, in accordance with the rights and privileges attaching to the convertible perpetual cumulative preference shares convertible preference shares, to amend the conversion price to be used when the convertible preference shares are converted into ordinary shares.
The conversion price was R284.24 or 35.18154 ordinary shares for each 100 convertible preference shares converted.
Based on the volume-weighted average traded price of Anglo Platinum ordinary shares on the JSE Limited for the five business days ended Friday, 7 March 2008 of R1,299.15, the conversion price was amended to R281.05 or 35.58086 shares for every 100 convertible preference shares converted.
This decrease in the conversion price has resulted in a deemed dividend for the purpose of calculating earnings per share in terms of IAS 33 Earnings per share to the outstanding preference shareholders at the date of the adjustment.
Consequently, this deemed dividend of R3.19 2007: R4.19 per convertible preference share, amounting to R5 million 2007: R16 million has been taken into account when calculating the basic earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders.
This amount has been included with the preference dividends due to preference shareholders of R7 million 2007: R15 million in the total amount attributable to preference shareholders.
Comparative figures The 2007 interest-bearing borrowings have been reclassified between current and non-current.
As as result, the long-term portion of R2,713 million has been reclassified to non-current liabilities.
In addition, an amount of R210 million has been reclassified from liabilties directly related to assets held for sale to current interest-bearing borrowings.
As a result of both reclassifications, current interest-bearing borrowings are now reflected at R4,962 million.
Refer note 28 R597 million of accruals has been reallocated from other liabilities to trade and other payables.
As a result of these changes, the prior year IFRS 7 disclosure in note 43 has been amended accordingly.
Contingent assets Amandelbult insurance claims Due to a flash flood on 21 January 2008, the water inflow from the storm, together with the water inflows from several days of abnormal rainfall, exceeded the installed dewatering capacity of the Amandelbult number 1 vertical shaft and resulted in the flooding of the shaft bottom including the pump station.
This was recorded as a 1:200 year event.
Production after the flood event was reduced to around 25% of normal output.
An emergency dewatering programme was implemented to return the shaft to normal production levels as soon as possible.
The insurers were immediately advised and Anglo Platinum has submitted a material damage claim together with the business interruption claim for the period during which the mine was not at full capacity.
However, the quantum claimable in respect of the business interruption claim under this policy can only be determined once the indemnity period of 24 months has lapsed.
The final quantum of the claim is dependent on a number of variables which can only be determined during or at the end of the 24-month indemnity period.
Consequently, no compensation for lost revenue in respect of the business interruption claim has been recorded due to the uncertainty around the quantum of the claim.
Polokwane insurance claims On 13 February 2008, a slag and matte run-out occurred at the Polokwane Smelter, resulting in damage to both the furnace itself and ancillary equipment.
After a successful repair, the furnace resumed operation and processed the majority of concentrate stocks that had accumulated during the repair period.
Insurers were notified of the incident, and a material damage and business interruption claim is in preparation and at discussion with insurers.
On 5 November 2008, a subsequent run-out with a distinct failure mechanism resulted in a second shut-down of the smelter.
Repairs have been successfully concluded, and the smelter has resumed operation.
Insurers have been notified of the incident, and a material damage and business interruption claim is in preparation.
The business interruption quantum of both events is to be assessed across a 24-month period, and is dependent on a number of variables which can only be determined as the 24-month period progresses.
Post-balance event Acquisition of Zimbabwean group of companies In December 2008, Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited entered into a conditional agreement with Anglo American South Africa Limited to acquire a Zimbabwean group of companies, which include the Unki mine and 89% of the PGM mineral rights held by Anglo American in Zimbabwe, for US$22.5 million.
The agreement became unconditional on 27 January 2009.
The Zimbabwean group of companies will be consolidated with effect from 2009.

The Group Employee Share Participation Scheme equity-settled Anglo Platinum decided to implement the Employee Share Participation Scheme, the Anglo Platinum Kotula ESOP the Scheme to incentivise its employees, and recognised that the Scheme will contribute to the alignment of shareholders and employees interests in respect of the value growth of the Company.
Anglo Platinum is fully supportive of BEE as a strategic transformation objective and recognised the importance of the participation of its employees in its transformation initiatives.
Anglo Platinum reached consensus with its recognised unions on the key terms and structure of the Scheme and the Scheme was approved at a combined general meeting of shareholders on 31 March 2008.
The Scheme has empowered those Anglo Platinum employees who were not participating in any other Anglo Platinum Scheme to acquire approximately 1% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company, subject to the provisions of the Trust.
To faciliate the Scheme, Anglo Platinum established the Kotula Trust for an eight-year duration.
The number of shares subscribed for by the Trust was in the proportion of 60% A ordinary shares loan shares to 40% Scheme ordinary shares fully faciliated shares.
The Company allotted 1,008,519 ordinary shares and 1,512,780 A ordinary shares to the Kotula Trust on 16 May 2008.
The A ordinary shares were created specifically to facilitate the implementation of the Scheme.
The key terms of the A ordinary shares are as follows: Anglo Platinum will have the right to repurchase and cancel all or some of the A ordinary shares in accordance with the cancellation formula.
The A ordinary shares will not be listed but will be considered in determining a quorum and entitled to vote on any or all resolutions proposed at general annual general meetings.
The A ordinary shares which are not repurchased and cancelled will be converted into ordinary shares.
The A ordinary shares will be entitled to receive an A ordinary share dividend equal to one sixth of the dividend per ordinary share declared by the Company from time to time and will rank pari passu with the ordinary dividends.
The beneficiaries of the Scheme are all permanent employees of any member of the Group other than employees who are members of any other share option or share incentive plan implemented by any member of the Group.
The Trust will allocate 10 million Kotula shares to participants annually based on an employees employment status on 31 March every year.
On each vesting date, the beneficiaries will become entitled to receive their distribution shares and will correspondingly realise that portion of their Kotula shares that corresponds to the distribution shares distributed by the Trust.
Vesting will occur on the fifth, sixth and seventh anniversaries of the subscription date.
The Trust will pay dividends after making provision for Trust expenses and liabilities to the beneficiaries in proportion to the number of Kotula shares accumulated, in November each year.
