The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 74 Business review Governance Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies The Morgan Crucible Company plc the Company is a company incorporated in the UK.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group, and include the Groups interest in associates.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice: these are presented on pages 115 to 123.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
In the application of these accounting policies, judgments made by the Directors that have a significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year, are discussed in note 28. a Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments available-for-sale.
b Functional and presentation currency The Group financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant inuence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
significant inuence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identied on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the income, expenses and equity movements of the associate, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant inuence commences until the date that significant inuence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the associate.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with the associate are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the associate.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
d Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 75 Business review Governance Financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations, are translated to pounds sterling at an average rate for the period where this approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation since the adoption of IFRSs are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
iii Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations and of related hedges, are taken to the translation reserve.
They are released to the income statement upon disposal.
e Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, nancing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see accounting policy f. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
f Hedging i Cash ow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash ows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
If a hedge of a forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in the hedging reserve are reclassied into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash ow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding policy statement, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in the hedging reserve and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in the hedging reserve is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used to hedge economically the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
iii Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in the translation reserve.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit orloss.
g Property, plant and e uipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, or at deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy l. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 5 January 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRSs, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the asset.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property are recognised in Other one-off items in profit or loss.
Gains and losses on the disposal of plant and equipment are recognised in Operating costs in profit or loss.
The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 76 Business review Governance Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued ii Leased assets Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classied as finance leases.
Leased assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
iii Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 50 years Plant and equipment presses, kilns and furnaces 10-20 years Other plant and equipment 10 years Fixtures and ttings 10 years Motor vehicles and computer equipment 3 years h Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 5 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP.
The classication and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 5 January 2004 has not been reconsidered.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment see accounting policy l. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a minority interest in a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of the additional investment over the carrying amount of the interest in the net assets acquired at the date of exchange.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a minority interest in a subsidiary is recognised in Other reserves.
ii Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development, use and sale of products or processes.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy l. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy l. iv Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Capitalised development costs 3 years Computer software 3-6 years Operating intangible assets 8-20 years i Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their fair value less impairment losses see accounting policy l. The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 77 Business review Governance Financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in-first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
k Cash and cash e uivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash ows.
l Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than inventories see accounting policy j and deferred tax assets see accounting policy s, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated see i below.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units group of units and then, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro-rata basis.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss even though the financial asset has not been derecognised.
The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the Groups investments in receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash ows, discounted at the original effective interest rate i. e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of these financial assets.
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairment An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in its recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classied as available-for-sale is not reversed through profit or loss.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classied as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount and when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Accounting policies continued m Share capital i Ordinary share capital Ordinary shares are classied as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of Ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity.
ii Preference share capital Preference share capital is classied as equity if it is non-redeemable and any dividends are discretionary, or is redeemable but only at the Companys option.
Dividends on Preference share capital classied as equity are recognised as distributions within equity.
iii Repurchase of share capital and own shares held by ESOP trust treasury shares When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, is net of any tax effects and is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares and the purchase of own shares by the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are presented as a deduction from total equity.
Own shares held by the ESOP trust are classied as treasury shares.
Repurchased shares are classied as treasury shares until their subsequent cancellation.
n Employee benets i Dened contribution plans Obligations for contributions to dened contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Dened benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of dened benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualied actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benets available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
The Group recognises all contractual gains and losses arising from dened benefit plans directly in equity immediately.
iii Long-term service benets The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benets, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method, or similar approximation, and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
iv Share-based payment transactions The Group operates various share option programmes that allow Group employees to acquire shares in the Company.
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and The Morgan Crucible Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan, awards of shares are made to various key executives and under the Directors Share Option Plan 2006 2006 ESOP, the Executive Share Option Scheme 2004 2004 ESOS and the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 1995 ESOS share options are granted by the Company.
The Company also maintains an all-employee sharesave scheme available to employees in the UK and Germany.
The fair value of awards made and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reect the actual number of share options for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are met.
The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 79 Business review Governance Financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued The fair value of the options and awards under each scheme have been measured using the following models: Directors Share Option Plan 2006 Monte Carlo model Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 Monte Carlo model The Morgan Crucible Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan Dividend Discount method Executive Share Option Scheme 2004 Monte Carlo model Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 Binomial Lattice option pricing model Employee Sharesave Scheme 1995 Black-Scholes Merton model Employee Sharesave Scheme 2004 Black-Scholes Merton model Employee Sharesave Scheme 2004 Germany Black-Scholes Merton model The choice of model takes into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made and the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reect the actual number of share options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
o Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specic to the liability.
i Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
ii Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benets to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
iii Environmental In accordance with the Groups environmental policy a provision is recognised for known environmental issues which the Group will rectify over the next few years.
In a number of jurisdictions companies have a constructive obligation to remedy any known environmental problems.
p Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at their fair value.
Revenue i Goods sold Revenue from the sale of products is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
ii Government grants Government grants are recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance that it will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to it.
Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised as revenue in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are incurred.
Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in the income statement as other operating income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.

Accounting policies continued r Expenses i Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
ii Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction in the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
iii Net nancing costs Net nancing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement see accounting policy f, expected return on IAS 19 pension assets and interest on IAS 19 obligations.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
s Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which theasset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will berealised.
t Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing products in a particular line of business business segment or in providing products within a particular economic environment geographic segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
The Groups primary business segments are its Divisions.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise mainly investments and related revenue, loans and borrowings and related expenses, corporate assets primarily the Groups headquarters and head ofce expenses, and income tax assets and liabilities.
u Classication of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity i. e. forming part of shareholders funds only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: i they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and ii where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a xed amount of cash or other financial assets for a xed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this denition is not met, the proceeds of the issue are classied as a financial liability.
Where an instrument so classied takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classied in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 81 Business review Governance Financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued v Investments in debt and e uity securities Investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classied as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity in the fair value reserve, except for impairment losses and monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss.
w Interest bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
x Capitalisation of borrowing costs Borrowing costs interest and other costs are capitalised when they are incurred on raising specic funds to finance a major capital project, which will be a significant productive asset or, to the extent that funds borrowed generally are used for the purposes of obtaining a qualifying asset.
y Dividends Dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.

Impairment test for cash generating units containing goodwill For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Groups operating Divisions which represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill attributed to each Division is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Carbon 21.5 17.4 Technical Ceramics 72.1 20.1 Thermal Ceramics 22.5 17.5 Molten Metal Systems 2.3 2.1 118.4 57.1 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 92 Business review Governance Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 12.
Intangible assets continued Goodwill has been tested for impairment during 2008 on the following basis: The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed by reference to value in use.
Values in use have been estimated using cash ow projections based on budgeted operating results for the forthcoming year.
Cash ows for a further four year period are extrapolated using growth rates specic to each operating Division, ranging from 4.4% to 6.9%.
These growth rates reect the products, industries and countries in which the Divisions operate.
Given the similar risk proles of each of the operating Divisions, together with common funding from the central Group treasury function, a standard pre-tax discount rate of 13.0% based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, has been used in discounting the projected cash ows and calculating the terminal value at the end of year five.

Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: 3 Credit risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board delegates the establishment and implementation of the systems for internal control and risk management to the operating Divisions which are responsible for the identication and evaluation of significant risks applicable to their area of business together with the design and operation of suitable internal controls.
The Board delegates the monitoring and review of the internal control and risk management systems to the Audit Committee assisted by the Risk Management Committee.
The Risk Management Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial officer, reviews the full range of risks faced by Morgan Crucible as a Group, ensures there are adequate systems in place and evaluates their effectiveness.
Where necessary, the Risk Management Committee will initiate action to improve the systems and ensure compliance.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Group has set up notional cash pooling agreements with a number of banks.
Under the notional cash pooling agreement the Group has the legal right to offset liabilities on undrawn bank accounts against surplus balances.
As at 4 January 2009 the Group had no intention to settle these balances either simultaneously or on a net basis and hence the financial assets and liabilities within the notional cash pool are not presented on a net basis in the financial statements.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is inuenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an inuence on credit risk.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The Group serves thousands of customers.
Many of these have purchased the same product for several years and in some cases decades.
Others have modied and enhanced designs or adopted the same components into new products, extending the lifecycle of the components that the Group supply.
The Groups level of customer retention is very high, particularly with its major accounts and although the top 20 ranking will alter year to year, many of the same names remain consistent over time.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.
The main components of this allowance are a specic loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identied.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a sound credit rating.
Given these high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2008 2007 m m Available-for-sale financial assets 5.2 7.5 Loan to associate 36.0 36.0 Loans and receivables 164.5 114.8 Cash and cash equivalents 154.5 108.0 360.2 266.3 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 100 Business review Governance Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20.
Financial risk management continued The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by Division was: Carrying amount 2008 2007 m m Carbon 44.0 33.7 Technical Ceramics 33.5 19.3 Thermal Ceramics 81.3 55.7 Molten Metal Systems 5.7 6.1 164.5 114.8 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2008 2007 m m Europe 68.3 51.8 Americas 60.5 39.0 Far East & Australasia 34.3 22.5 Middle East & Africa 1.4 1.5 164.5 114.8 Impairment losses The aging of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2008 2007 m m Not past due 127.2 92.5 Past due 0-30 days 28.7 15.3 Past due 31-60 days 7.0 3.4 Past due 61-90 days 3.0 2.2 Past due more than 90 days 9.1 5.8 175.0 119.2 Impairment allowance 10.5 4.4 164.5 114.8 The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2008 2007 m m Balance at 5 January 4.4 4.8 Increase decrease in allowance for impairment 6.1 0.4 Balance at 4 January 10.5 4.4 Based on past experience, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due.
A specic impairment allowance may be created in respect of an individual trade receivable for which full recovery is doubtful.
As at 4 January 2009 and 4 January 2008 there were no specic impairment allowances that were significant to the Group.
In addition, local management may create a general impairment allowance to reect their experience of the historical recoverability of trade receivables past due in the respective markets in which their businesses operate.
The allowances in the accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible: at the point the amount is considered irrecoverable it is written-off against the financial asset directly.
Li uidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group seeks a balance between certainty of funding and a exible, cost-effective borrowing structure.
The policy is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquidity available to meet all foreseeable needs.

This drawing has been shown as due within one year as the loan matures on 12 January 2009.
The Bank Syndication extends to March 2010 and the Company has elected to roll these forward in accordance with the terms and conditions of the loan agreement.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Risk Management Committee.
Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.

Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk prole At the reporting date the interest rate prole of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Carrying amount 2008 2007 m m Fixed rate instruments Financial liabilities 287.5 127.0 Variable rate instruments Financial assets 154.4 108.0 Financial liabilities 157.3 100.7 2.9 7.3 The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that between 30% and 70% of its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on a xed rate basis.
Fair value sensitivity analysis for xed rate instruments The Group does not account for any xed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Cash ow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments A change of 100 basis points in interest rates on the outstanding Bank Syndication debt at the reporting date would have increased decreased profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2007. profit or loss 100 bp 100 bp increase decrease m m 4 January 2009 Variable rate instruments 1.4 1.4 Cash ow sensitivity net 1.4 1.4 4 January 2008 Variable rate instruments 0.7 0.7 Cash ow sensitivity net 0.7 0.7 Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the currency of the reporting unit.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily GBP, USD and Euro.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts: 2008 2007 GBP USD Euro GBP USD Euro Functional currency of Group operations m m m m m m Trade receivables 0.9 11.9 7.3 1.1 7.5 7.6 Cash and cash equivalents 0.6 21.4 12.0 0.3 15.5 14.5 Borrowings 96.1 74.8 Trade payables 5.3 7.5 3.3 4.5 6.2 3.5 Net balance sheet exposure 3.8 25.8 80.1 3.1 16.8 56.2 The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Year end rate 2008 2007 2008 2007 USD 1.8552 2.0003 1.4450 1.9742 Euro 1.2582 1.4615 1.0408 1.3363 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 103 Business review Governance Financial statements 20.
Financial risk management continued The Group aims to hedge all material trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.
At any point in time the Group also hedges up to 75% of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecasted sales and purchases over the following 12 months.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the currency of the reporting unit, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
Forecasted transactions The Group classies its forward exchange contracts used to hedge forecasted transactions as cash ow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted transactions at 4 January 2009 was 4.6 million 2007: 1.2 million, comprising assets of 0.2 million 2007: nil and liabilities of 4.8 million 2007: 1.2 million that were recognised in fair value derivatives.
Cash ow hedges The contractual cash ows associated with the forward exchange contracts that are designated as cash ow hedges are shown in the section on liquidity risk.
The impact on profit or loss is expected to occur at the same time as the associated cash ows.
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Group manages the translation exposure of overseas net assets by seeking to match the currency of borrowings with the currency in which the net assets are denominated.
The objectives are to maintain a low-cost of borrowing, whilst maintaining a balanced portfolio of net assets by currency.
The Group enters into forward contracts to hedge net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
The Group also designates the Euro drawdowns under the US$ 420 million Bank Syndication as a hedge of the Groups investment in subsidiaries in Europe.
Euro drawdowns during the year amounted to A100 million 2007: A100 million.
Sensitivity analysis A 10% strengthening of pounds sterling against the following currency net assets at the reporting date would have increased decreased equity by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2007.
Equity 2008 2007 m m USD 1.8 0.5 Euro 1.4 1.4 The impact of a one cent movement in the USD exchange rate on results that are reported in USD including those currencies that track the USD would be c. 1.7 million of revenue and 0.3 million of underlying operating profit.
Other market price risk Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held for partially meeting the unfunded portion of the Groups dened benefit pension obligations.
The primary goal of the Groups investment strategy is to maximise returns in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded dened benefit obligations.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base total equity so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board uses a number of measures, identied as key performance indicators KPI, to ensure the continued success of the Group.
The main KPI for the Group is the underlying profit margin.
The aim is to achieve mid-teen margins in good times and double digit margins when the environment is more challenging.
Another KPI, the economic value-added ratio EVA, compares the returns made by our Divisions with the notional cost of investing in them.
The Group uses this ratio to ascertain where to make capital investments within the Group.
The basic calculation deducts the cost of capital from the net operating profit after allowing for a notional medium-term tax charge.
The Board encourages employees of the Group to hold the Companys Ordinary shares.
The Group operates a number of employee share and share option schemes.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups various share option incentive schemes.
The Company has also acquired its own shares under a share buy-back programme.

Financial risk management continued There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

E uity securities Fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash ows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash ows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 105 Business review Governance Financial statements 20.
Financial risk management continued Interest rates used for determining fair value The interest rates used to determine the fair value of loans and borrowings and finance leases are as follows: 2008 2007 Loans and borrowings 2.0-4.0% 3.0-5.0% Finance leases 6.0% 6.0% 21.
Employee benets Morgan Crucible operates a number of dened benefit arrangements as well as dened contribution plans.

In making these estimates and assumptions, the Directors consider advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries.

Employee benets continued In 2007 additional performance criteria were attached to the Long Term Incentive Plan 2004.
The TSR performance criteria referred to above now only relate to 50% of the awards made.
The extent to which the other 50% of these awards vest will depend on the Companys Earnings per share EPS compared with the Retail Price Index RPI.
The full 50% will vest if over the three year performance period, the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 10% per annum.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and between 4% and 10% per annum then the proportion of awards vesting will be interpolated between 15% and 50%.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 4% per annum then 15% of the awards will vest.
If the Companys EPS increases by less than the sum of the RPI increase and 4% per annum then 0% of the awards will vest.
In 2008 further changes were made to the performance criteria attached to the Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 to awards made in 2008 and onwards.
For all participants excluding executive Directors the TSR performance criteria referred to above now only relates to 33.3% of awards made.
The extent to which the other 66.7% of these awards vest will depend on the Companys Earnings per share EPS compared with the Retail Price Index RPI.
The full 67% will vest if over the three year performance period, the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 10% per annum.
For executive Director participants the conditions remain unchanged from 2007.
In addition, an improvement must be shown in the Companys underlying financial performance.
Performance criteria for The Morgan Crucible Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan The extent to which awards will vest will depend on the Companys EPS compared with RPI.
Participants are able to defer up to 75% of their annual bonus into Company shares, subject to approval by the Remuneration Committee.
Under the 2008 grant, the Remuneration Committee allowed participants to defer up to 50% of their annual bonus into Company shares.
Participants must hold the deferred shares for three years to be eligible for a matching award.
Matching shares may be earned at the end of three years in the event that a stretching EPS target has been met.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 15% per annum then matching shares equal to three times the deferred shares will be earned.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and between 4% and 10% per annum then the proportion of awards will be interpolated between 0.25x deferred shares and 1.75x deferred shares.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 4% per annum then matching shares equal to 0.25x deferred shares will be earned.
Performance criteria for the Executive Share Option Scheme 199 The diluted earnings per share for the Company must grow by at least 2% per annum in excess of retail price ination over the period of date of grant to date of vesting.
The fair values of services received are in return for awards made and share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on an appropriate model as shown in the accounting policy note m.

Accounting estimates and judgments Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The following accounting estimates and judgments are subject to significant uncertainty.
Provisions Note 22 contains information about provisions.
Provisions for closure and restructuring costs, environmental issues and settlement of litigation are judgmental by their nature.
Amounts provided are the Groups best estimate of exposure based on currently available information.
Recognition of identiable intangible assets and goodwill Note 3 contains information about intangible assets recognised on acquisition.
These primarily relate to existing contracts and relationships, which are supported by long-term relationships with key customers.
The Group has estimated that these customer relationships have an economic life of 15-20 years.
Impairment of goodwill Note 12 contains information about the assumptions relating to goodwill impairment tests.
Credit risk Note 20 contains information about the Groups exposure to credit risk.
The Group establishes both specic and collective allowances for impairment losses against receivables.
The collective loss allowance is estimated based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Foreign currency exposure Note 20 contains information about the foreign currency exposure of the Group and risks in relation to foreign exchange movements.
Pension assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions applied to pensions are shown in note 21.
