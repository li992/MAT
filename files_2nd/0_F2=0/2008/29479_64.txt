Service Agreements It is the Committees policy that service agreements should not contain notice periods in excess of one year.
The terms and conditions of the Directors service agreements are reviewed regularly and all service agreements contain an express obligation on the executive to mitigate his loss in the event the agreement is terminated.
In addition, the Company reserves the right to pay an amount representing the value of salary and benefits in lieu of any outstanding period of notice on a monthly basis so that, should the executive obtain alternative employment during the notice period, the monthly payments can be reduced to take into account any earnings received under the new employment.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, for example illness.
All of the executive Directors have entered into a service agreement with the Company.
Each service agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
The agreements automatically terminate on the 65th birthday of the executive, except for Mike Wilson, whose agreement terminates on 31 December 2011, unless otherwise extended by mutual agreement.
All the service agreements provide for benefits in kind, including life assurance, pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
Mike Wilson is also entitled to the use of a chauffeur.
