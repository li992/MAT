The expected return on in-force is based on the unwind of the discount rate on the opening, adjusted base value of in-force VIF.
The opening base VIF of the Risk and Savings business was 3,460m in 2008.
This is adjusted for the effects of opening model changes -18m to give an adjusted opening base VIF of 3,442m.
This is then multiplied by the opening risk discount rate of 7.5% and the result grossed up at the notional attributed tax rate of 28% to give a return of 359m.
This is added to the expected return on the inforce of businesses acquired in the year 11m to give a total UK expected return of 370m.
The 2008 Group capital and financing contribution from shareholder net worth SNW of 256m reflects an average return on the average balance of invested assets.
This is offset by pre-tax corporate expenses charged to shareholders funds of 12m, and an adjustment for opening tax and other modelling changes of 10m.
Investment management operating profit excludes 35m 2007: 23m of profits arising from the provision of investment management services at market referenced rates to the covered business.
These are reported on a look through basis and as a consequence are included in the Risk, Savings and Group capital and financing covered business on an EEV basis.
O n an EEV basis Nationwide Life, Suffolk Life, operations in Ireland and business unit costs allocated to the Risk and Savings business are included in the covered business operating profit.
These are included within Other Risk and Other Savings operating profit on an IFRS basis.
In 2008 0.9bn was transferred from Shareholder Retained Capital to shareholder capital held outside Societys long term fund.
This transfer did not give rise to any incremental tax and therefore resulted in an 81m benefit to embedded value.
