The weighted average yield for each range of maturities in the above table is calculated by dividing the annualised interest income for the year ended 31 December 2008 by the book amount of available-for-sale debt securities at that date.
The yields do not include the effect of related derivatives.
20 Transfers of financial assets not qualifying for fide-recognition HSBC enters into transactions in the normal course of business by which it transfers recognised financial assets directly to third parties or to SPEs.
These transfers may give rise to the full or partial derecognition of the financial assets concerned.
Full derecognition occurs when HSBC transfers its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the right but assumes an obligation to pass on the cash flows from the asset, and transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
The risks include credit, interest rate, currency, prepayment and other price risks.
Partial derecognition occurs when HSBC sells or otherwise transfers financial assets in such a way that some but not substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred but control is retained.
These financial assets are recognised on the balance sheet to the extent of HSBCs continuing involvement.
The majority of financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition are i debt securities held by counterparties as collateral under repurchase agreements or ii equity securities lent under securities lending agreements.
The following table analyses the carrying amount of financial assets that did not qualify for derecognition and their associated financial liabilities: 405
