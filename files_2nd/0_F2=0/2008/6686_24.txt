The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking views of the financial markets suggested by the yields available, and the views of investment organisations.
Sensitivity analysis In making the valuation, the above assumptions have been used.
The following is an approximate sensitivity analysis of the impact of the change in the key assumptions.

Pensions continued The Directors were unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and then taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since the inception of the pension schemes.
Consequently the Directors are unable to determine the amounts of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group SORIE before 3 July 2004.

Financial risk management objectives and policies Financial risk factors and management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, hire purchase and finance lease contracts, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide an appropriate level of net debt to fund the Groups activities, namely working capital, fixed assets expenditure, acquisitions, dividends and share buy backs.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and fuel swaps.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and fuel price risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2008 and 2007, the Groups policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken and derivatives are only purchased for internal benefit.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and risks arising from fuel derivatives.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows and deposits funds and is exposed to changes in interest rates.
The Boards policy toward cash deposits is to deposit cash short term on UK money markets.
Interest payable on senior bank borrowings is based on re-fixing the rate of interest over short periods of time of up to six months.
During the year the Group has partially managed interest rate risk by hedging.
Excluding fixed rate debt, the Group has net borrowings and hence the present adverse risk is an increase in interest rates.
Details of interest rates are shown in note 28.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
Effect on Increase profit decrease in before tax basis points m 2008 GBP 50 0.7 GBP 50 0.7 2007 GBP 50 1.3 GBP 50 1.3 Liquidity risk During the year the Group replaced its 200m bilateral arrangements with a 340m syndicated facility.
This has increased the Groups liquidity to enable a higher level of gearing.
The level of draw down and prevailing interest rates are detailed in note 20.
The majority of the Groups road passenger vehicles are financed by hire purchase or finance lease arrangements, or term loans at fixed rates of interest over two to five year primary borrowing periods.
This provides a regular inflow of funding to cover expenditure as it arises.
Fuel derivatives The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of fuel usage.
The Group closely monitors fuel prices and uses fuel derivatives to hedge its exposure to increases in fuel prices, when it deems appropriate.
As at 28 June 2008 the Group had derivatives against bus fuel of 105.6 million litres for the year ending 27 June 2009, representing approximately 95% of the anticipated fuel usage in our bus business.
As at 28 June 2008 the Group also had derivatives against bus fuel for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 financial years of 49.9, 28.9 and 0.2 million litres respectively.
As at 28 June 2008 the Group had derivatives against rail fuel of 11.1 million litres for the year ending 27 June 2009 representing the anticipated fuel usage in London Midland.
As at 28 June 2008 the Group also had further derivatives for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 financial years of 10.7, 7.7 and 3.8 millions litres of rail fuel respectively.
The Groups hedging policy is to hedge 100%, 50% and 25% of anticipated bus fuel usage for the following year and two subsequent years.
The Group has met this target at the year ended 28 June 2008.
Foreign currency risk The Group rarely enters into transactions in foreign currency and no transaction to date has been material.
Should larger foreign currency transactions be undertaken, consideration would be given to hedging the foreign currency exchange risk.
The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 69 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group comprises the amounts presented in the balance sheet, which are stated net of provisions for doubtful debt.
A provision is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of future cashflows.
The majority of the Groups receivables are with public or quasi-public bodies such as the DfT.
The Group does not consider these counterparties to be a significant credit risk.
Outside of this, the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.
Contractual payments The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 28 June 2008 based on contractual undiscounted payments.
Year ended 28 June 2008 Less than 3 On demand months 3 to 12 months 1 to 5 years 5 years Total m m m m m m Interest bearing loans and borrowings 5.7 19.5 35.7 381.6 0.2 442.7 Trade and other payables 45.4 240.0 61.7 2.5 0.6 350.2 51.1 259.5 97.4 384.1 0.8 792.9 Year ended 30 June 2007 3 to 12 Less than 3 On demand months Months 1 to 5 years 5 years Total m m m m m m Interest bearing loans and borrowings 0.3 15.8 32.0 239.1 0.6 287.8 Trade and other payables 37.3 187.4 82.0 2.2 308.9  596.7 Managing capital The Group manages its capital structure such that net debt adjusted to exclude restricted cash, to EBITDA is within a range which retains an investment grade debt rating.
Adjusted net debt at the year end was 320.7m 2007 237.2m, equivalent to 1.65x 2007 1.46x EBITDA in line with the Groups aim to move to an adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x to 2.5x through the cycle.
Operating leases The Group uses operating leases for bus and coach purchases across the Group primarily where the vehicles service specific contracts to mitigate the risk of ownership at the end of the contract.
This results in 0.4m 2007 0.4m of cost within operating charges which would otherwise have been charged to interest.
The Group holds operating leases for its bus fleet with an asset capital value of 6.4m 2007 10.1m.
The majority of assets in the rail division are financed by operating leases, in particular rolling stock.
Leases are entered into by the respective operating companies and are not the subject of parent company guarantees.
Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial instruments carried in the financial statements have been reviewed as at 28 June 2008 and are as follows: 2008 2007 Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value m m m m Fuel price derivatives 27.3 27.3 0.7 0.7 Fixed rate debt 25.5 23.9 43.1 40.7 1.8 3.4 42.4 40.0 The fair value of all other assets and liabilities in notes 18,19 and 20 is not significantly different to their carrying amount.
The fuel price derivatives were valued externally by the respective banks by comparison with the market fuel price at the relevant date.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cashflows at prevailing rates.
Hedging activities At the year end, the Group had various fuel price swaps in place.
For the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 financial years cashflow hedges were placed over 116.7, 60.6, 36.6 and 4.0 million litres of fuel respectively.
The fair value of the asset has been recognised on the balance sheet.
The value has been generated since the date of the acquisition of the instruments due to the movement in market fuel prices.
The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 70 The gains and losses on instruments used for hedging fuel price risk are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
The movement in the period is shown below.
During the year, the Group took out a variable interest rate swap on a 100m drawdown of the syndicated loan.
This was designated as a cashflow hedge of the interest on the loan.
The cashflow hedge did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the loss of 0.2m was recognised in the income statement.
The swap was closed out on 10 June 2007.

The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

Pension commitments Defined contribution: The Company participates in the defined contribution scheme of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
This scheme is not contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and is open to new entrants.
The expense recognised in these accounts for the year is 0.1m 2007 0.1m being the contributions paid and payable.
Defined benefit: The Company participates in a scheme which is part of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2006 and was updated by Watson Wyatt LLP to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 28 June 2008 and 30 June 2007.
The contributions paid to the scheme are paid in line with the schedule of contributions, being 13.3% and 11.2% of pensionable salaries paid to upper and lower tier sections respectively.
The defined benefit scheme is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future, as a percentage of payroll.
However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.
The scheme is a multi employer scheme and in accordance with FRS 17, the Company has accounted for its contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme because it is not possible to identify the Companys share of the net assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis due to the high volume of members pensioners and the historic interaction between group companies.
The following disclosures provide details of the entire defined benefit scheme.
