They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Pension costs The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
The scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997.
The company accounts for pension costs in line with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The amounts charged to operating profit regarding the defined benefit scheme are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the benefits have vested.
If the benefits do not vest immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs.
The interest costs and the expected return on the assets are shown as a net amount of other financial costs or credits adjacent to interest.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair values and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the Projected Unit Credit Method, and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities.
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
The resulting defined benefit asset or liability, net of related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the balance sheet.
Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year-end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year-end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of the transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow statement No cash flow statement is prepared for the company under FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements as the cash flows of the company have been included in the group cash flow statement of Premier Oil plc.
Related party transactions The company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures with regard to the nondisclosure of transactions between group companies.
Share-based payments The company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The company issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled sharebased payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the binomial model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised as the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date for cash-settled share-based payments.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 81 1 Significant accounting policies continued Sales revenue Sales of petroleum production are recognised when goods are delivered or the title has passed to the customer.
Tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Fixed assets Oil and gas assets a Development and production assets Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Depreciation of producing assets The net book values of producing assets are depreciated generally on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method by reference to the ratio of production in the period and the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
Pipelines are depreciated on a unit-of-throughput basis.
b Impairment of development and production assets An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying amount is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves.
The cash generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
c Decommissioning Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full at the commencement of oil and gas production.
The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
A corresponding tangible fixed asset is also created at an amount equal to the provision.
This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production facilities.
Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the fixed asset.
Stock and underlift Non-production related stocks are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Under and overlifts of crude oil are recorded at market value.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 82 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2008 1 Significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The company accounts for derivative financial instruments in line with FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The company uses derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its exposure to oil price fluctuations.
All derivatives are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs.
Derivatives are subsequently carried at fair value.
All changes in fair value are recorded as financial income or expense in the year in which they arise.
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arms length transaction.
It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated transaction costs that would be incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows.
2 Profit for the year As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year.
Premier Oil plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2008 of US$87.0 million 2007: profit of US$74.2 million.
The auditors remuneration for audit services to the company was US$10,000 2007: US$10,000.

Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.

Further details of this plan are disclosed in note 11.
The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred between 2009 and 2017.
These provisions have been created based on Premiers internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
9 Pension liability 2008 2007 $ million $ million UK funded pension scheme 2.0 2.6 UK unfunded pension scheme 0.8 1.1 Total liability in balance sheet 2.8 3.7 The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
As a consequence of being closed to new entrants, the current service costs of the Scheme under the FRS 17 Retirement Benefits valuation will increase as the members approach retirement.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 85 9 Pension liability continued The pension costs for the Scheme are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The most recent formal valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2008 using the Attained Age Method and a market-related funding basis, of which the principal financial assumptions were investment return: 5.9 per cent pa, salary growth: 5.4 per cent pa and pension increases: 3.4 per cent pa.
The market value of the Schemes assets was 14.9 million and, on the specific method and assumptions adopted, the assets covered 91 per cent of the members accrued benefits based on projected pensionable salaries.
Until October 2008, the employer contributed to the Scheme at the rate of 19 per cent of pensionable salaries together with an additional 28,000 paid per month.
In October a new Schedule of Contributions was put in place.
At this point the employer paid a one-off lump sum contribution of 1.3 million and started to contribute at a rate of 25 per cent of pensionable salaries with no additional monthly amounts.
The employer expects to contribute 95,000 to the Scheme in 2009.
The following figures have been prepared in compliance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits incorporating the amendment announced in December 2006 by an independent actuary on the basis of membership data current as at 31 December 2008 but taking account of pension increases effected on 1 January 2009.
The benefit obligations and service cost have been measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The principal financial assumptions adopted for this actuarial valuation were: Rate of investment return: 5.9% pa Rate of salary increases: 5.4% pa Rate of pension increases: 3.4% pa Employee benefit obligations The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: At 31 At 31 December December 2008 2007 $ million $ million Present value of funded obligations 22.7 31.9 Fair value of Scheme assets 20.7 29.3 Deficit before allowing for deferred tax 2.0 2.6 The amounts recognised in profit and loss are as follows: 2008 2007 $ million $ million Current service cost 0.2 0.3 Interest on obligation 1.7 1.7 Expected return on Scheme assets 1.9 1.7 Total 0.3 Actual return on Scheme assets 3.2 1.3 A total loss of US$2.4 million 2007: gain of US$0.2 million was recognised directly in equity during the year.

As at 31 December 2008, a one percentage point change in this assumption would have had the following effects on the closing defined benefit obligation: Discount rate: 6.0% pa Discount rate: Discount rate: as used for report 5.0% pa 7.0% pa $ million $ million $ million Defined benefit obligation 22.7 27.4 19.2 5 year historic record: 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million Defined benefit obligation 22.7 31.9 31.4 28.1 25.1 Fair value of Scheme assets 20.7 29.3 28.0 21.1 18.9 Deficit in the Scheme 2.0 2.6 3.4 7.0 6.2 Experience adjustments on Scheme liabilities 0.6 0.1 0.7 Experience adjustments on Scheme assets 5.1 0.4 0.2 1.6 0.2 Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 87 9 Pension liability continued Unfunded pensions In addition, the company is paying an unfunded pension to a former director of the company in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouses pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Schemes pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2008 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of unfunded pensions is US$0.8 million 2007: US$1.1 million.
A total gain of US$0.3 million 2007: loss of US$0.1 million was recognised directly in equity during the year.
10 Capital commitments and guarantees At 31 December 2008 the company had commitments for performance guarantees totalling US$nil 2007: US$4.6 million, US$0.1 million as retainer fees for its alliance partners 2007: US$0.1 million, and customs guarantees of US$0.3 million 2007: US$0.4 million.
The company, together with certain subsidiary undertakings, has jointly guaranteed the groups borrowing facilities of US$275 million and 53 million, maturing on 31 July 2010.

Following the increase in share capital the 9,487,320 authorised but unissued Non-Voting Convertible Shares of 17.5 pence each were consolidated and redesignated as 3,320,562 Ordinary Shares of 50 pence each in the capital of the company, carrying the rights and being subject to the restrictions set out in the Articles of Association of the company.
Share-based payments Shares issued relate to the companys share option plans.
There has been no new issue of shares in relation to the Asset and Equity Plan.
Share option plans The company has share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the companys shares have been granted to certain executives and employees.
Options granted are normally exercisable not less than three years after their grant and will lapse on their tenth anniversary.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the scheme.
Employees can save to a maximum of 250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.

The remaining 75,349 Ordinary Shares were issued from the Premier Oil plc Employee Benefit Trust 2007: nil.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 2.15.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2008 had a weighted average exercise price of 4.69 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.6 years.
The fair value of the options granted during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is not material.
The company recognised a cost of US$20.1 million and US$7.8 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2008 and 2007 respectively.
Asset and Equity Plan The Asset and Equity Plan is designed to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period and is operated by reference to two bonus pools an equity bonus pool and an asset bonus pool.
The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share of the company over a three-year period.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 29.0% to 31.5% Risk free rate of interest: 4.1% to 4.9% Historic market value growth factor: 99.0% to 109.0% For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the total cost recognised by the company for share-based payments is US$12.8 million 2007: US$10.4 million with a cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$9.5 million 2007: US$12.3 million.
A credit of US$20.1 million has been recorded in equity 2007: US$7.8 million for all equity-settled payments for the company and its subsidiaries.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil group.
Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the profit and loss account as exploration expense, operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
Ordinary Shares The rights and restrictions attached to the Ordinary Shares are as follows: Dividend rights The rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other in relation to dividends.
Winding up or reduction of capital On a return of capital on a winding up or otherwise other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares the rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares to participate in the distribution of the assets of the company available for distribution shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other.
Voting rights The holders of Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at any General Meeting of the company.
