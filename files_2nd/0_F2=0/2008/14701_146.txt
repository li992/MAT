The comparative weighted average number of shares has been adjusted for the impact of reverse acquisition accounting as set out in note 1, Basis of Preparation.
Share awards granted in April 2007 were non-dilutive as at 27 April 2008 as the prospect of the performance conditions attached to these awards being satisfied is considered to be remote.
As a result share awards are not taken into account when determining the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period and therefore the basic and diluted earnings per share are the same.

Underlying earnings is used by management as a measure of profitability within the Group.
Underlying earnings is defined as profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent for each financial period but excluding realised foreign exchange profit or loss, the re-valuation required under IFRS in respect of forward exchange contracts, and the post tax effect of certain exceptional items.
The directors believe that the underlying earnings before exceptional items and underlying earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on the underlying performance of the business, and are consistent with how business performance is measured internally.
Underlying earnings is not a recognised profit measure under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures used by other companies.
