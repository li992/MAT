EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of shares under the Groups long term incentive plan.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of Ordinary shares used in the calculations are set out below: From continuing operations 2008 2007 Weighted Earnings Weighted Earnings average per average per number of Ordinary number of Ordinary Earnings shares share Earnings shares share m millions pence m millions pence Profit before exceptional items attributable to shareholders of the parent and for basic EPS 36.0 130.9 27.5 24.1 130.4 18.5 Exceptional items after tax 39.2 2.1 Loss profit attributable to shareholders of the parent and for basic EPS 3.2 130.9 2.5 22.0 130.4 16.9 Effect of dilutive shares: Options 3.7 4.7 Long term incentive plan 0.5 0.4 Diluted EPS 3.2 135.1 2.4 22.0 135.5 16.2 From continuing and discontinued operations 2008 2007 Weighted Earnings Weighted Earnings average per average per number of Ordinary number of Ordinary Earnings shares share Earnings shares share m millions pence m millions pence Profit before exceptional items attributable to shareholders of the parent and for basic EPS 74.2 130.9 56.7 59.5 130.4 45.6 Exceptional items after tax 178.9 2.1 Profit attributable to shareholders of the parent and for basic EPS 253.1 130.9 193.4 57.4 130.4 44.0 Effect of dilutive shares: Options 3.7 4.7 Long term incentive plan 0.5 0.4 Diluted EPS 253.1 135.1 187.4 57.4 135.5 42.3 62
