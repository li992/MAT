Pension arrangements HMV Group employees are members of a number of pension schemes.
The main scheme that covers employees in the United Kingdom is the HMV Group Pension Scheme the Scheme established with effect from July 1998.
The Scheme has two sections the Pension Benefit Section and the Pension Saver Section.
There is also a small defined benefit pension arrangement in Ireland, which is included in the Group amounts disclosed below, but is not included in the Company amounts.
Pension Benefit Section The Pension Benefit Section is of the defined benefit type and is an Inland Revenue exempt approved scheme for the purpose of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
It is contracted out of SERPS.
The benefits it provides are based on final pensionable pay and are guaranteed to increase in payment by 5% per annum or by the increase in the cost of living, if less.
Members currently contribute at the rate of 5% of pensionable pay.
A valuation is undertaken on at least a triennial basis by a qualified actuary.
The most recently completed actuarial valuation was as at 30 June 2004 and was based on an assumed investment return of 6.5% a year, salary increases of 4.25% a year, and annual pension increases of 2.75%, and used the projected unit method.
The result of the valuation was a level of asset cover of 79%, representing a funding deficit of 11.5m, which was funded by three 4.4m special contributions, the last of which was paid on 31 May 2006.
The market value of the assets of the Pension Benefit Scheme at 30 June 2004 was about 43.9m.
In addition, the funding rate was set at 19.9% of pensionable pay including an allowance for administrative expenses.
Therefore from 1 July 2005, the Group has been contributing at a rate of 14.9% of pensionable pay, with the members contributing at 5% of pensionable pay.
The actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2007 is now close to completion.
Following this, the next actuarial review will take place no later than 30 June 2010.

Pension arrangements continued The Pension Benefit Section was generally closed to new members with effect from 1 January 2002, with the exception of 543 members who transferred into the Scheme on 31 May 2003 from the EMI Group Pension Fund as a result of the Groups flotation on the London Stock Exchange.
Actual employer contributions to the Pension Benefit Section for the year ended 26 April 2008 were 2.6m 2007: 7.2m inclusive of a 4.4m special contribution.
The total employer contributions to the defined benefit plans for the financial year commencing on 27 April 2008 are expected to be 3.1m.
Pension Saver Section The Pension Saver Section is of the defined contribution type and is open to all permanent and temporary staff of the Group aged between 18 and 64 years.
Members can choose to pay from 2% to 5% of pensionable pay.
The Group matches the amount paid by the member up to a maximum of 5% of pensionable pay.
Members have a choice of ways to invest their and the Groups contributions in an individual fund to buy pension benefits of their choice.
Actual employer contributions to the Pension Saver Section for the year ended 26 April 2008 were 0.9m 2007: 0.8m.
In addition, employer contributions to similar pension arrangements in HMVs international businesses totalled 0.5m 2007: 0.4m Defined benefit pensions Amounts reflected in the financial statements in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt LLP, on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit funding method.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at the respective balance sheet dates.
The major assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: As at As at 26 April 2008 28 April 2007 % per annum % per annum Rate of price inflation 3.5 3.1 Rate of salary increase 5.0 4.6 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.3 3.1 Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 6.2 5.4 Expected rate of return on equities 8.1 7.8 Expected rate of return on bonds 6.2 5.4 Expected rate of return on index-linked bonds 4.6 4.4 The expected rate of return on Scheme assets is based on consistent assumptions with the previous year, adjusted to reflect changes in market conditions since that date.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions used as at 26 April 2008 are in line with the proposed basis of the draft actuarial funding valuation as at 30 June 2007.
They reflect the pensioner mortality 00 series tables rated up one year and based on year of use with allowance for medium cohort improvements applying from 2000 subject to a minimum of 1% per annum.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions used as at 28 April 2007 were the standard PM FA92 series tables with allowance for future improvements in mortality.
These bases imply the following life expectancies: 2008 2008 2007 2007 At age 65 for At age 65 for At age 60 for At age 60 for someone someone someone someone currently currently currently currently Life expectancy years aged 65 aged 50 aged 60 aged 40 Male 21.3 23.1 23.9 25.9 Female 23.6 25.5 27.2 29.0 Other non-financial assumptions are consistent with those used in the last complete actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 June 2004.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the Scheme deficit of 17.4m, recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity in the Group, is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the Scheme.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 25 April 2004.
