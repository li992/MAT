5. recoverable vat continued The amounts recoverable by the Manager on behalf of the Company, and the timing of the recoveries, are dependent upon negotiations between the Manager and HMRC, on the one hand, and between the Manager and the Company on the other.
Taking into account HMRCs acceptance of the ECJ and Cond Nast decisions, the Directors believe that the negotiations with the Manager have reached a position of clarity such that the Company is certain of recovering at least 2m of VAT via the Manager in respect of the periods since April 2001.
This sum has been recognised as a separate item within the Income Statement in the current year.
The Directors are unable to state with any degree of certainty the extent to which they believe the Manager will recover, on the Companys behalf, VAT in respect of the periods from 1990 to 1996 and interest in respect of all VAT claims.
