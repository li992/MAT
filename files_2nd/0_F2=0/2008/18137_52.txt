65 CLS Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 13 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares held as treasury shares see Note 23.
The weighted average number of shares for the year was 64,783,048 2007: 71,091,971.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding assuming conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Potential ordinary shares are treated as dilutive only when their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or increase loss per share from continuing operations.
Where the conversion of potential shares would have the opposite effect by increasing earnings per share or decreasing loss per share from continuing operations, they are considered to be antidilutive and so are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
Instruments that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they are antidilutive for the year ended 31 December 2008 comprise share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
The effect of these antidilutive securities would have been to increase weighted average shares by 110,877 shares 2007: 405,000 shares were treated as dilutive.
There were no share options remaining at 31 December 2008.
