IFRS 8 is mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2009.
This IFRS requires an entity to adopt the management approach to reporting on the financial performance of its operating segments.
It is not anticipated that there will be any significant financial impact on the financial statements, although additional disclosures will be required.
The Group plans to adopt this standard in the year ending 30th June 2010.

Goodwill and other intangible assets Business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
In respect of business acquisitions, goodwill arising on acquisition represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and contingent liabilities acquired, net of deferred tax.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
It is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower.
Impairment losses are recognised through the Consolidated income statement.
Intangible assets such as customer lists, patents, trademarks, know how and intellectual property that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets.
The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets included in the Consolidated balance sheet reflect the benefit derived by the Group and vary from 5 to 10 years.

For the testing of impairment of goodwill, the Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts and plans relating to the businesses to which the goodwill relates.
These cash flows are extrapolated forward based on estimated growth rates applicable to the business units and then discounted to the present value at a discount rate of 10%.
As noted in the Financial review, the Group is investing 4,850,000 in a start-up company, D3 Technologies limited D3, over a period of five years.
This comprises an initial investment in newly-issued shares of 1,680,000 along with further investment of 3,170,000.
The legal costs associated with the acquisition amounted to 62,000.
This additional investment will comprise deferred consideration in the form of the supply of spectroscopy equipment at a fair value of 2,820,000 and further contingent cash consideration of 350,000.
This cash investment will be dependent on D3 achieving specified performance targets.
The initial investment gave the Company a 75% shareholding in D3, with the minority shareholders having paid par value for their 25% interest.
Under the Shareholders agreement additional shares will be issued to the minority shareholders, at their option, subject to D3 achieving specific performance targets.
This may result in the Companys shareholding being diluted from 75% to 64.5%.
Goodwill arises from the recognition of the entitlement of the minority to up to a 35.5% shareholding in D3 for a nominal consideration.
This represents the cost to the Group of acquiring D3 as follows: Total amount Goodwill 000 000 1,680 420 Amount invested up to June 2008 note 19 3,170 1,302 Deferred consideration note 34 note 18 4,850 1,722 Total expected investment In the period from the date of investment to 30th June 2008, D3 generated income of 53,000 and suffered a loss of 400,000.

14. empLoyee beneFiTs The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The major scheme, which covers the UK-based employees, was of the defined benefit type.
In April 2007, this scheme ceased any future accrual for current members and was closed to new members.
UK employees are now covered by a defined contribution scheme.

Currency translation reserve The currency translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign operations, offset by foreign exchange differences on bank liabilities which have been accounted for directly in equity on account of them being classified as hedging items.
Cash flow hedging reserve The cash flow hedging reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the valuation of forward exchange contracts which are effective hedges and mature after the year end.
These are valued on a mark-to-market basis and are accounted for directly in equity and are recycled through the Consolidated income statement when the hedged item affects the Consolidated income statement.

FinanCiaL insTrumenTs The Group has exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk arising from its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to these risks, along with the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risks.
Credit risk The Group carries a credit risk, being the risk of non-payment of trade receivables by its customers.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all new customers before credit is given above certain thresholds.
There is a spread of risks among a large number of customers with no significant concentration with one customer.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
An analysis by currency of Group financial assets at the year end is as follows: Trade receivables Other receivables Net cash Currency 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 000 000 Pounds Sterling 4,294 6,154 3,700 2,989 77,170 51,172 US Dollar 13,177 11,364 219 155 13,178 10,632 Japanese Yen 5,234 6,093 246 137 9,325 9,299 Euro 14,539 11,873 624 2,973 17,816 12,281 Other 5,559 2,396 737 551 1,332 1,801 42,803 37,880 5,526 6,805 38,183 20,761 The ageing of gross trade receivables at the end of the year was: 2008 2007 000 000 Not past due 32,104 28,264 Past due 0 -1 month 6,579 5,349 Past due 1 - 2 months 2,880 2,808 Past due more than 2 months 2,936 3,110 Balance at the end of the year 44,499 39,531 Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables during the year were: 2008 2007 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 1,651 1,589 Changes in amounts provided 444 242 Amounts utilised 399 180 Balance at the end of the year 1,696 1,651 Liquidity risk The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is highly cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements.
In respect of net cash, the carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings.
Interest rates are floating and based on libor libid.
The contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the year end were: Carrying Up to 1 year 1 - 2 years 2 - 5 years amount 000 000 000 000 12,691 - - Trade payables 12,691 2,178 - - Current tax 2,178 13,715 - - Other payables 13,715 1,938 1,878 2,090 Forward exchange contracts 5,906 30,522 1,878 2,090 34,490 The contracted cash flows for the financial liabilities are the same as the carrying values.
For 2007, all financial liabilities had maturities within one year.
There is no difference between the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and their carrying value in the balance sheet.
FinanCiaL insTrumenTs: ConTinueD market risk As noted in the Financial review under Risks and uncertainties, the Group operates in a number of foreign currencies with the majority of sales being made in these currencies but with a concentration of manufacturing in the UK, Ireland and India.
exchange rates and sensitivity analysis The main exchange rates having an effect on the Groups results are the US Dollar and Japanese Yen.
The Group has hedged the majority of its forecasted Euro cash flows and hence there is not a significant impact on the Groups results resulting from fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate.
The following are the exchange rates which have been applicable during the financial year.
Also noted is the increase in profit that a one US Dollar cent and one Japanese Yen change in exchange rate, where the foreign currency is strengthening against Sterling, might have on the Groups results.
The method of estimation involves assessing the impact of these currencies on the Groups transactions assuming all other variables are unchanged.

Further details are noted in the Treasury policies on page 32. net assets and associated borrowings The Group maintains foreign currency borrowings as a method of providing hedging against the currency translation risk of the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries.
The level of hedging in place at the year end for the major currencies and their relative base borrowing interest rates, were: Base Net assets of Currency borrowing subsidiary borrowing interest rate Currency 000 000 % US Dollar 17,710 17,410 2.0% Japanese Yen 10,486 10,845 0.5% Euro 23,590 22,160 4.2% The currency borrowings are short-term, with floating interest rates.
In order to minimise the cost of these borrowings, short-term currency swaps are used on a rolling one-month cycle.
These currency swaps are not reflected in the table above.
The Company has Euro forward contracts which mature after the balance sheet date.
The fair value of these contracts at the year end was a loss of 4,252,000 2007 profit 1,845,000 see note 20.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base and to maintain a balance between significant returns to shareholders, with a progressive dividend policy, whilst ensuring the security of the Group supported by a sound capital position.
