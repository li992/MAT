Goodwill acquired through business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash ows of these cash-generating units.
The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Americas business segment 168.6 123.6 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the EMEA business segment 5.0 3.1 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Asia Pacific business segment 10.6 7.7 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the UK business segment 90.3 88.6 274.5 223.0 The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to two cash-generating units, the USA and UK, is material relative to the total carrying value comprising 90% of the total.
The remaining 10% of the carrying value is allocated to a further 23 countries 23 cashgenerating units.
The goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to the USA and the UK cash-generating units is set out below: Goodwill Intangible assets 2008 2007 m m m m USA 156.1 156.1 112.9 UK 90.3 11.2 101.5 99.8 Other cash-generating units 28.1 28.1 21.5 274.5 11.2 285.7 234.2 The indefinite life intangible asset relates to the brand value arising from the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended 31 December 2006 see note 13.
The recoverable amount of each of the cash-generating units above has been determined based on their value in use, calculated as the present value of future cash ows attributable to the unit.
The value in use for each cash-generating unit has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each unit from the value in use of the Group as a whole.
Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management, it also reects external factors, such as capital market risk pricing as reected in the market capitalisation of the Group, and prevailing tax rates, which have been used to determine the risk-adjusted discount rate for the Group.
As the model reects current market risk factors, management believe that the the actual performance of the business is more likely than not to exceed the projections used in the value in use model in the medium to long term.
However, as described below, in the event that trading conditions deteriorate beyond the assumptions used in the projections, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods.
com Financial Statements The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each group of cash-generating units: future cash ows are based on budgets for 2009 approved by the Board and have been adjusted for specic risks and uncertainties identied for each cash-generating unit.
The model excludes cost savings and restructurings that are anticipated but had not been committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use.
Thereafter forecasts have been prepared by management for a further four years that reect a steady growth rate of 3% and an unchanged underlying gross margin before adjusting for the effect of an anticipated modest recovery in global economic conditions from 2011.
This compared to forecasts used in the model in the year ended 31 December 2007 that projected improving margins throughout the first five years of the model with steady growth thereafter.
Therefore the current cash ow projections take a more cautious approach than the projections used in 2007.
These forecasts exclude the impact of both organic and acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods.
As a result gross margins and real operating profits at the end of the five year period remain either at or below the levels achieved in the year ended 31 December 2008.
Management consider these projections to be a cautious projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle position reecting the current uncertain global economic conditions.
Cash ows beyond 2013 have been extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which does not exceed the longterm growth rate for any of the markets in which the relevant cash-generating units operate.
a terminal value is included in the assessment reecting the Groups expectation that it will continue to operate in these markets and the long term nature of the businesses.
a country specic pre-tax discount rate was applied to the future pre-tax cash ows for each cash-generating unit based on an underlying post-tax discount rate for the Group.
The pre-tax rate therefore reects current market assessments of the Group as a whole and is adjusted for risks specic to such businesses in each country.
The Group post-tax rate used as the base for the pre-tax discount rate was 16% 2007:12%.
The increase compared to the prior year reected an increase in the market risk adjustment caused by the current market capitalisation of the Group.
The underlying weighted average cost of capital for the Group, before the market risk adjustment, was unchanged from 2007 at 9%.
The trading conditions in which the Group operates are subject to competitive and economic pressures that can have a material effect on the operating performance of the business.
Current market conditions are more challenging for the Group and the current global conditions make forecasting medium term cash ows more difficult than is traditionally the case.
The forecast cash ows used to derive the value in use are sensitive to changes in revenues driven by changes in prices, occupancy or a combination of both, costs and discount rates including the market assessment of the risks of the Group reected in the Groups market capitalisation.
Actual conditions could result in either better or worse cash ows than included in the value in use calculation.
Should current economic conditions prove to be more severe or more prolonged than currently expected this would adversely impact the forecast cash ows and could result in impairments to goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in future periods.
It is not possible to predict the extent of such possible impairments.
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a significant nature so as to result in most cash-generating units carrying amount exceeding the recoverable amount.
For the USA and UK cash-generating units, a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used to determine the cash-generating units recoverable amount could cause the units carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the USA, the goodwill in this cash-generating unit arose on acquisitions completed since 2004 principally the acquisition of HQ Global Workplaces in 2004.
The recoverable amount exceeded its carrying amount by $51 million and therefore no impairment was necessary at 31 December 2008.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash ows were based included the impact of the economic downturn in the short term on revenues and margins: the mid-cycle revenue achieved in 2013 prior to the application of the long-run growth rate of 2%: and the discount rate used.
The model assumes a decrease in gross margins in 2009 and 2010 from 28% in 2008 to 20% and a fall in operating profits from $103 million in 2008 to $40 million in 2009.
A further fall in gross margins in 2009 and 2010 by five points to 15% equating to an operating profit of $8 million with recovery to a gross margin of 22% in 2011 would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount.
The model assumes a mid-cycle gross margin in 2013 of 23% and an operating profit of $71.7 million.
A reduction to 21% and $54.7 million would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount.
The cash ows have been discounted using a post-tax discount rate of 15% pre-tax 18%: 2007: 20%.
The discount rate used is lower than the risk adjusted rate for the Group of 16% reecting the mature nature of the Regus business in the USA and the competitive environment.
An increase in the pre-tax discount rate used from 18% to 22% would result in its recoverable amount being equal to its carrying amount.
For the UK, the goodwill in this cash-generating unit arose on acquisitions completed since 2006 principally the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in 2006.
The recoverable amount exceeded its carrying amount by 18 million and therefore no impairment was necessary at 31 December 2008.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash ows were based included the impact of the economic downturn in the short term on revenues and margins: the mid-cycle revenue achieved in 2013 prior to the application of the long-run growth rate: and the discount rate used.
The model assumes a decrease in gross margins in 2009 and 2010 from 19% in 2008 to 15% and a fall in underlying operating profits from 18.4 million in 2008 to 11.6 million in 2009.
A further fall in gross margins in 2009 and 2010 by four points to 11% equating to an operating profit of 3.6 million with recovery to a gross margin of 17% in 2011 would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount.
The model assumes a mid-cycle gross margin in 2013 of 18% and an operating profit of 21.7 million.
A reduction to 16% and 15.7 million would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount.
The cash ows have been discounted using a post-tax discount rate of 16% pre-tax 19%: 2007: 17%.
The discount rate used is in line with the risk-adjusted rate for the Group reecting the mature nature of the Regus business in the UK and the greater degree of competition in the market.
An increase in the pre-tax discount rate used from 19% to 22% would result in its recoverable amount being equal to its carrying amount.
There is no goodwill relating to the Groups joint ventures.
Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 57 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 13.
The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that the value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group.
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indefinite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis.
The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the recoverable amount note 12. of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business see 58 www.

Financial instruments and financial risk management The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments and the management of capital are determined at Group level.
The Groups Board maintains overall responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the Chief Financial officer is responsible for policy on a day to day basis.
The Chief Financial officer and Group Treasurer review the Groups risk management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis.
The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility for applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Groups risk management policies.
The Audit Committee is supported by the Head of Risk Management in performing this role.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of business.
The principal financial instruments used by the Group to finance its operations are cash and loans.
Going concern The Business Review on pages 6 to 15 of the Report and Accounts sets out the Groups strategy and the factors that are likely to affect the future performance and position of the business.
The Financial Review on pages 16 to 19 within the Business Review includes a review of the trading performance, financial position and cash ows of the Group.
A feature of the Group has been its strong cash ows during the year ended 31 December 2008 and its cash balance at that date.
Although many countries that the Group operates in are experiencing increasingly difficult economic conditions, the directors believe that the Group is taking the necessary actions and expect to strengthen the current market leading position of the Group.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Following an internal review of the Groups facility arrangements in March 2009, and given the strength of the Groups cash position, the Board approved the early surrender of the 100 million revolving credit facility.
The decision does not impact the judgement of the directors that it is appropriate for the Group to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these accounts.
Credit risk Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises principally in relation to customer contracts and the Groups cash deposits.
A diversied customer base and requirement for customer deposits and payments in advance on workstation contracts which contribute the majority of the Groups revenue minimise the Groups exposure to customer credit risk.
No single customer contributes a material percentage of the Groups revenue.
The Groups policy is to provide against trade receivables when specic debts are judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced.
A provision is created where debts are more than three months overdue which reects the Groups historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables.
These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.
Cash assets and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, analysed by geographic region, is summarised below.
2008 2007 m m Americas 28.4 19.9 EMEA 51.3 33.0 UK 21.6 22.0 Asia Pacic 14.2 11.5 115.5 86.4 All of the Groups trade receivables relate to customers purchasing workplace solutions and no individual customer has a material balance owing as a trade receivable.
com Financial Statements During the year ended 31 December 2008, the Group provided for an additional 5.5 million against potential bad debts 2007: 3.1 million and utilised 2.6 million directly against the balance of trade receivables 2007: 2.7 million.
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority of its revenue in advance of the provision of ofce services and requires deposits from its customers.
Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by reviewing its global cash position on a weekly basis and expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
In addition to free cash excluding blocked cash of 205.4 million 2007: 128.5 million the Group has an undrawn senior committed facility of 100.0 million 2007: 136.0 million.
The Groups undrawn senior committed facility of 100.0 million expires on 19 March 2011, subject to the Group continuing to comply with the covenants under the facility agreement.
These covenants include the ratio of net debt to EBITDA: the ratio of cash ow to net debt service including the net interest expense and scheduled debt repayments : and the ratio of EBITDAR to net interest and rental charges.
The Group does not anticipate that any of the covenants in the facility will be breached in the foreseeable future.
In March 2009, the Board approved the early surrender of the 100 million revolving credit facility following an internal review of the Groups facility arrangements.
Of the facility approximately 50 million had been set aside to support bank guarantees provided against obligations of the Group.
In order to continue to support these, the Group will deposit sufficient funds with the guaranteeing banks which will reduce cash available for use by an equivalent amount.
The directors do not believe that this decision will have an adverse impact on the Groups liquidity given the strength of the Groups cash position.
Even though the Group has net current liabilities, the directors do not consider that this gives rise to a liquidity risk.
A large proportion of the net current liabilities comprise balances such as deferred income, acquisition related fair value adjustments and rent adjustments that represent deferred items to be recognised in future periods through the income statement.
Although the Group holds customer deposits of 174.8 million which are refundable to customers, these are spread across a large number of customers and no deposit held for an individual customer is material.
Therefore the directors do not believe the balance represents a liquidity risk.
The net current liabilities of the Group, excluding deferred income, were 0.1 million at 31 December 2008 2007: 17.8 million.
It is considered appropriate to exclude deferred income in assessing the liquidity of the Group as it reects the future non-refundable contractual revenue of the Group to be recognised as revenue in the following period.
Market risk Interest rate risk In November 2008, the Group repaid the remaining 24 million of debt that remained outstanding on the 50 million facility after the scheduled repayment of 12 million in April 2008.
This debt was held at variable interest rates.
Surplus cash balances are invested to achieve maximum interest returns on a day to day basis.
Whenever possible, and subject to the operational requirements of the Group, cash is repatriated to the head ofce and managed by the Group Treasury department.
Foreign currency risk The Groups exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is minimal as the majority of day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currency.
Working capital balances are generally held in the functional currency of the overseas subsidiary and therefore the impact of the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities in the income statement of overseas subsidiaries is not considered to have a material impact on the Group.
The majority of the Groups net assets are in Pounds Sterling, US dollars and euros.
During the year ended 31 December 2008 the Group did not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments Historically the Group has occasionally used derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate uctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposure to these risks.
At 31 December 2008 there were no derivative financial instruments outstanding 2007: none No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Other market risks The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices.
Capital management The Groups parent company is listed on the UK stock exchange and the Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base.
The Chief Financial officer monitors the diversity of the Groups major shareholders and further details of the Groups communication with key investors can be found in the corporate governance report on pages 26 to 31.
In 2006, the Board approved the commencement of a progressive dividend policy to enhance the total return to shareholders.

Financial instruments and financial risk management continued During the year ended 31 December 2008, the Group completed a reorganisation that introduced a new holding company for the Group.
This was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in the Groups consolidated accounts and as a consequence the shareholders of Regus Group plc became the shareholders of the new holding company, Regus plc.
This reorganisation had no impact on the Groups approach to capital management.
The Groups Chief Executive officer, Mark Dixon, is the major shareholder of the Company and both executive members of the Board hold shares in the Company.
Details of the Directors shareholdings can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 33 to 39.
In addition the Group operates various share option plans for key management and other senior employees.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a resolution for the Group to re-purchase up to 10% of its issued share capital in the market.
In June 2007, the Group commenced a share buyback programme to meet both the need to issue shares under the Groups share option programme and, more generally, as a means of returning cash to shareholders.
In the year ended 31 December 2008, 24,624,000 Regus Group plc and 3,200,000 Regus plc shares were repurchased in the market 2007: 12,853,001 and none were used to satisfy obligations under the share option programme 2007: 905,299.
Neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group continued its share buyback programme during the year ended 31 December 2008.
Regus Group plc declared an interim dividend of 0.6p per share 2007: nil during the year ended 31 December 2008 and Regus plc proposed a final dividend of 1.2p per share 2007: 1.0p per share an 80.0% increase on the 2007 dividend.
There were no other changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
The Groups objective when managing capital equity and borrowings is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Board balances the higher returns possible with higher levels of borrowings with the stability and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Groups return on capital employed for the year ended 31 December 2008, dened as operating profit divided by total shareholders equity, was 30.7% 2007: 39.6%.
During the year the Group repaid the remaining outstanding balance of its principal secured nancing through an early repayment of 24 million.

com Financial Statements Sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2008 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.5 million 2007: 0.4 million with a corresponding increase in total equity.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 3.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: 3.1 million.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: 1.0 million.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the Groups total equity by approximately 12.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: 8.8 million.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against Pounds Sterling would have increased the Groups total equity by approximately 0.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: nil million.

Finance lease liabilities The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash ows at an appropriate discount rate which reects current market assessments and the risks specic to such liabilities.
Loans and overdrafts The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are at oating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Committed borrowing facilities Principal Available m m At 31 December 2008 100.1 50.3 At 31 December 2007 137.2 74.7 Principal committed facilities include 100.0 million 2007: 136.0 million of senior credit facilities, which the Group entered into in 2006, of which 50.3 million 2007: 74.7 million is available.
In order to continue to support these, the Group will deposit sufficient funds with the guaranteeing banks which reduce cash available for use by an equivalent amount.

Share based payment Regus Group Share Option Plan During 2004 the Group established the Regus Group Share Option Plan which entitles executive directors and certain employees to share options in Regus plc.
The table below presents the options outstanding and their exercise price together with an analysis of the movements in the number of options during the year.
The terms of the Regus Share Option Plan France are materially the same as the Regus Group Share Option Plan with the exception that they are only exercisable from the fourth anniversary of the date of grant assuming the performance conditions have been met.
648,081 options awarded under the Regus Group Share Option Plan France are included in the above table and none were exercised during the year 2007: none.
No options were exercised during the year ended 31 December 2008.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2007 was 132.59p.
com Financial Statements Performance conditions for share options The options awarded in 2004 included certain performance criteria that needed to be met in order for the share options to vest.
The share options vested based on the basic earnings per share adjusted for non-recurring items and goodwill and intangible amortisation that exceeded the targets linked to the Retail Price Index.
The basic earnings per share for performance purposes was 1p.
100% of the options awarded in July and September 2004 vested during 2007.
The options awarded in March 2007, April 2007 and March 2008 have the same performance conditions as the CIP Awards granted in the same year as described further below.
The share options awarded in 2004 were valued using the Black Scholes model.

The performance conditions for the LTIP awards made on 3 November 2005 are based on the financial results for the year ended 31 December 2008 and therefore no awards were released during the year ended 31 December 2008. b The CIP awards have release dates of 21 March 2009, 21 March 2010 and 18 March 2011.
The CIP nil cost options have vesting dates of 21 March 2009, 21 March 2010 and 18 March 2011 and expiry dates of 21 March 2016, 21 March 2017 and 18 March 2018.
The performance conditions for the grant of awards under the LTIP and CIP are set out in the following table: For November 2005 and March 2006 awards: Adjusted EPS p for the year ended 31 Dec 2008 11p 12p 13p 14p For September 2006 awards: % increase in adjusted EPS for year ended 30 June 2009 compared to EPS of prior year 15% 20% 25% 30% Growth in free cash flow per share 10% 6% 13% 19% 25% 15% 13% 25% 38% 50% 20% 19% 38% 56% 75% 25% 25% 50% 75% 100% Adjusted EPS.
It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently in determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion.
The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets must have been met on a run rate or underlying basis.
As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated designed to assess the underlying performance of the business.
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees t at the time, by way of example the following adjustments are currently anticipated: In a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive profits in future years.
As such it is important to ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year.
Accordingly those costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth will be excluded from the EPS calculation.
These would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current year losses from investing in new locations.
Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded.
It is expected that in the period between 2006 and 2008 the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised thereby increasing progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target.
This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise deferred tax assets as the business strengthens, reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next.
To provide greater clarity and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%.
The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and free cash ow performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure of the Companys performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long-term shareholder value.
In addition, the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Companys return to shareholders is competitive compared to comparable companies.
com Financial Statements The performance conditions for awards under the matching share element of the CIP made in March 2007 are set out below: % increase in published EPS for the year ended 31 December 2009 compared to the published EPS for the prior year 15% 20% 25% 30% Growth in free cash flow per share over 3 years 10% 6% 13% 19% 25% 15% 13% 25% 38% 50% 20% 19% 38% 56% 75% 25% 25% 50% 75% 100% % denotes the % of the Award which will be released at the end of the performance period.
In addition, no awards will be released unless the Companys TSR is at least at the median when compared against that of the companies comprising the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector at the date of the grant subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Details of the performance conditions for the awards made in March 2008 can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 35 to 36.
As mentioned above, awards under the CIP in respect of the bonus paid for the year ended 31 December 2008 will be made subsequent to the publication of this report.
However, the maximum number of awards granted will be based on the price of an ordinary share at the time of grant and the monetary value will not exceed 50% of basic salary.
Full details of the levels of award and performance conditions will be disclosed in the Committees Remuneration Report for the year ending 31 December 2009.

In the year these acquisitions contributed revenue of 12.4 million and a net retained profit of 1.4 million.
The goodwill arising on the above acquisitions reects the anticipated future benets Regus can obtain from operating the businesses more efficiently, primarily through increasing occupancy and the addition of value adding services.

Key judgmental areas adopted in preparing these accounts The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
Fair value accounting for business combinations Onerous lease provisions For each business combination, we assess the fair values of We have identied certain poor performing centres where the assets and liabilities acquired.
Where there is not an active market lease is considered onerous, i. e. the Group does not expect to in the category of the non-current assets typically acquired with recover the unavoidable lease costs up to the first break point.

We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangibles to assess Consequently, provision has been made only for those potential potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outow will event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to occur and can be reliably estimated.
recover the carrying amount of the asset.
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill at the appropriate cash-generating unit level and make that determination based upon future cash ow projections, which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur.
We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value.
Further details of the methodology and assumptions applied to the impairment review in the year ended 31 December 2008, including the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions, can be found in note 12.
Tax assets and liabilities We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes.
Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time.
Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reected in the accounting estimates.
It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be used.
The Group considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable profit in the previous year and is forecast to continue to make a profit in the foreseeable future.
Where appropriate the Group assesses the potential risk of future tax liabilities arising from the operation of its business in multiple tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within tax liabilities for those risks that can be estimated reliably.
Changes in existing tax laws can affect large international groups similar to Regus and could result in significant additional tax liabilities over and above those already provided for.
