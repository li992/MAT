Underlying EBIT In discussing the operating results of our business, we focus on a non-GAAP IFRS or US financial measure we refer to as Underlying EBIT.
Underlying EBIT is the key measure that management uses internally to assess the performance of our business, make decisions on the allocation of resources and assess operational management.
Management uses this measure because financing structures and tax regimes differ across our assets, and substantial components of our tax and interest charges are levied at a Group, rather than an operational, level.
Underlying EBIT is calculated as earnings before interest and taxation EBIT, which is referred to as profit from operations on the face of the income statement, excluding the effects of exceptional items.
We exclude exceptional items from Underlying EBIT in order to enhance the comparability of the measure from period to period and provide clarity into the underlying performance of our operations.
Our management monitors exceptional items separately.
Underlying EBIT is not a measure that is recognised under IFRS and it may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
The following table reconciles Underlying EBIT to profit from operations for the years ended 30 June 2008, 2007 and 2006.
