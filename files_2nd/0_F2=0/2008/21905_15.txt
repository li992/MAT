Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted is set out below.
a Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and in accordance with guidelines set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP, revised December 2005, for investment trusts, issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, except as disclosed in the following paragraph.
Expenses which are allocated to capital are available to reduce the Companys liability to corporation tax.
The SORP recommends that the benefit of that tax relief should be allocated to capital and a corresponding charge made to revenue.
This is known as the marginal method of allocating tax relief between capital and revenue.
The Company does not adopt the marginal method for two reasons.
Firstly, the Company has only one class of share and any allocation of tax relief between capital and revenue would have no impact on shareholders funds.
Secondly, the significant unutilised management expenses and interest carried forward make it unlikely that the Company will be liable to corporation tax in the foreseeable future.
Had this allocation been made, the charge to revenue and corresponding credit to capital for the year ended 30 September 2008 would have been 1,260,000 2007: 1,012,000. b Investments Investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and are recognised on a purchase date basis.
Listed investments are valued at their fair value which is represented by the bid price.
Changes in fair value are included in the Income Statement as a capital item.
c Capital reserve The following are accounted for in this reserve: realised and unrealised exchange differences on transactions of a capital nature: realised and unrealised exchange differences on forward foreign currency contracts: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: increase and decrease in the valuation of investments held at year end: special dividends of a capital nature: expenses and finance costs charged to capital as set out in the policies below: and cost of purchasing Ordinary Shares for cancellation.
d Income Dividends are recognised as income on the date which the related investments are marked ex-dividend.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no ex-dividend date is quoted are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Income from fixed interest securities is recognised on an effective yield basis.
Other investment income and deposit interest are shown on an accruals basis.
Special dividends of a revenue nature are recognised through the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, an amount equal to the cash dividend is recognised as income.
34 British Assets Trust plc e Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is recognised at the standard rate of corporation tax without discounting.
The Company had no deferred tax liabilities at the year end.
f Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are all allocated to revenue with the exception of management fees which are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital, in accordance with the Boards view on the expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
Performance fees, which derive predominantly by virtue of the Companys capital performance, are charged 100 per cent to capital.
Transaction costs incurred on the purchase and sale of investments are taken to the Income Statement as a capital item.
g Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Finance costs of debt, insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital, in accordance with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
h Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of a transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Capital Reserve or Revenue Reserve depending on the nature of the gain or loss.

FCIB receives a basic quarterly fee, payable in advance, equal to 0.075 per cent of the value of Companys total assets less current liabilities excluding loans.
FCIB also receives a performance-related fee calculated on an annual basis by reference to the performance of the Company against the benchmark index over each 12 month period ended on 30 September.
The performance-related fee is payable in arrears at a rate of up to 0.3 per cent per annum of the value of equity shareholders funds.
The contract between the Company and FCIB may be terminated at any time by either party giving six months notice of termination.
In the event of the Company terminating the contract by giving less than six months notice, FCIB is entitled to compensation calculated as a proportion of the fees payable by the Company in respect of the previous financial year prorated to the date of termination.
Basic investment management fees have been allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital.
Performance fees are charged 100 per cent to capital.
As a result of the European Court of Justice decision that investment management fees payable by investment trusts are not, and should never have been, liable to value added tax VAT, the Company expects to recover VAT of 1.49 million in respect of investment management fees paid to FCIB in the period beginning on 1 January 2001.
The Company expects to make further recoveries in respect of earlier periods see note 19.
The amount recovered has been recognised in the Income Statement and allocated between revenue and capital in the same ratio as the VAT originally suffered.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised on this amount as it is unlikely that there will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the deferred tax asset could be deducted.

The Company replaced the Bonds with a five year 60 million multi-currency revolving advance facility.
As at 30 September 2008, 30.1 million, in various currencies, was drawn down at an average interest rate of 4.88 per cent.
The interest rate on amounts utilised is variable at 0.50 per cent per annum above LIBOR for the relevant currency.
An arrangement fee of 60,000 was paid and non-utilisation fees of 0.25 per cent per annum are payable.
Under the covenants relating to the multi-currency revolving advance facility the Company is to ensure that at all times its total borrowings including the Bonds do not exceed 50 per cent of the net asset value.

The Bonds are secured by floating charges over all the assets of the Company.
Under the covenants relating to the Bonds, the Company is to ensure that, at all times, the aggregate principal amount outstanding in respect of moneys borrowed by the Company does not exceed an amount equal to its share capital and reserves.

Capital reserve Items accounted for this reserve are detailed in accounting policy 1 c. Revenue reserve The net profit arising in the revenue column of the Income Statement is added to this reserve.
Dividends paid during the year are deducted from the reserve, and it is available for paying future dividends on the Companys shares.
Capital management The Companys capital is represented by the issued share capital, Capital Redemption Reserve, Capital Reserve and Revenue Reserve.
The capital of the Company is managed in accordance with its investment policy, in pursuit of its investment objective, both of which are detailed in the Report of the Directors.
15 Net asset value per share The net asset value per share and the net asset value attributable to the Ordinary Shares at the year end were as follows: Net asset value per share Net asset value 2008 2007 2008 2007 pence pence 000 000 Ordinary Shares 114.0 161.4 333,516 485,772 Net asset value per Ordinary Share is calculated on shareholders funds of 333,516,000 2007: 485,772,000 divided by the number of Ordinary Shares in issue at the year end of 292,612,282 2007: 301,012,282.

As an investment trust the Company holds a portfolio of financial assets in pursuit of its investment objective.
The Company makes use of borrowings, as detailed in notes 11 and 12 and the Chairmans Statement, to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The downside risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances held.
Listed fixed asset investments held see note 9 are valued at fair value.
For listed securities this is either bid price or the last traded price depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is listed.
The market value of the Companys Bonds is disclosed in note 12.
The fair value of all other financial assets and liabilities is represented by their carrying value in the Balance Sheet shown on page 32.
The fair value of the loans is not materially different from the carrying value in the Balance Sheet.
The main risks that the Company faces arising from its financial instruments are: i market price risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency rate movements: ii interest rate risk, being the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates: iii foreign currency risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings, investment purchases, investment sales and income will fluctuate because of movements in currency rates: iv credit risk, being the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company: and v liquidity risk, being the risk that the Company may not be able to liquidate its investments quickly enough to meet its ongoing financial commitments.
42 British Assets Trust plc 18 Financial instruments continued The Company held the following categories of financial instruments as at 30 September 2008: 2008 2007 000 000 Financial assets Investment portfolio 401,838 558,724 Cash at bank and on deposit 17,962 47,349 Amounts due from brokers 600 3,378 Accrued income 2,173 2,559 Other debtors 1,490 Financial liabilities 6.25 per cent Bonds 2031 59,395 59,368 6.625 per cent Bonds 2008 59,968 Revolving advance facility 30,066 Amounts due to brokers 210 6,089 Bond interest payable 207 207 Other creditors 669 606 Market price risk The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is typical of equity investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out on pages 16 and 17.
Derivatives may be used from time to time to hedge specific market risk or gain exposure to a specific market.
As at the year end the Company held no exposure to derivatives other than hedged currency exposure as disclosed on page 47.
If the investment portfolio valuation fell by 20 per cent at 30 September 2008, the impact on the profit or loss and the net asset value would have been negative 80.4 million 2007: negative 111.7 million.
If the investment portfolio valuation rose by 20 per cent at 30 September 2008, the impact on the profit or loss and the net asset value would have been positive 80.4 million 2007: positive 111.7 million.
The calculations are based on the portfolio valuation as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 43 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk Floating rate When the Company retains cash balances the majority of the cash is held in deposit accounts.
The benchmark rate which determines the interest payments received on cash balances is the bank base rate for the relevant currency for each deposit.
2008 2007 2008 Average 2007 Average Average period Average period 2008 interest until 2007 interest until 000 rate maturity 000 rate maturity Multi-currency revolving advance facility 30,066 4.88% 4.50 years The revolving advance facility is a multi-currency facility.
As at 30 September 2008 this consisted of 19.0 million, US$12.6 million 7.1 million sterling equivalent, Euro 3.1 million 2.4 million sterling equivalent and Yen 293,595 million 1.6 million sterling equivalent.
The interest rate on amounts utilised is variable at 0.5 per cent per annum above LIBOR for the relevant currency.
If the bank base rate had increased by 1.0 per cent, the impact on the profit or loss would have been a negative 121,000 2007: positive 473,000 due to high cash balances.
If the bank base rate had decreased by 1.0 per cent, the impact on the profit or loss would have been a positive 121,000 2007: negative 473,000 due to high cash balances.
The calculations are based on the cash balances and the revolving advance facility as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Fixed rate The Company holds fixed interest investments and has fixed interest liabilities.
2008 2007 2008 Average 2007 Average Average period Average period 2008 interest until 2007 interest until 000 rate maturity 000 rate maturity Fixed interest investments 29,539 10.25% 8.01 years 32,061 6.87% 9.01 years Fixed interest liabilities: 6.625 per cent Bonds 2008 59,968 6.625% 0.50 years 6.25 per cent Bonds 2031 59,395 6.25% 22.95 years 59,368 6.25% 23.95 years The Bonds are denominated in sterling.
As they are fixed rate bonds, the Company is exposed to changes in market value in the event that the Bonds are repaid before maturity.
This exposure may be reduced by investing in fixed interest securities.
The fair value of the Bonds, based on middle market prices, at 30 September 2008 was 63.1 million 2007: 126.3 million.
Non-interest bearing investments The Companys non-interest bearing investments are its equity investments which had a value of 372,299,000 as at 30 September 2008 2007: 526,663,000.
44 British Assets Trust plc 18 Financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represents the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
At the reporting date, the Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following: 2008 2007 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 17,962 47,349 Balances due from brokers 600 3,378 Interest, dividends and other receivables 3,663 2,559 22,225 53,286 Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small due to the short settlement period involved and the diversity of counterparties used.
All the assets of the Company which are traded on a recognised exchange are held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed or limited.
The Board monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports as described in the Report of the Directors on page 26.
The Managers have in place a monitoring procedure in respect of counterparty risk which is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is controlled because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings, rated AA or higher, assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of such financial institutions may cause the Companys ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed, limited or lost.
As at 30 September 2008 the Company had an overnight deposit of 13.5 million with a single counterparty.
There were no other material concentrations of credit risk to counterparties at 30 September 2008 or 30 September 2007 because other deposits were spread over a number of counterparties.
Liquidity risk The Companys listed securities are considered to be readily realisable in normal market conditions.
The Companys liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Managers.

Short term flexibility is achieved, where necessary, through the use of overdraft facilities.

19 Contingent asset The Association of Investment Companies and JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust plc lodged a joint appeal in 2004 for the payment of management fees by investment trusts to be treated as exempt from VAT.
In June 2007 the European Court of Justice ECJ found in favour of the appellants, declaring that investment trusts should be treated as special investment funds and thus exempted from VAT on management fees.
HM Revenue & Customs HMRC announced that it would not appeal against the ECJ decision.
The Managers have submitted protective claims to HMRC in respect of all prior periods which might fall within the scope of the ECJ ruling and in which VAT was paid by the Company to the Managers.
The Managers have reached agreement with HMRC to recover 1.49 million in relation to the period from 1 January 2001 and this amount is included in the accounts see note 3.
The Company expects to recover further VAT on management fees in the range of 850,000 to 900,000 paid to the Managers in relation to earlier periods.
However, at this point in time the amounts involved are uncertain and have therefore not been recognised in the accounts.
