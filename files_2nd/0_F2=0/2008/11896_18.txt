PayPoint plc NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Accounting policies These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis and on the policies set out below.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
This has resulted in the financial instrument disclosures previously required by IAS32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and Disclosure being replaced by those under IFRS 7.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IAS1 Revised Presentation of financial statements IAS23 Revised Borrowing costs IAS27 Revised Consolidated and separate financial statements Amendment to IAS32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Amendment to IFRS2 Share based payment IFRS3 Revised Business combinations IFRS8 Operating Segments IFRIC11 IFRS2: Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes IFRIC 14 IAS19: The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction.
The group does not consider that these Standards and Interpretations will have a significant impact on the financial statements of the group when the respective standards come into effect.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the group operates.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation PayPoint plc the company acts as a holding company.
The group accounts consolidate the accounts of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries drawn up to March each year.
Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity in which it invests, so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
Investments are stated at cost less any required provision for impairment.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets 40 that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
At each balance sheet date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a re-valued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a re-valued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and comprises the value of sales of services excluding VAT in the normal course of business.
Revenue and cost of sales are recorded according to the actual transactions that occur in a given period.
In Ireland and Romania, PayPoint is principal in the supply chain for prepaid mobile telephone top-ups mobile top-ups.
Accordingly, revenue includes the sale price of the mobile top-ups and the cost of sales includes the cost of the 41 PayPoint plc mobile top-ups to PayPoint.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Cost of sales Cost of sales includes agents commission, the cost of mobile top-ups where PayPoint acts as principal in their purchase and sale, consumables, communications, maintenance, depreciation and field service costs and in respect of Metacharge, external processing charges levied by acquiring banks.
All other costs are allocated to administrative costs.
Pension costs The group makes payments to a number of defined contribution pension schemes.
The amounts charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs represent contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based upon the managements estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of either a Monte Carlo simulation or Black Scholes model depending upon the scheme.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The provision is calculated using tax rates that have been substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the tax will be realised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is 42 charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the year, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the year of disposal of the operation.
Intangible assets Contracts with merchants and technology On acquisitions the group has recognised contracts with merchants and technology, based on their estimated fair values as intangible assets.
Contracts with merchants are amortised on a straight line basis generally between 1 and 5 years and technology is amortised over its estimated useful economic life of 10 years.
Software development expenditure The group develops computer software for internal use.
Software development expenditure on large projects is recognised as an intangible asset if it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits.
The costs that are capitalised are the directly attributable costs necessary to create and prepare the asset for operations.
Other software costs are recognised in administrative expenses when incurred.
Software development costs recognised as an intangible asset are amortised on a straight line basis over the useful life, generally not more than three years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation less provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:  leasehold improvements over the life of the lease:  terminals 5 years:  automatic teller machines 4 years: and  other classes of assets 3 years.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised as income.
43 PayPoint plc Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Leases Assets held under finance leases, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, are capitalised as property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the remaining balance of liability.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are similarly spread on a straight line basis over the lease term, except where the period to the review date on which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate is shorter than the full lease term, in which case the shorter period is used.
Rentals received for ATMs from retail agents under operating leases are credited to income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Dividends Final dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are approved by the companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when declared.
Treasury shares PayPoint purchases own shares for the purpose of employee share option schemes.
Such shares are deducted from equity and no profit or loss is recognised on the transactions.
Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits maturing within 3 months and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Critical accounting judgements The critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty in the business are valuation of goodwill 27.5 million 2007: 18.2 million and other intangible assets 2.7 million 2007: 2.8 million.
Management reviews goodwill for any impairment on an annual basis, see note 10.
Intangible assets are amortised over their economic useful life, see note 11.
The accounting policies for goodwill and intangible assets are included above in this note 1.
Segmental reporting, net revenue analysis, cost of sales and gross throughput i Segmental information a Geographical segments The group operates in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Romania but the group has only one reportable geographical segment as defined in International Accounting Standard 14 Segment Reporting due to the fact that principally all operations occur in the UK.
b Classes of business The group has one class of business, being payment collection and distribution services.
44 ii Analysis of net revenues by sector, cost of sales and gross throughput Revenue comprises the value of sales excluding VAT of services in the normal course of business and includes amounts billed to customers to be passed on to retail agents as commission payable, the face value of mobile top-ups where PayPoint acts as principal and for Metacharge, it includes acquiring bank charges which are amounts billed to merchants that are passed onto the sponsoring bank.
Cost of sales includes the cost to the group of the sale, including commission to retail agents and the cost of mobile top-ups where PayPoint is the principal in the supply chain.
Revenue performance of the business is measured by net revenue which is calculated as the total revenue from clients less commission payable to retail agents and the cost of mobile top-ups where PayPoint is the principal in the supply chain.
Although there is only one class of business, since the risks and returns are similar across markets in which the group operates, the group monitors net revenue see below with reference to each sector.
Gross throughput represents payments made by consumers using the PayPoint service, for bill and general payments, mobile top-ups, cash withdrawals from ATMs and the value of transactions via the internet.

The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next four years and extends cash flows for the following eight years based on estimated growth rates.
Terminal values are based on growth rates that do not exceed three per cent.
The post tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10 per cent.

An exchange difference arises as a result of the intangible assets for Pay Store.
IAS 21 requires the use of the acquisition rate for the original purchase cost and the year end rate for the end of the year balance, thus giving an exchange difference.
The cost for ATMs that are rented out under operating leases is 5,455,000 2007: 4,857,000 and the accumulated depreciation 3,548,000 2007: 2,326,000.
At 30 March 2008 the group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of terminals and ATMs amounting to 678,000 2007: 751,000.

No deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of these losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
All losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
ii there were timing differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the group is in a position to control their reversal and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Pay Store contributed 30.8 million revenue and 1.0 million loss including amortisation of intangible assets of 0.3 million to the groups profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of Pay Store had been completed on the first day of the financial year, the groups results would have been revenue of 216 million and 21 million profit attributable to equity holders of the parent.
The group has provided fully for all receivables over 180 days.

The average term of each lease entered into is 5 years.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The groups financial instruments comprise cash and various items such as trade receivables, trade payables, other payables and accruals, which arise directly from the groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged during the year.
The group has not used derivative instruments to manage its foreign exchange exposure.
a Interest rate risk The group has been funded by equity, interests in short-term deposits and finance leases over the period currently under review.
The group has interest bearing no financial assets at 30 March 2008 other than Sterling and Euro deposits of 27,727,000 2007: 24,324,000.
Of these deposits, 8,001,000 2007: 7,290,000 relates to monies held on behalf of clients where PayPoint has title to the funds for periods of up to 7 days.
All sterling funds earn interest at the prevailing rate.
Some money is deposited on short-term deposits normally weekly or monthly.
The group seeks to maximise interest receipts within these parameters.
Finance leases have been used to finance certain asset purchases within the group.
Interest is charged on these leases at fixed contractual rates.
Further analysis of the interest rate profile of the fixed rate financial liabilities as at 30 March 2008 and 25 March 2007 is provided below: Weighted average interest rate on fixed rate financial liabilities: 2 2008 008 2007 % % % Finance leases 4 4 12 Weighted average period for which interest rate is fixed: 2 2008 008 2007 mo months nths months Finance leases 14 14 2 63 PayPoint plc b Liquidity risk The groups policy throughout the year ended 30 March 2008 regarding liquidity has been to maximise the return on funds placed on deposit within the constraint of minimising the associated risk.
The group had no financial liabilities at 30 March 2008 other than short-term payables, such as trade payables, accruals and amounts due in more than one year comprising of finance leases.
c Foreign exchange risk To date, the group has not engaged in an active programme of foreign exchange risk management.
Given the size and nature of the groups non-sterling denominated balances, the directors do not consider a hedging strategy to be necessary.
The groups currency exposures comprise those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
d Borrowing facilities The group has a 15 million loan facility with Lloyds TSB on a revolving loan facility with a remaining term of three years.
e Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The directors consider there to be no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the groups financial instruments at 30 March 2008 and 25 March 2007. f Market price risk The groups exposure to market price risk comprises interest rate exposure.
Group funds are invested in money market cash deposits with the objective of maintaining a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice, this has meant that no deposits were made with a maturity greater than 30 days during the year.
g Capital risk management The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
h Credit risk The groups principal financial assets are cash, trade and other receivables and investments.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
Cients, agents and merchants are credit checked to mitigate credit risk and in all new client contracts we have the right of set-off of funds collected against monies due.
The groups maximum exposure, at 30 March 2008, was 55,644,000 2007: 43,884,000. i Financial instrument sensitivities Financial instruments affected by market risk include deposits, trade receivables and trade payables, any changes in market variables exchange rates and interest rates will have an immaterial effect on these instruments.

Those directors who are shareholders will be voting in favour of the resolutions and unanimously recommend that you do so as well.
70 Explanatory notes to certain of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting Resolution 10: Directors authority to allot shares By virtue of section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 the Act, the directors require the authority of shareholders of the company to allot shares or other relevant securities.
The resolution numbered 10 authorises the directors to make allotments of up to an additional 22,566,799 ordinary shares representing approximately one-third of the issued share capital of the company as at the date of this document.
This amount is in line with ABI guidelines.
If approved at the forthcoming annual general meeting, the authority will expire no later than 15 months from the date on which the resolution is passed or on the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the company to be held in 2009, whichever is the sooner.
The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority proposed to be conferred pursuant to resolution 10.
Resolution 11: Authority for disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights By virtue of section 89 of the Act, any issue by the company of equity capital for cash made otherwise than to existing shareholders on a proportional basis requires the consent of shareholders of the company unless the company has obtained their authority under section 95 of the Act.
The resolution numbered 11 is for that purpose.
It authorises the directors to allot shares by way of rights issue or pursuant to an open offer or otherwise than strictly pro rata when the directors consider that it is expedient to do so and also allows them to issue for cash up to 3,385,020 ordinary shares representing approximately 5 per cent.
of the issued share capital of the company as at the date of this document other than on a pre-emptive basis.
Resolution 12: Authority to make market purchases of ordinary shares By virtue of section 166 of the Act, the company may make market purchases of its own ordinary shares if authorised to do so by shareholders.
Under resolution 12, the directors seek to renew an annual authority to make market purchases of shares: each year the directors will seek to further renew this authority at the companys annual general meeting.
Any ordinary shares purchased under this authority would either be i cancelled immediately on completion of the purchase and the number of ordinary shares in issue reduced accordingly: ii held, sold, transferred or otherwise dealt with as treasury shares in accordance with the provisions of the Act: or iii transferred to an employee benefit trust for the satisfaction of awards under the companys existing share schemes.
The maximum number of ordinary shares which could be purchased pursuant to this authority is 10,148,281, being 14.99 per cent.
of the issued share capital of the company as at the date of this document.
Any repurchase of ordinary shares carried out by the company would be at a maximum price per ordinary share of 105 per cent.
of the average middle market price of such a share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase, the price equal to the last independent trade or the highest current independent bid and at a minimum price equal to the nominal value.
The authority to repurchase ordinary shares will, if approved by shareholders, only be exercised after careful consideration by the directors and if such exercise would result in an increase in earnings per share and be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
If approved at the forthcoming annual general meeting, the authority will expire no later than 15 months from the date on which the resolution is passed, or on the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the company to be held in 2009, whichever is the sooner.
71 PayPoint plc Resolution 13: New articles of association We are also asking shareholders to approve a number of amendments to the articles of association of the company, primarily to reflect the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Whilst we are asking for your approval to amend the articles at the 2008 annual general meeting, a number of the provisions contained in the new Act are not scheduled to come into effect until October 2009 and it may therefore be necessary to make further subsequent changes to the articles.
So far as the 2008 annual general meeting is concerned, an explanation of the main changes between the proposed and the existing articles of association is set out the Appendix on pages 73 to 75 of this document.
72 APPENDIX EXPLANATORY NOTES OF PRINCIPAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION The companys existing articles of association the Existing Articles were adopted in September 2004 and during the last year, a number of sections of the Companies Act 2006 the 2006 Act which affect the constitutional documents of UK listed public companies have been brought into force.
In addition to those modifications stipulated by the 2006 Act, it is proposed that certain other amendments to the Existing Articles be adopted to reflect previous changes in legislation or to ensure consistency with the 2006 Act.
Given the number of amendments to be made in this regard, the directors consider it prudent to seek shareholder approval to the adoption of new articles of association the New Articles to reflect certain of those changes.
Set out below is a summary of the main differences between the Existing and the New Articles.
This summary has been prepared in order to assist shareholders in understanding the rationale for and substance of the proposed amendments.
Other changes, which are of a minor, technical or clarifying nature and also some more minor changes which merely reflect changes made by the 2006 Act have not been noted in the Appendix.
Although the New Articles are in many respects largely unchanged from the Existing Articles, the directors are proposing that, for ease of reference, shareholders pass a resolution to adopt the New Articles rather than to pass resolutions detailing each individual amendment.
The New Articles showing all the changes made to the Existing Articles are available for inspection, as noted on page 70 of this document.
Provisions which duplicate statutory provisions Provisions in the Existing Articles which replicate provisions contained in the 2006 Act are in the main to be removed in the New Articles.
This is in line with the approach advocated by the Government that statutory provisions should not be duplicated in a companys constitution.
Examples of such provisions are those relating to the form of resolutions, the variation of class rights and the requirement to keep accounting records.
The main changes made to reflect this approach are detailed below.
Form of resolution The Existing Articles contain a provision that, where for any purpose an ordinary resolution is required, a special or extraordinary resolution is also effective and that, where an extraordinary resolution is required, a special resolution is also effective.
This provision is being removed as the concept of extraordinary resolutions has not been retained under the 2006 Act.
The Existing Articles enable members to act by written resolution.
Under the 2006 Act, public companies can no longer pass members written resolutions.
These provisions have therefore been removed in the New Articles.
Variation of class rights The Existing Articles contain provisions regarding the variation of class rights.
The proceedings and specific quorum requirements for a meeting convened to vary class rights are contained in the 2006 Act.
The relevant provisions have therefore been removed in the New Articles.
Convening extraordinary and annual general meetings The provisions in the Existing Articles dealing with the convening of general meetings and the length of notice required to convene general meetings are being amended to conform to new provisions in the 2006 Act.
In particular, an extraordinary general meeting now called a general meeting to consider a special resolution can be convened on 14 days notice whereas previously 21 days notice was required.
Votes of members Under the 2006 Act, proxies are entitled to vote on a show of hands whereas under the Existing Articles, proxies are only entitled to vote on a poll.
The time limits for the appointment or termination of a proxy appointment have been altered by the 2006 Act so that a companys articles cannot provide that they should be received more than 48 hours before the meeting or in the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after the meeting, more than 24 hours before the time for the taking of a poll, with weekends and bank holidays being permitted to be excluded for this purpose.
Multiple proxies may be appointed provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share held by the shareholder.
Multiple corporate representatives may be appointed but if they purport to exercise their rights in different ways, then the power is treated as not being exercised.
The New Articles reflect all of these new provisions.
Age of directors on appointment The Existing Articles contain a provision requiring a directors age to be disclosed if he has attained the age of 70 years or more in the notice convening a meeting at which the director is proposed to be elected.
Such a provision could now fall foul of the Employment Equality Age Regulations 2006 and so has been removed from the New Articles.
Conflicts of interest The 2006 Act sets out directors general duties which largely codify the existing law but with certain changes.
A director is now required to avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of any company of which he is a director.
The requirement is very broad and could apply, for example, if a director becomes a director of another company or a trustee of another organisation.
The 2006 Act allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate, where the articles of association contain a provision to this effect.
The 2006 Act also allows articles of association to contain other provisions for dealing with directors conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty.
The New Articles give the directors authority to approve such situations and to include other provisions to allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with in a similar way to the current position.
There are safeguards which will apply when directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict.
First, only directors who have no interest in the matter being considered will be able to take the relevant decision and secondly, in taking the decision, the directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the companys success.
The directors will be able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
It is also proposed that the New Articles should contain provisions relating to confidential information, attendance at board meetings and availability of board papers to protect a director being in breach of duty if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest arises.
These provisions will only apply where the 74 position giving rise to the potential conflict has previously been authorised by the directors.
It is the Boards intention to report annually on the companys procedures for ensuring that the Boards powers to authorise conflicts are operated effectively.
Notice of board meetings Under the Existing Articles, when a director is abroad he can request that notice of directors meetings are sent to him at a specified address and if he does not do so he is not entitled to receive notice while he is away.
This provision has been removed, as modern communications mean that there may be no particular obstacle to giving notice to a director who is abroad.
It has been replaced with a more general provision that a director is treated as having waived his entitlement to notice unless he supplies the company with the information necessary to ensure that he receives notice of a meeting before it takes place.
Records to be kept The provision in the Existing Articles requiring the Board to keep accounting records has been removed as this requirement is contained in the 2006 Act.
Distribution of assets other than in cash The Existing Articles contain provisions dealing with the distribution of assets in kind in the event of the company going into liquidation.
These provisions have been removed in the New Articles on the grounds that a provision concerning the powers of liquidators is a matter for insolvency law rather than the articles and because the Insolvency Act 1986 confers powers on the liquidator which would enable it in any event to do what is envisaged by the Existing Articles.
Electronic and web communications Provisions of the 2006 Act which came into force in January 2007 enable companies to communicate with members by electronic and or website communications.
The New Articles continue to allow communications to members in electronic form and, in addition, they also permit the company to take advantage of new provisions relating to website communications first introduced by resolution passed at the companys 2007 annual general meeting.
Before the company can communicate with a member by means of website communication, the relevant member must be asked individually by the company to agree that it may send or supply documents or information to him by means of a website and the company must either have received a positive response or have received no response within the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which the request was sent.
The company will notify the member either in writing or by other permitted means when a relevant document or information is placed on the website and a member can always request a hard copy version of the document or information.
Directors indemnities and loans to fund expenditure The 2006 Act has in some areas widened the scope of the powers of a company to indemnify directors and to fund expenditure incurred in connection with certain actions taken against them.
In particular, a company that is a trustee of an occupational pension scheme can now indemnify a director against liability incurred in connection with the companys activities as trustee of the scheme.
In addition, the existing exemption allowing a company to provide money for the purpose of funding a directors defence in court proceedings now expressly covers regulatory proceedings and applies to associated companies.
