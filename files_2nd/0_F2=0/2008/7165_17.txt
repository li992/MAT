Exceptional items During the year the Group amended the terms of its dened benefit pension scheme.
This amendment restricts the annual increase in pensionable pay qualifying earnings to the lower of ination or 5%.
The effect of this change is a curtailment benefit which has been recognised in the Income Statement as an exceptional credit of 22.0 million.
Also during the year, the Group has initiated a Group-wide project to transform its IT infrastructure, software and business operations.
This has led the Directors to conclude that the carrying value of certain intangible and tangible assets that were previously used in its operations are impaired and they have been written down by 6.7 million.
The exceptional credit generated a tax charge of 4.3 million.
There was no cash impact from the exceptional items.

The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined based on the higher of value in use calculations and its fair value less costs to sell.
The value in use calculations use cash ow projections based on internal business plans approved by the Directors.
Following the impairment tests, no impairment of goodwill was required in the year or the preceding year.
In the prior year, the amount written back of 7.9 million represents the reversal of deferred contingent consideration for acquisitions which was determined to be no longer required.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: In s million 2008 2007 United Kingdom & Ireland 92.4 92.5 Continental Europe & Rest of World 58.2 49.6 Asia Pacific 18.3 15.6 168.9 157.7 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on management forecasts.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash ows for the following years based on an average estimated growth rate of 3.0%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash ows is 9.5% post tax.

Retirement benefit obligations Within the UK, the Group operates one dened contribution scheme and two dened benefit schemes.
The majority of overseas arrangements are either dened contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
UK Dened Contribution Scheme The Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan was established on 1 July 2001.
Money purchase benets are funded by contributions from employees and, for eligible employees, from the employer.
Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 15% of pensionable salary depending on the length of pensionable service and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Income Statement of 1.1 million 2007 0.8 million represents contributions payable to the Stakeholder Plan.
Contributions of nil 2007 nil were outstanding at the end of the year.
The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
UK Dened benefit Schemes i The main scheme, the Hays Pension Scheme, is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
It is a funded approved dened benefit scheme and closed to new members on 1 July 2001.
It is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
ii The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who were subject to HMRCs earnings cap on pensionable salary.
The last formal actuarial valuations were performed at 30 June 2006.
A roll forward of the actuarial valuations of the Hays Pension Scheme and the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme to 30 June 2008 has been performed by the Scheme actuary, an employee of Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
The key assumptions used at 30 June 2008 are listed on the following page.
Retirement benefit obligations continued IAS 19 accounting valuation Hays plc has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows: scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date: scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the Income Statement, in retained earnings and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The key assumptions are as follows: 2008 2007 Ination assumption 3.70% 3.30% Discount rate 5.75% 5.57% Rate of increase in salaries 3.95% 5.80% Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 3.70% 3.30% Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets 6.43% 6.87% The assumption for the expected long-term returns for scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return for each asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year.
The long-term expected rate of return on scheme assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net finance income charge.
The mortality rates have been calculated using the PA92 generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection.
This assumes that a 65 year old, male, current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.9 years.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the dened benefit schemes are as follows: In s million 2008 2007 Current service cost 5.7 7.1 Past service costs curtailments 22.0 Total operating charge 16.3 7.1 Expected return on pension scheme assets 28.3 24.4 Interest on pension liabilities 25.3 22.5 Net financial income 3.0 1.9 Total amount credited charged to the Consolidated Income Statement 19.3 5.2 The actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense as follows: In s million 2008 2007 Actuarial loss gain on scheme assets 51.0 16.0 Actuarial losses on scheme liabilities 6.1 4.7 Impact of changes in assumptions relating to the present value of scheme liabilities 14.1 1.6 Net expense income recognised directly in Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense 71.2 12.9 Hays plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 77 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 20.

The expected rates of return for corporate bonds have been based on market yields at the balance sheet date, with equity returns assumed to be 3.0% per annum above gilt returns.
During the year, the Trustees decided to increase the proportion of assets invested in bonds by circa 10%.
The increased weighting in bonds was achieved by a corresponding reduced weighting in equities.
The history of experience adjustments is as follows: In s million 2008 2007 2006 Present value of dened benefit obligations 474.8 455.6 431.7 Fair value of scheme assets 386.7 412.1 375.8 Deficit in the scheme 88.1 43.5 55.9 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities Amount s million 6.1 4.7 4.7 Percentage of scheme liabilities % 1% 1% 1% Experience adjustments on scheme assets Amount s million 51.0 16.0 19.1 Percentage of scheme assets % 13% 4% 5% The estimated amount of contributions expected to be paid to the scheme during the current financial year is 7 million.

The leases expire in periods up to 2013.
It is not possible to estimate the timing of payments against the other deferred employee benefit provisions.
Other provisions comprise liabilities arising as a result of the business disposals and the Group transformation that concluded in 2004, including the following items: provisions of 1.6 million 2007 3.7 million relating to restructuring costs arising from the Group transformation.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next 24 months: provisions of 18.8 million 2007 18.9 million relating to possible warranty and environmental claims in relation to businesses disposed of.
It is not possible to estimate the timing of payments against these provisions: after a detailed review of Other provisions, the Directors have concluded that 5.0 million of Other provisions is more fairly presented in the Property provisions.

The impact of the rate change is reected in the current year movement.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 50.9 million 2007 21.3 million available for offset against future profits of which 10.0 million relates to United Kingdom capital losses and 40.9 million to overseas losses.
No material deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of such losses 2007 nil.
These are unrecognised tax losses that are unlikely to expire in the short-term.
0.1 million is due to expire in 2012.
The Group has unused tax credits of 2.1 million 2007 0.6 million available against future profits: these credits are unlikely to expire in the short-term.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these credits 2007 nil.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries on which deferred tax liabilities have not been provided is 120.5 million.
The reason for not providing is because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.
Additionally it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future and the level of underlying tax credit on remitted earnings is likely to cover any UK corporation tax.

Share-based payments continued Long Term Co-Incentive Plan LTCIP In previous years, employees were invited to commit a number of shares to the LTCIP.
The LTCIP is based upon the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the Company over a three year period, compared to a peer group of 15 other companies including Hays plc.
Dependent upon the performance ranking, the Company will match up to five times the number of shares committed by the employee.
If the ranking of Hays plc is ninth or less then there is no matching of shares by the Company.
During the year, there were no invitations 2007 nil invitations to the LTCIP.
The fair value of invitations is calculated at the final date of commitment and is charged to the Income Statement over the vesting period of three years.
The 2004 LTCIP award vested on 21 December 2007 and participants became entitled to 33% of the matching shares based on the Companys TSR performance over the three year period to 21 December 2007, where Hays was ranked in 8th position out of the peer group of 15 companies.
A total of 0.4 million shares were matched for this award.
Performance Share Plan PSP and Deferred Annual Bonus DAB These are the incentive arrangements that replaced the LTCIP last year.
Only members of the Management Board participate in the DAB and circa 320 managers participate in the PSP.
The PSP and DAB are equity settled share-based payment awards with non-market performance conditions over a three year period.
Under the DAB, up to 100% of the annual bonus is deferred into Hays shares and is matched with free conditional shares or nil cost options at a maximum one for one basis, subject to the performance conditions over a three year period.
Under the PSP, generally the awards are a maximum of 30% to 150% of a participants base salary and will not exceed two times a participants base salary in any financial year.
The first PSP award, PSP 1, made in April 2007, and the first DAB award, DAB 1, made in May 2007, has a performance period of three years from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2009.
The 2007 awards are two years through the three year performance period.
The second awards, PSP 2 and DAB 2, were made in September 2007 for a three year performance period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2010.
The 2008 awards are one year through the three year performance period.
The performance criteria for the DAB awards are a combination of cumulative Group EPS and cumulative International Net Fees.
