22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price movements that arise in the normal course of the groups business.
The groups treasury objectives, risk management strategies and policies are disclosed in the Business review see Risk management.
i Currency risk The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements, which will affect the groups transaction costs and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign operations by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps and forwards.
In February 2008, the board reviewed and approved the following revised foreign exchange risk management policy to effectively manage planning and rebalancing processes.
Where a liquid foreign exchange market exists, the groups policy is to seek to hedge currency exposure on its net investment in foreign operations within the following percentage bands: 80% to 100% for US dollars, 80% to 100% for euros and 50% to 100% for other significant currencies.
The groups previous policy was, where a liquid foreign exchange market exists, to seek to hedge currency exposure on its foreign equity investments before net borrowings at approximately the following percentages: 90% for US dollars, 90% for euros and 50% for other significant currencies.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings including foreign currency swaps and forwards, to the extent that they are in an effective hedge relationship, are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to match exchange differences on foreign equity investments.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not in a hedge relationship and any ineffectiveness are taken to the income statement.
