Financial assets and liabilities The Groups financial instruments can be analysed as follows: 31 December 31 December 2008 2007 000 000 Financial assets: Investments held at fair value 310,831 335,608 Held to maturity deposits with credit institutions 100,032 - Receivables amounts owed by policyholders 176,072 146,240 Total financial assets per consolidated balance sheet 586,935 481,848 Trade and other receivables 25,501 22,633 Cash and cash equivalents 144,286 155,773 756,722 660,254 Financial liabilities: Trade and other payables 270,088 239,593 All receivables from policyholders are due within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
All investments held at fair value are invested in AAA-rated money market liquidity funds.
These funds spread across three very large providers target a 7 day LIBID return with capital security and low volatility and continue to achieve these goals.
The amortised cost carrying amount of held to maturity deposits and receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Objectives, policies and procedures for managing financial assets and liabilities The Groups activities expose it primarily to the significant financial risks of credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.
The Board of Directors has delegated the task of supervising risk management and internal control to the Risk Management Committee RMC.
There is also an Investment Committee that makes recommendations to the Board on the Groups investment strategy.
There are several key elements to the risk management environment throughout the Group.
These are detailed in full in the Corporate Governance statement.
Specific considerations for the risks arising from financial assets and liabilities are detailed below.
Interest rate risk The Group considers interest rate risk to be the risk that unfavourable movements in interest rates could adversely impact on the capital values of financial assets and liabilities.
This relates primarily to investments held at fair value.
The Group has a policy of primarily investing in AAA-rated money market liquidity funds, which in turn invest in a mixture of very short dated fixed and variable rate securities, such as cash deposits, certificates of deposits, floating rate notes and other commercial paper.
The funds are not permitted to have an average maturity greater than 60 days and hence are not subject to large movements in yield and value resulting from changes in market interest rates as longer duration fixed income portfolios experience.
Returns are likely to closely track the 7 day LIBID benchmark and hence while the Groups investment return will vary according to market interest rates, the capital value of these investment funds will not be impacted by rate movements.
The interest rate risk arising is therefore considered to be minimal.
8 f I n A n c I A L s tAt E M E n t s The Group also holds a number of fixed rate, longer-term deposits with UK credit institutions rated A or above.
These are classified as held to maturity and valued at amortised cost.
Therefore neither the capital value of the deposits, or the interest return will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
No sensitivity analysis to interest rates has been presented on materiality grounds.
Credit risk The Group defines credit risk as the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations or fails to perform them in a timely fashion.
The key areas of exposure to credit risk for the Group result through its reinsurance programme, investments and bank deposits and to a lesser extent, policyholder receivables.
Economic and financial market conditions have led the Directors to consider counterparty exposure more frequently and in significant detail.
The Directors consider that the policies and procedures in place to manage credit exposure continue to be appropriate for the Groups risk appetite, and no material credit losses have been experienced by the Group.
There are no specific concentrations of credit risk with respect to investment counterparties due to the structure of the liquidity funds which invest in a wide range of very short duration, high quality securities.
Cash balances and deposits are placed only with credit institutions with a financial strength rating of A or above.
To mitigate the risk arising from exposure to reinsurers, the Group only conducts business with companies of specified financial strength ratings.
In addition, most contracts are operated on a funds withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit risk.
The other principal form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders due to the potential for default on credit card payments.
The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and low average level of balance recoverable.
There is also mitigation by the operation of numerous high and low level controls in this area, including payment on policy acceptance as opposed to inception and automated cancellation procedures for policies in default.
The fair value of receivables from policyholders represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.
The group does not use credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate exposure.
The amount of bad debt expense relating to policyholder debt charged to the income statement in 2007 and 2008 is insignificant.
There were no significant financial assets that were past due at the close of either 2008 or 2007.
The Groups credit risk exposure to assets with external ratings is as follows: 31 December 31 December Rating 2008 2007 000 000 Financial institutions Money market funds AAA 310,831 335,608 Financial institutions Credit institutions AA 115,613 133,179 Financial institutions Credit institutions A 128,705 22,591 Reinsurers A 64,491 45,546 Chairmans 4 4- -5 5 6-7 8-9 10-15 16-33 34-47 48-53 54-104 Admiral Admiral Gr Group oup 2008 Financial Chief Executives Business review Governance & Board of Directors Financial statement in in 2008 2008 highlights statement Remuneration & Directors report statements A D M I R A L G R O U P p l c 8 Foreign exchange risks Foreign exchange risks arise from unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates that could adversely impact the valuation of overseas assets.
The Group may be exposed to foreign exchange risk through its expanding operations in Europe.
Although the relative size of the European operations means that the risks are relatively small, increasingly volatile foreign exchange rates result in larger potential gains or losses.
Assets held to fund insurance liabilities are held in the currency of the liabilities, however surplus assets held as regulatory capital in foreign currencies remain exposed.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficient, available, financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.
The Group has traditionally been strongly cash generative due to the large proportion of profit arising from non-underwriting activity.
Further, as noted above, a significant portion of insurance funds are invested in money market liquidity funds with same day liquidity features, meaning that the vast majority of the Group cash and investments are immediately available.
The current uncertainty in credit markets is not likely to impact this.
A breakdown of the Groups financial liabilities trade and other payables is shown in note 22.
In terms of the maturity profile of these liabilities, all amounts may potentially mature within 12 months of the balance sheet date except for a minority of finance lease liabilities which will expire after 12 months.
Refer to note 23 for further detail In practice, the Groups Directors expect actual cashflows to be consistent with this maturity profile except for amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers.
Of the total amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers of 147.9m 2007: 134.7m, 77.5m 2007: 62.9m is held under funds withheld arrangements and therefore not expected to be settled within 12 months.
All financial assets will mature within 12 months.
The Groups Directors believe that the cashflows arising from these assets will be consistent with this profile.
Liquidity risk is therefore considered to be insignificant.
Fair value The carrying value of all of the Groups financial assets equate to fair value.
For money market funds, cash at bank and deposits, the fair value approximates to the book value due to their short maturity.
Objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital For details of objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital, and external capital requirements, refer to the Business review.
