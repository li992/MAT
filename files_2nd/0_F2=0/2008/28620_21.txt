1 Principal accounting policies continued Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash ows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
Dividend income Dividend income from final dividends on equity securities is accounted for on the date the security becomes ex-dividend.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Fees and commissions Portfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognised over the period the service is provided.
Asset management fees are recognised rateably over the period the service is provided.
Commissions receivable and payable are accounted for in the period in which they are earned.
To the extent that retained initial charge income received on the sale of units arises from an identiable brokerage service, the income is recognised on the performance of that service.
Other retained initial charges are deferred and recognised as income on a straight line basis over the estimated average life of the unit holding.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following bases: Leasehold property: over the lease term Plant, equipment and computer hardware: over three to five years The assets residual lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or when other occasions or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the profit and loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to groups of cash generating units that correspond with the Groups segments, as these represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitor goodwill for purposes of impairment testing.
Cash generating units are identied as the smallest identiable group of assets that generates cash inows that are largely independent of the cash inows from other assets or groups of assets.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributed amount of goodwill that has not been subject to impairment is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
b Computer software and software development costs Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specic software.
These costs are amortised on the basis of the expected useful lives three to four years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, which are expected to generate economic benets exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method over their useful lives not exceeding four years.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 69 Notes to the consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Intangible assets continued Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs that are not recognised as assets are recognised as an expense as incurred.
c Client relationships Client relationships acquired are shown at historical cost.
Those in respect of business combinations are initially recognised at fair value.
Client relationships have a nite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the client lists over their estimated useful lives five to fifteen years.
Financial assets The Group classies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held to maturity investments and available for sale financial assets.
The classication of financial assets is determined at initial recognition.
a Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception.
A financial asset is classied in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading and are reported within other assets or other liabilities.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services to a debtor or purchases a loan with no intention of trading the receivable.
c Held to maturity Held to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments and xed maturities that the Groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity, other than those that meet the denition of loans and receivables or that the Group has classied as available for sale or fair value through profit or loss.
d Available for sale Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classied in any of the other categories.
Available for sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held to maturity and available for sale are recognised on trade date the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Loans are recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash ows from the financial assets have expired or been effectively transferred, or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Available for sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables and held to maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets are recognised directly in equity except for changes arising from uctuations in foreign exchange rates, which are recognised as income or expenditure in the income statement for monetary assets and directly in equity for non-monetary assets, until the financial asset is sold, derecognised or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity should be recognised in the income statement.
However, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial instruments in active markets are based on current bid prices.
If the market for a financial asset is not active and for unlisted securities, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash ow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 70 Notes to the consolidated accounts 1 Principal accounting policies continued Deposits and borrowings All deposits and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received.
After initial recognition, deposits and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discounts or premia on settlement.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Work in progress Trust work in progress is included within other assets and is valued at the expected recoverable amount, including an appropriate portion of profit, calculated by reference to the stage of completion of the service rendered.
The corresponding income is recognised within fees and commissions receivable.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outow of economic benets that can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised within interest expense.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring which has been notied to affected parties.
Foreign currencies The Groups functional and presentational currency is sterling.
Transactions in currencies other than the relevant Group entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary financial assets carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into the Groups presentational currency at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in equity within the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Gains and losses arising on translation are taken to the Groups translation reserve.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments denominated in a currency other than the Groups functional currency arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as non-monetary foreign currency items and they are translated using the exchange rate applied on the date of acquisition.
Retirement benefit costs The cost of providing benets under dened benefit plans are determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of profit and loss and are presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benets are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the amended benets become vested.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the dened benefit obligation reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Payments to dened contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 71 Notes to the consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Income tax Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or negative goodwill for which amortisation is not deductible for tax purposes or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the liability is settled or when the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits which may be accessed without penalty.
Cash equivalents comprise short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
For the purposes of the Consolidated cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as dened above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group engages in equity settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees.
The fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the date of the grant.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the Companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
Except for those which include terms related to market conditions, vesting conditions included in the terms of the grant are not taken into account in estimating fair value.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately the amount recognised in the income statement reects the number of vested shares or share options, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Where vesting conditions are related to market conditions, the charges for the services received are recognised regardless of whether or not the market related vesting condition is met, provided that the non-market vesting conditions are met.
Shares purchased and issued are charged directly to equity.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 72 Notes to the consolidated accounts 1 Principal accounting policies continued Segmental reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Direct costs are allocated to the segment that generated the cost.
Indirect costs are allocated to reporting segments so as to reect the proportion of the cost that each segment has generated, on a pro rata basis.
Fiduciary activities The Group commonly acts as trustee and in other duciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions.
These assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the Group.
The Group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the Client Money Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Such monies and the corresponding liability to clients are not shown on the face of the balance sheet as the Group is not beneficially entitled thereto.
Financial guarantees Financial guarantees issued by the Group are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the best estimate of any amount to be paid to settle the guarantee and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, which is recognised over the life of the contract.
2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group makes estimates about a range of long-term trends and market conditions to determine the value of the deficit on its retirement benefit schemes, based on the Groups expectations of the future and advice taken from qualied actuaries.
The principal assumptions underlying the reported deficit of 5,723,000 are given in note 28.
Long-term forecasts and estimates are necessarily highly judgemental and subject to risk that actual events may be signicantly different to those forecast.
If actual events deviate from the assumptions made by the Group then the reported surplus or deficit in respect of retirement benefit obligations may be materially different.
The history of experience adjustments and information on the sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation to changes in underlying estimates is set out in note 28.
Impairment of goodwill The Group makes estimates in relation to the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated in determining whether goodwill is impaired.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 47,023,000.
The assumptions underlying the value in use calculation are set out in note 19.
Share-based payments In determining the fair value of equity settled share-based awards and the related charge to the income statement, the Group makes assumptions about future events and market conditions.
In particular, judgements must be formed as to the likely number of shares that will vest, and the fair value of each award granted.
The fair value of awards is determined using a valuation model which is dependent on further estimates, including the Groups future dividend policy, employee turnover, the timing with which options will be exercised and future volatility in the price of the Groups shares.
Such assumptions are based on publicly available information, where available, and reect market expectations and advice taken from qualied actuaries.
Different assumptions about these factors to those made by the Group could materially affect the reported value of share-based payments.
The assumptions used are set out in note 29.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 73 Notes to the consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty continued Income recognition Revenue in the Trust and Tax business is calculated by reference to the estimated stage of completion of the service rendered.
Estimates are also made as to the recoverability of work in progress and debtors in relation to this income.
At the year end, total work in progress and debtors for Trust and Tax services, net of related provisions for impairment, amounted to 6,300,000, of which 4,545,000 was included within disposal groups 2007: 13,363,000.
Conversely, very little judgement is required in the recognition of income arising from the Investment Management and Unit Trusts businesses due to the close proximity of billing dates to the year end and the inherently non-judgemental nature of interest accrual calculations.
3 Segmental information a Business segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating divisions: Investment Management, Unit Trusts and Trust and Tax.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Transactions between the business segments are on normal commercial terms and conditions.
Intra-segment income constitutes trail commission.
Revenues and expenses are allocated to the business segment that originated the transaction.
Revenues and expenses that are not directly originated by a business segment are reported as unallocated.
Centrally incurred expenses are allocated to business segments on an appropriate pro-rata basis.
Segment assets and liabilities comprise operating assets and liabilities, being the majority of the balance sheet, but exclude items such as taxation and borrowings.
b Geographical segments During 2008, the Groups operations were located in the United Kingdom, Jersey, Switzerland, the British Virgin Islands and Singapore.
The following table provides an analysis of the Groups revenues by geographical market, by origin of the services: Total gross revenues by geographical market 2008 2007 000 000 United Kingdom 170,924 171,556 Jersey 17,581 21,686 Rest of the world 8,489 5,350 196,994 198,592 The following is an analysis of the carrying amount of segment assets, and additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, analysed by the geographical area in which the assets are located: Assets allocated to business segments 2008 2007 000 000 United Kingdom 1,245,186 1,145,684 Jersey 8,070 37,123 Rest of the world 25,971 20,651 1,279,227 1,203,458 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 75 Notes to the consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 3 Segmental information continued b Geographical segments continued Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 2008 2007 000 000 United Kingdom 11,297 9,790 Jersey 445 301 Rest of the world 70 126 11,812 10,217 c Total gross revenues 2007 2008 000 000 restated note 1 Interest and similar income 69,095 51,573 Fee and commission income 106,656 122,130 Dividend income 134 67 Net trading income 480 1,676 Net income from sale of available for sale securities 1,297 Other operating income 1,986 1,518 Discontinued operations 18,643 20,331 Total gross revenues 196,994 198,592 Interest expense and similar charges 38,035 32,282 Fee and commission expense 8,565 11,499 Discontinued operations 286 Total operating income including discontinued operations 150,394 154,525 4 Business combinations On 1 April 2008, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Citywall Financial Management Limited for cash consideration of 1,214,000.
Contingent, deferred consideration is also payable dependent on the value of discretionary funds under management introduced by the business at 5 April 2009 and 30 September 2009.
The acquired business net assets at the acquisition date were as follows: Recognised Fair value Carrying values adjustments amounts 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 480 480 Other current assets 115 115 Property, plant and equipment 10 10 Client relationships 565 565 Current liabilities 225 225 Net identifiable assets acquired 945 565 380 Goodwill on acquisition 664 Purchase consideration 1,609 Included within the Consolidated income statement for the year is a loss before tax, including acquisition costs, of 62,000 relating to the acquired business.
If the business had been acquired on 1 January 2008, consolidated operating income from continuing operations would have been 131,986,000 and consolidated profit before income tax from continuing operations would have been 42,779,000.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to the anticipated profitability of incorporating the business into the Groups operating model.

Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 90 Notes to the consolidated accounts 28 Long term employee benets The Group operates a defined contribution group personal pension scheme and contributes to various other personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
The total of contributions made to this scheme during the year was 952,000 2007: 697,000.
The Group also operates defined contribution schemes for overseas employees, for which the total contributions were 518,000 2007: 581,000 of which 489,000 relates to discontinued operations 2007: 540,000.
The Group operates two funded pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable pay for executive directors and staff employed by the Company in the UK the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and the Laurence Keen Scheme.
The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Investment Management Limited, with investments managed on a discretionary basis, in accordance with the statement of investment principles agreed by the trustees.
Scheme assets are held separately from those of the Group.
The trustees of the fund are required to act in the best interest of the funds beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees to the fund is determined by the schemes trust documentation and legislation.
The Group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the fund.
The scheme operated by Rathbone Stockbrokers Limited the Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future pension accrual for the current membership with effect from 1 October 1999.
As from that date all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.
Both schemes continue on a closed basis with the existing assets remaining invested thereunder.
The Group provides death in service benefits to all employees through the 1987 pension scheme.
Third party insurance is purchased for the benefits where available and 864,000 of related insurance premia were expensed to the income statement in the year 2007: 624,000.
The estimated present value of the uninsured death in service benefits is included in long term employee benefits liabilities.
The schemes are valued by independent actuaries every three years using the projected unit credit method which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, discounted to a present value using a rate that reflects the characteristics of the liability.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as follows: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2007 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2005 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, by the liability, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The principal actuarial assumptions used, which reflect the different membership profiles of the schemes, were: 2008 2007 2008 2007 Laurence Keen Scheme % Laurence Keen Scheme % Rathbone 1987 Scheme % Rathbone 1987 Scheme % Rate of increase in salaries 4.05 4.55 4.05 4.55 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.40 3.60 2.80 3.20 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.80 3.30 2.80 3.30 Discount rate 6.15 5.70 6.15 5.70 Expected return on scheme assets 5.30 6.10 6.40 7.10 Inflation assumption 2.80 3.30 2.80 3.30 5% for service prior to April 2001 The assumed duration of the liabilities for both schemes is 25 years 2007: 25 years.
The overall expected return on scheme assets is a weighted average of the returns expected on each class of asset held by the scheme, as disclosed below.
Normal retirement age is 65 for members of the Laurence Keen Scheme and 60 for members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.
The assumed life expectancy for the membership of both schemes is based on the PA00 actuarial tables.
In 2008, the assumption for life expectancy was updated to take account of recent and expected future improvements in life expectancy by using the Medium Cohort projection, with a 0.75% underpin for males and a 0.5% underpin for females.

The fund is invested in long dated interest rate swaps, the duration of which is intended to broadly align with the duration of the schemes liabilities.
The expected return on equities was assumed to be 3.25% above the return on long dated Gilts 2007: 3.20% above.
The expected rate of return on debt instruments is based on long-term yields at the start of the year, with an adjustment for the risk of default and future downgrade in relation to corporate bonds.
Cash has been assumed to generate a similar return to short dated government bonds.
The statement of investment principles set by the trustees requires that the assets of the scheme are invested in a balanced portfolio in the following sectors and proportions: Laurence Keen Scheme Rathbone 1987 Scheme UK equities 35% 55% 43% 57% Overseas equities 0% 15% 21% 35% Fixed interest stocks 45% 65% 14% 28% Cash deposits 45% 65% 0% 8% The total allocation of assets in the Laurence Keen Scheme to fixed interest stocks and cash deposits is expressed as a combined percentage of the two asset classes in the statement of investment principles.
In the Rathbone 1987 Scheme, not more than 85% of the assets may be held in equities.
A maximum of 5% of UK equities may be invested in companies outside the FTSE 350 and not more than 5% of total equity assets can be invested in hedge funds.

No additional lump sum contributions were paid in 2008 2007: 3,890,000.
Following the triennial valuation of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme, the Group has committed to make additional contributions to the scheme of 2,750,000 per year until 2016.
After 31 March 2002 the Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants and, consequently, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the Scheme approach retirement.
The total contributions made by the Group to the Laurence Keen Scheme during the year were 455,000 2007: 467,000.
Annual contributions of 420,000 will continue to be made to the Laurence Keen Scheme.
As the scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 October 1999, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

31 Financial risk management The Group has identified the risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite, as described in the Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Services Authority the FSA in its application of the Capital Requirements Directive.
The Group categorises its financial risks into three areas: i credit risk: ii liquidity risk: and iii market risk which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, currency risk and price risk.
The sections below outline the Groups risk appetite and explain how it defines and manages each category of financial risk.
The Groups risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the risks that the Group faces, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor the risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up to date information systems.
The Group regularly reviews its risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the business, counterparties, markets and the range of financial instruments that it utilises.
The Groups overall strategy and policies for monitoring and management of financial risk are set by the board of directors the Board.
The Board has embedded risk management within the business through the boards of directors of the Groups operating subsidiaries and certain of the Boards standing committees.
The principal committees that have responsibility for the identification, mitigation and management of risks are the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, the Risk Management Committee and the Banking Committee, which is a standing committee of the board of directors of Rathbone Investment Management Limited.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 97 Notes to the consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 31 Financial risk management continued The Treasury Department, reporting through the Banking Committee, has principal responsibility for monitoring exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Procedures and delegated authorities are documented in a Group Treasury Manual and policy documents are in place to cover the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
The primary objective of the Groups treasury policy is to manage short-term liquidity requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of exposure to other financial risks in accordance with the Groups risk appetite.
i Credit risk The Group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its Banking, Treasury, Trust and Pensions advisory activities.
The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds with other banks and holding interest bearing securities.
The Group also has exposure to credit risk through its loan books and guarantees given on clients behalf.
It is the Groups policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with a range of high quality financial institutions.
Investments are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are secured against clients assets that are held and managed by Group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits.
Limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations.
The Group categorises its exposures based on the long-term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch Ratings Ltd Fitch or Moodys Corporation Moodys.
Each exposure is assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring.
In addition to formal external ratings, the banking committee also utilises market intelligence information to assist its ongoing monitoring.
Settlement balances Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash or transfer of a security is made in the expectation of a corresponding delivery of a security or receipt of cash.
The majority of transactions are carried out on a delivery versus payment basis, which results in securities and cash being exchanged within a very close timeframe.
Settlement balances outside standard terms are monitored on a daily basis.
The Investment Management and Unit Trust businesses have exposure to market counterparties in the settlement of trades.
Settlement balances of 6,322,000 were past due but not impaired at 31 December 2008 2007: 1,123,000.
No settlement balances were impaired at the balance sheet date 2007: nil.
Loans and advances to banks and debt and other securities The Group has exposures to a wide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio, which includes bank deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds and government bonds.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of surplus investment management client cash, which is held under a banking relationship, and the Groups own reserves.
The Groups policy requires that all such exposures are only taken with counterparties that have been awarded a minimum long-term rating of A by Fitch or equivalent rating by Moodys.
Counterparty limits are also in place to limit exposure to an individual counterparty or connected group of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are monitored on a daily basis and reviewed by the Banking Committee on a monthly basis.
The Banking Committee may suspend dealing in a particular counterparty, or liquidate specific holdings, in the light of adverse market information.
Loans and advances to customers The Group provides loans to clients through its Investment Management operations the Investment Management loan book and via Rathbone International Finance B. V. the Rathbone International Finance loan book.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk on trade debtors arising from the trust and tax and pensions advisory businesses Trust and Pension debtors.
a Overdrafts Overdrafts on clients investment management accounts arise from time to time due to short-term timing differences between the purchase and sale of assets on clients behalf.
Overdrafts are actively monitored and reported to the banking committee on a monthly basis.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 98 Notes to the consolidated accounts 31 Financial risk management continued i Credit risk continued b Investment Management loan book Loans and short term overdrafts are provided as a service to Investment Management clients who are generally asset rich but have short to medium term cash requirements.
Such loans are normally made on a fully secured basis against portfolios held in Rathbones nominee name and are advanced for a maximum of one year.
Extensions to the initial loan period may be granted if required.
The lending exposure limit for the Investment Management loan book is 25m.
The Banking Committee reviews all loans on a monthly basis and approves all loan extensions.
Where necessary, repayment plans are established with clients before the loan becomes overdue or uncovered.
At 31 December, the total lending exposure limit for the Investment Management loan book was 25,000,000 2007: 25,000,000 of which 12,459,000 had been advanced 2007: 11,889,000 and a further 4,555,000 had been committed 2007: 4,492,000. c Rathbone International Finance loan book Loans are also provided to non-UK borrowers to assist trust structures where the Group acts as trustee or provides some form of advisory role.
Such loans are backed by loans to the Group from third parties which are on identical repayment and interest rate repricing terms.
Loans are secured either by a legal charge over client cash or other assets under the Groups control, or by waiver of right of recall from the third party lender in the event that the borrower is unable to repay.
New loan applications and applications to extend existing facilities under the Rathbone International Finance loan book are reviewed by the directors of Rathbone International Finance B. V. and require pre-approval by the chief executive of the trust and tax business.
At 31 December loans outstanding in the Rathbone International Finance loan book totalled 18,323,000 2007: 14,343,000. d Trust and Pension debtors Trust and Pension debtors relate to fees which have been invoiced but not yet settled by clients.
The collection and ageing of Trust and Pension debtors are reviewed on a monthly basis by the management committees of the Groups trust and pension advisory companies.
Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection.
e Other debtors Other loans and advances to customers is constituted by a vendor loan note made to Hawksford International Holdings Limited on its acquisition of Rathbone Trust Company Jersey Limited and Rathbone Jersey Limited from the Group on 15 October 2008 see note 12.
Derivatives The Group makes limited use of derivative financial instruments exclusively to manage interest rate risk and not for speculative purposes see note 24.
The Group maintains control limits on net open derivative positions i. e. the difference between purchase and sale contracts, by both amount and term.
At any one time, the amount subject to credit risk is limited to the current fair value of instruments that are favourable to the Group i. e. contracts with a positive fair value, which in relation to derivatives is only a small fraction of the notional value of the contract.
Impairment and provisioning policies Impairment provisions are recognised for financial reporting purposes only for losses that have been incurred at the balance sheet date, based on objective evidence of impairment.
All credit exposures are reviewed individually, at least annually or more regularly when individual circumstances require.
Impairment allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at balance sheet date on a case-by-case basis.
The assessment considers, where applicable, the value of any collateral held, any changes to the external credit rating and the anticipated receipts for each individual exposure.
Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to Trust and Pension debtors, are set out in note 17.

For on balance sheet assets, the exposures set out above are based on net carrying amounts as reported in the balance sheet.
As shown above, 17.8% of the total maximum exposure is derived from loans and advances to banks and customers 2007: 25.9% and 77.9% represents investments in debt securities 2007: 68.4%.

Debt securities The table below presents an analysis of debt securities by rating agency designation, as at 31 December, based on Fitchs or Moodys long-term rating designation.
The banking committee actively monitors counterparties and may reduce risk by either suspending dealing or liquidating investments in the light of adverse market information, for example in anticipation of or in response to any formal Fitch or Moodys rating downgrade.
This may happen in relation to specific banks or banks within a particular country or sector.

The primary objective of the Groups treasury policy is to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
The treasury department has primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Groups liquidity policy, which requires that Rathbone Investment Management the Bank maintains a surplus of immediately realisable assets over its liabilities such that all known and potential cash obligations can be met.
Liquidity mismatches are monitored on a daily basis against the liquidity limits set by the banking committee and the Financial Services Authoritys liquidity mismatch guidelines.
Liquidity risk is primarily managed by holding cash and marketable instruments which are realisable at short notice.
The Group operates a strict set of criteria for counterparties to ensure that investments are liquid and are with high quality counterparties, defined as those who have been awarded a long-term rating of A or above by Fitch or equivalent by Moodys.
The Group does not rely on external funding for its activities.
Current market conditions have resulted in an increase in the level of liquidity in investment management clients portfolios as investment managers position assets more defensively.
Consequently, the Group is increasingly a net provider of liquidity to the banking markets.

Derivative cash ows derivatives settled on a net basis As described in note 24 the Group employs Forward Rate Agreements in managing interest rate risk.
The Groups liquidity risk in relation to net settled derivative contracts is limited to the fair value of unsettled contracts.
There were no unsettled contracts at 31 December 2008.

Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
In particular, customer accounts and loan balances are repriced very shortly after changes in base rates, whereas the yield on the Groups interest bearing assets is correlated to the future expectation of base rates and varies depending on the maturity profile of the Groups treasury portfolio.
The average maturity mismatch is controlled by the banking committee, which generally lengthens the mismatch when the yield curve is rising and shortens it when the yield curve is falling.
The tables below and overleaf show the consolidated repricing profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

The potential total profit or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to repricing of the interest bearing liabilities compared with the period to repricing on a corresponding amount of interest bearing assets.
At 31 December 2008, the Bank had 993.4 million 2007: 902.3 million of sterling interest bearing liabilities averaging 4 days 2007: 3 days to repricing which were matched by sterling assets averaging 52 days 2007: 50 days to repricing, creating an exposure of 48 days 2007: 47 days.
The total potential impact on profit after tax and equity was 1,894,000 2007: 1,650,000 at the balance sheet date for a 2% decrease or increase in interest rates.
The Group held no forward rate agreements at 31 December 2008.
The impact of the Groups forward rate agreements at 31 December 2007 was to reduce this exposure by 35,000.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 108 Notes to the consolidated accounts 31 Financial risk management continued iii Market risk continued Foreign exchange risk The Group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on a daily basis and significant exposures are managed through the use of spot contracts so as to reduce any currency exposure to a minimal amount.
At 31 December 2008, the Group was also subject to a structural currency exposure on its net investments in overseas subsidiaries, primarily in Switzerland, Singapore and the British Virgin Islands.
The Group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign currency risk and, therefore, no sensitivity analysis is presented.
The table below summarises the Groups exposure to foreign currency translation risk at 31 December.
Included in the table are the Groups financial assets and liabilities, at carrying amounts, categorised by currency.
The Group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 18.
At 31 December 2008, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was 2,991,000 2007: 6,948,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax impact on net assets of 299,000 2007: 695,000 there would be no impact on profit after tax.
Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of held to maturity investment securities note 18.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2008 109 Notes to the consolidated accounts Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 32 Capital management Accounting capital is dened as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves.
Regulatory capital is derived from the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, which is a requirement of the Capital Requirements Directive.
The ICAAP draws on the Groups risk management process which is embedded within the individual businesses, function heads and executive committees within the Group.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to comply with the capital requirements set by the regulators of the banking and other regulated markets where the entities within the Group operate: to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benets for other stakeholders: and to maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.
The Groups regulatory capital is monitored by the treasury department and is divided into two tiers: Tier 1 capital, which is the total of issued share capital, retained earnings and reserves created by appropriations of retained earnings, net of the book value of goodwill and other intangible assets: and Tier 2 capital, which is unrealised gains arising on the fair valuation of equity instruments held as available for sale.
In calculating the capital requirement, the Group has adopted the standardised approach to credit risk and the basic indicator approach to operational risk.
The ICAAP was approved by the Rathbone Brothers Plc board in December 2008 and was formally reviewed and agreed with the Financial Services Authority in February 2009.
There have been no capital requirement breaches during the course of the year.
33 Contingent liabilities and commitments a Indemnities are provided to a number of directors and employees in our Trust and Tax division in connection with them acting as directors on client structures in the normal course of business.
b Capital expenditure authorised and contracted for at 31 December 2008 but not provided in the accounts amounted to 150,000 2007: 1,189,000. c The contractual amounts of the Groups commitments to extend credit to its clients are as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Guarantees 859 724 Undrawn commitments to lend of 1 year or less 4,555 4,492 5,414 5,216 The fair value of the guarantees is nil 2007: nil.
d The Group leases various offices under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
The future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases were as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 No later than 1 year 5,037 4,724 Later than 1 year and no later than 5 years 14,813 14,000 Later than 5 years 11,984 9,037 31,834 27,761 e In addition to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme levies accrued in the year note 9 further levy charges are likely to be incurred in future years although the ultimate cost remains uncertain.
