Details of their share awards that are not fully vested are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report, and the charge in relation to the year ended 31 December 2008 is set out below.
The Company has used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the awards.
The fair value of awards with options outstanding at 31 December 2008 is shown in note 5 c of the group accounts on page 48.

78 Reckitt Benckiser 2008 7 SHARE BASED REMUNERATION CONTINUED Notes Contractual life: Executive Share Awards have a contractual life of ten years but vest according to EPS growth criteria over a three-year period.
Accordingly, the cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
Other share awards have contractual lives of either three, five or seven years.
Performance criteria: Executive Share Awards are subject to performance criteria based on compound average annual growth CAAG rates in earnings per share over the performance period.
Other Share Awards are generally not subject to any criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Executive Share Awards included in the above table vest as follows: CAAG of 6%: 40% of awards vest: 7% CAAG: 60%: 8% CAAG: 80%: 9% CAAG: 100%.
The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the Plans, early exercise is not permitted and therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also assumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to the Plans in 2008 or 2007 for the purposes of the valuation.
Volatility: An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period, to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
Income statement charge: the income statement charge may not exactly equal one third of the total fair value included in the table above due to adjustments for in-year lapses or award revisions.
