NORTHUMBRIAN WATER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2008 77 7.
Taxation continued Future capital allowances claims are subject to proposals announced by the UK Government on 21 March 2007 to revise the rates of allowances with effect from 1 April 2008.
The proposed changes are expected to become law when the Finance Act 2008 is enacted and include a reduction in the rate of allowance for items of general plant and machinery from 25% to 20% per annum: an increase in the rate for long life assets from 6% to 10% per annum: the phased abolition of industrial building allowances by 31 March 2011: and the introduction of a new rate of 10% per annum for fixtures that are integral to buildings and structures.
The Finance Act 2007 has already removed any potential balancing adjustments in respect of assets on which industrial building allowances are being claimed.
In the directors view, if all the changes to industrial buildings allowances had been enacted or substantively enacted by the date of these financial statements, the Groups deferred tax liability at 31 March 2008 would have been increased by approximately 117.0 million.
