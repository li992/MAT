Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the European Union and with IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its Company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
The Group financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, share-based payments and assets of post-retirement benefit schemes which are measured at fair value.
The following standards or interpretations to existing standards have been adopted for the first time during the year: Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements - Capital Disclosures.
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment.
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 - Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
The adoption of IFRS 7 has resulted in additional disclosure in the financial statements in respect of the Group's financial instruments and financial risk management.
The adoption of the amendment to IAS 1 has resulted in additional disclosure about the Group's capital structure.
They have had no impact on the results or net assets of the Group.
The following standards or interpretations to existing standards have been published but are not mandatory for the year ended 31 August 2008 and consequently have not been adopted by the Group in the year: IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements IAS 23 Revised Borrowing Costs IAS 27 Revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Reclassification of Financial Assets Amendment to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation None of the above standards or interpretations are expected to have a significant impact on the results or net assets of the Group.
The principal accounting policies adopted for the year ended 31 August 2008, which have been consistently applied, are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements comprise the financial statements of Fenner PLC and subsidiaries controlled by the Group as at 31 August each year, together with the Groups share of the results of associates and joint ventures, as detailed below.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
a Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group at the date of completion, plus any costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
The subsidiarys identifiable assets and liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary the accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries are adjusted to bring them into line with those used by the Group.
Minority interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of acquisition and the minoritys share of changes in equity since the date of acquisition.
Fenner PLC 43 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued b Interests in joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control with third parties, where the financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activity requires the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The Groups interest in joint ventures is incorporated in the financial statements using the proportionate consolidation method.
The Groups share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of joint ventures are combined with the equivalent items in the Group financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Where a Group entity transacts with a joint venture, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in that entity.
Foreign currencies a Functional and presentation currency The individual financial statements of each entity in the Group are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates the functional currency.
The Group financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the presentation currency of the Group.
b Transactions and balances Transactions in currencies other than an entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement and retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement in the period.
c Net investment in foreign operations For the consolidation of operations where the functional currency is different to the Groups presentation currency, the assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date and income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising are recognised directly in equity in the exchange reserve.
On disposal of such operations, the cumulative exchange differences are included in the profit or loss on disposal.
The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 'First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards' to reset to zero the cumulative exchange differences in equity at 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations are treated as assets and liabilities of that operation and are retranslated at the closing rate at each balance sheet date.
The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 to not apply this to goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer.
Revenue from short term service contracts is recognised in the period in which the services are completed.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Royalty income is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of their fair value at the inception of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised in the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Government grants Government grants in respect of property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income in the balance sheet and are recognised in the income statement over the expected useful life of the relevant asset.
Government grants in respect of revenue expenditure are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the related expenditure is incurred.
44 Fenner PLC Share-based payments The Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share schemes for certain employees.
The cost of equity-settled share-based payments is measured at fair value at the date of grant, excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
The cost is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with the corresponding amount credited to equity, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair values are measured using the Binomial option-pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation approach.
The cost of cash-settled share-based payments is measured as per the equity-settled payments, except that it is recalculated at each subsequent reporting date.
In addition, the corresponding amount is credited to trade and other payables instead of equity.
The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Post-retirement benefits The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
For defined contribution pension schemes, payments are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Service costs are recognised in the income statement to spread the cost over the expected lives of the employees.
Net finance costs or income are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they are incurred.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the excess of the present value of scheme liabilities over the fair value of scheme assets.
The cost of providing other post-retirement benefits, principally private healthcare, is determined from actuarial valuations carried out at each balance sheet date using the same principles as defined benefit pension schemes.
The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 to recognise in full the cumulative actuarial gains and losses at 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
The Group has also adopted the Amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits permitting the recognition of actuarial gains and losses in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are items of income and expense that are material and relevant to an understanding of the Groups financial performance and may be operating or non-operating in nature.
In accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, such items are presented separately on the face of the income statement and analysed in the notes to the financial statements.
Taxation Taxation expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on taxable profit for the period using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable or deductible or are taxable or deductible in other years.
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, unless specifically exempt.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
The resulting charge or credit is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the charge or credit is also recognised directly in equity.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Segmental reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services business segment or in providing products and services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
The Group reports separate information on its material operations for each of the Groups segments.
The Groups primary segment is the business sector and its secondary segment is the geographical area.
Fenner PLC 45 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost or deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 to record the previously revalued freehold land and buildings as deemed cost at 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other assets is recognised in the income statement to write down the value of the asset to its residual value on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset from the date it is brought into use.
Estimated useful lives most widely applied are as follows: Freehold buildings 40 years Leasehold buildings Unexpired term of lease Plant, machinery and equipment 3-10 years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Any excess of the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired entity over cost is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is included within the carrying amount of the investment.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has been recorded at the previous UK GAAP carrying amount at that date, subject to any impairment required at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 continues to be included in reserves and is not included in any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value.
Other intangible assets are initially recognised at cost.
Intangible assets are subsequently stated at fair value or cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Estimated useful lives most widely applied are as follows: Computer software 3-5 years Brands 20 years Trademarks 5-20 years Customer relationships 10-16 years Technology based assets 5 years Impairment The carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
46 Fenner PLC Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss previously been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit.
Any reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial assets Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
a Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
b Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents also includes bank overdrafts as they are an integral part of the Groups cash management.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
a Trade payables Trade payables are measured at amortised cost.
b Borrowings Bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are initially measured at fair value less direct arrangement fees and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
c Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including forward foreign currency contracts, options, interest rate and currency swaps and nonderivative cash instruments, including foreign currency borrowings, to hedge its exposure to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fenner PLC 47 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity.
Amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or the ineffective portion of financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument in equity at that time is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to the income statement in the period.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain assumptions, estimates and judgements that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
These are based on historical experience and any other factors, including expectations of future events, that are considered appropriate, and these are continually reviewed.
Subsequent actual results may however differ from these estimates and judgements.
Areas where assumptions, estimates and judgements may give rise to risk of material adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are as follows: Taxation notes 9 and 15 Impairment of goodwill note 13 Inventory provisions note 16 Provisions for impairment of trade receivables note 17 Retirement benefit obligations note 25 Share-based payments note 26 Provisions note 27 Contingencies note 30 Acquisitions note 33 3.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of certain tax losses amounting to 2.7m 2007: 4.9m since it is not envisaged that such profits will be available in the foreseeable future.
In addition, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of UK capital losses of 0.6m 2007: 0.6m since it is not envisaged that suitable capital gains will be available in the foreseeable future.
56 Fenner PLC Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Financial risk management In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to certain financial risks, principally foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks are managed by the central treasury function in conjunction with the operating units, in accordance with risk management policies that are designed to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on financial performance.
The policies are reviewed and approved by the Board.
Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations around the world and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in foreign operations.
Where cost effective, the exposures arising from the translation of the net assets of the Groups foreign operations are managed through the use of borrowings in the relevant foreign currency.
Some Group operations also enter into commercial transactions in currencies other than their functional currencies.
Exposures arising from the translation of foreign currency transactions are continually monitored and material exposures are managed through the use of forward contracts or options once cash flows can be identified with sufficient certainty.
Exposures arising from the translation of intra-group lending are managed through the use of borrowings in the relevant foreign currency.
The following table shows the impact due to the retranslation of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities in the Group's operations of a 10% movement in the Groups principal foreign currency exchange rates at the year end date.
10% increase 10% decrease Effect on Effect on Effect on Effect on profit before shareholders' profit before shareholders' taxation equity taxation equity 31 August 2008 US dollar 0.2 - 0.2 - Euro - 0.7 - 0.9 Australian dollar - 0.5 - 0.6 31 August 2007 US dollar - - - - Euro 0.2 0.6 0.2 0.7 Australian dollar - 0.1 - 0.1 The effect on profit before taxation is due to the retranslation of trade receivables, cash, borrowings, trade payables and derivative financial assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
The effect on shareholders equity is due to the hedge of net investments in foreign currencies.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate risk arises on floating rate borrowings and short term cash deposits.
This is reviewed regularly and is managed through the use of an appropriate mix of fixed rate and floating rate instruments, including the use of interest rate swaps, in response to market conditions.
The impact of interest rate risk on the Group's result is due to changes in interest rates on net floating rate cash and borrowings.
At 31 August 2008, if interest rates on the Group's net floating rate cash and borrowings had been 100 basis points higher, with all other variables held constant, the effect on profit before taxation in the year would have been a charge of 0.1m 2007: nil.
A reduction of 100 basis points would have the equal and opposite effect.
There is no impact on shareholders' equity.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure that sufficient resources are available to fund short term working capital and longer term strategic requirements.
This is achieved through an appropriate mix of long and short term borrowings.
It is the Group's policy that there should be sufficient long term committed debt facilities available such that the major part of the Group's total borrowings would not mature for at least one year.
The Group regularly reviews expected cash flows against availability of financing.
Fenner PLC 59 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 20.
Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk principally arises on short term cash deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables.
The credit risk arising on short term cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is managed through the use of counterparties with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group only trades with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to take on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The credit risk arising on trade receivables is spread across a large number of customers and across many countries.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
Capital management The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators: Gearing ratio 2008 2007 97.6 36.3 Net debt m 205.9 142.7 Total equity m 47.4 25.4 Gearing ratio % Gearing comprises net debt divided by total equity.

For compliance with loan covenants, the EBITDA reported above is adjusted for, inter alia, acquisitions and disposals, which makes the net debt to EBITDA ratio significantly lower.
Interest cover 2008 2007 Operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items m 49.3 39.0 Net interest payable on bank overdrafts and loans, other loans and bank interest receivable m 7.2 4.4 Interest cover times 6.8 8.9 Interest cover comprises operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items divided by net interest payable on bank overdrafts and loans, other loans and bank interest receivable.

During the year, an additional 15.6m was drawn down under a committed facility maturing in May 2013.
Other loans principally relate to two US dollar private placements as detailed below.
$27.2m 2007: $34.1m of Senior Notes bear interest at 7.29% per annum, with an amount of $6.8m repayable annually on 1 June each year until 2012.
$90.0m 2007: $90.0m of Senior Notes bear interest at 5.78% per annum and are repayable on 1 June 2017.
$27.2m 14.9m of this amount has been swapped into Euros.
This results in an underlying Euro borrowing of 20.0m at a fixed interest rate of 5.05%.
The swap matures on 1 June 2017 when the private placement is repayable.
Arrangement fees of 0.3m are being amortised over the life of the loan.
Bank balances are stated net where a legal right of offset exists.

The interest rates on floating rate borrowings are principally linked to LIBOR or similar local currency rates.
The carrying amount and fair value of borrowings is as follows: 2008 2007 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value m m m m 13.7 13.7 10.2 10.2 Current borrowings 127.5 125.2 92.2 93.4 Non-current borrowings 141.2 138.9 102.4 103.6 The fair value of fixed rate borrowings represents the value of replacing the existing fixed rate liabilities at the balance sheet date with borrowings with similar terms to the remaining life of the loans.
The fair value of all other floating rate borrowings approximates to their carrying amounts where rates are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
At 31 August 2008, the Group had available 51.3m 2007: 41.5m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities which expire between June 2012 and May 2013.
Current borrowings of 0.1m 2007: 0.1m and non-current borrowings of 0.7m 2007: 0.4m are secured on specific freehold property.

The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts represents the gain or loss resulting from translation of the contracts using forward rates at the balance sheet date compared to actual contract rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign currency options represents the market value of a comparable instrument at the balance sheet date.
Forward foreign currency contracts and options The loss on forward foreign currency contracts and options of 1.0m 2007: 0.3m has been recognised in the income statement.
62 Fenner PLC Currency swaps The currency swap is in respect of US dollars that have been swapped into Euros, as detailed in note 22.
The post-tax loss of 0.2m 2007: nil is recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders' equity.
Interest rate swaps The interest on US bank loans of $40.0m has been fixed by means of a US dollar denominated interest rate swap at an effective rate of 6.37% including variable bank margin and designated as a hedge.
The post-tax loss of 0.6m 2007: 0.1m is recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders equity.
Hedge of net investments in foreign currencies Group financial instruments denominated in Euros of 8.1m 2007: 6.8m and Australian dollars of 5.2m 2007: 0.4m are designated as hedges of the net investment in overseas subsidiaries.

Post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit post-retirement schemes for qualifying employees in operations around the world.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The cost of the schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
The principal scheme is the Fenner Pension Scheme which is based in the UK.
The most recent triennial valuation of the Fenner Pension Scheme, whilst yet to be formally completed, was carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2008.
The actuarial valuations for all schemes were updated as at 31 August 2008 by independent qualified actuaries.
The principal assumptions used to determine the assets and liabilities of the schemes are as follows: 2008 2007 UK Overseas UK Overseas scheme schemes scheme schemes 6.3% 5.5% - 6.4% 5.7% 5.1% - 6.0% Discount rate 3.7% 2.3% - 2.5% 3.1% 2.0% - 2.5% Inflation rate 4.7% 2.3% - 4.5% 4.1% 3.0% - 4.5% Rate of increase in salaries Rate of increase in pensions in payment subject to Limited Price Indexation increases: 3.4% - 3.0% - - capped at 5.0% 2.3% - 2.2% - - capped at 2.5% 3.7% - 3.1% - Rate of increase for deferred pensioners subject to statutory revaluation Expected rate of return on assets of the scheme: 7.9% 7.0% - 8.0% 7.9% 7.0% - 8.0% - Equities 5.0% 6.4% - 7.0% 4.9% 5.4% - 7.0% - Bonds 5.0% - 5.8% - - Cash The principal assumptions of the schemes are determined using appropriate expert advice and available market data.
The assumptions of the overseas schemes are given as a range of values in respect of the individual schemes.
The range of values is a consequence of the diversity of territories in which the Group operates defined benefit schemes.

Share-based payments The Group operates three equity-settled share-based payment schemes and two cash-settled schemes.
The recognition and measurement principles of IFRS 2 have not been applied to equity instruments that were granted on or prior to 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005, in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1. a Fenner PLC 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme Share options were granted to certain employees within the Group.
The exercise price of options granted is set at the market price of the shares on the date of the grant.
The vesting period is generally 3 years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of the grant the options expire.
Options can only be exercised upon satisfaction of performance criteria.
This requires that the overall growth of the Groups earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items over a consecutive three year period exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9%.
The last grant of shares under the Executive Share Option Scheme was made in November 2004.
