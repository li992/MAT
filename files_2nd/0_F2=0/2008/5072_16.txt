x71226 Rhouse back p2 cg:x71226 Rhouse back p2 cg 5 9 08 10:53 Page 7 40 eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 50 per cent of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date at which control is transferred to the Group using the purchase method of accounting, whereby the recognised identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
They are excluded from the consolidated financial statements from the date that control ceases.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
The Group applies a policy of treating transactions with minority interests as transactions with parties external to the Group.
Purchases of minority interests shareholdings result in goodwill, being the difference between any consideration paid and of the share acquired of the carrying value of the net assets of the relevant subsidiary.
Disposals to minority interests result in gains and losses for the Group that are recorded in the income statement.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All inter-company transactions and balances between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
When the financial year end of a subsidiary differs from the Groups year end, the subsidiary is consolidated using management accounts for the relevant period.
In accordance with SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities, the results of one entity, an insurance cell, are consolidated as a special purpose entity as the activities of the insurance cell are conducted on behalf of the Group according to its specific business needs so that the Group obtains the benefits of the insurance cells operation.
Joint ventures An entity is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint control over its operating and financial policies.
The Groups interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for by proportionate consolidation, whereby the Groups share of joint venture income and expenses, assets and liabilities and cash flows are combined on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the consolidated financial statements of joint ventures to bring the accounting policies used in to line with those used by the Group.
The Group recognises only the proportion of gains or losses on the sale of assets to joint ventures that is attributable to other venturers.
The Group does not recognise its share of gains or losses from joint ventures that result from the Groups purchase of assets from them until it re-sells those assets to an external entity.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives on the following rates: Long leasehold land and buildings Period of lease Alterations to leasehold property Period of lease Fixtures and fittings 20-33% Equipment 20-50% Motor vehicles 20-33% Buildings 2% An item of property, plant and equipment is fide-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use.
Any gain or loss arising on fide-recognition of the asset is recognised in the income statement in the period the asset is fide-recognised.
Assets residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial period end.
Changes in expected useful lives are accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.
Borrowing costs incurred on the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
This involves recognising identifiable assets including intangible assets not previously recognised by the acquiree and liabilities including contingent liabilities of acquired businesses at fair value.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost being the excess of the fair value of the consideration exchanged including directly attributable acquisition costs over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Where the net fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds consideration, the excess or negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units.
Each cash generating unit or group of cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is not larger than a segment based on either the Groups primary or secondary reporting format determined in accordance with IAS14 Segment Reporting.
x71226 Rhouse back p1 cg:x71226 Rhouse back p1 cg 4 9 08 10:29 Page 8 41 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 eaga Gains and losses on the disposal of a business component are calculated on a basis which incorporates the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business sold.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost on initial recognition.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Fair values are based on market values where available.
Where market values are not readily available, the Group establishes fair value using valuation techniques: these include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other similar instruments and discounted cash flow analysis.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The Group has no internally generated intangibles which meet the recognition criteria.
Expenditure on internally generated intangibles is recognised in the income statement in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets, representing the period of their expected benefit to the Group, are as follows: Acquisition intangibles Over life of the intangible asset typically 2-10 years Computer software 2-5 years Patent assets Over life of patent typically 5-20 years Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
Assets' amortisation periods and amortisation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial period end.
Any gain or loss arising on fide-recognition of intangible assets is measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets and is recognised in the income statement in the period the asset is fide-recognised.
Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Where fair value cannot be determined then the recoverable amount will be determined by reference to value in use.
Value in use is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in that expense category consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of any amount recoverable.
A previously recognised impairment loss is only reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first in first out basis and comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their location and condition at the balance sheet date.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand, short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet and within cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement.
The Group holds certain restricted cash balances in relation to its insurance activities which are included in current asset investments.
Provisions Provisions for liabilities and charges are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably measured.
If the effect is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate.
x71226 Rhouse back p1 cg:x71226 Rhouse back p1 cg 4 9 08 10:29 Page 9 42 eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Employee pension obligations The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans.
The Group pays contributions to corporate or individually administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further obligation under these plans once the contributions have been paid.
Horrocks Group plc, which the Group acquired during the year, has a defined benefit plan for the benefit of less than twenty Partners.
The plan is closed to new members and all benefits accruing to current members are frozen.
The Group recognises a liability in the financial statements representing the net obligation under the plan based on a valuation from an independent actuary which is updated at least annually.
Movements in the net obligation are credited charged to the income statement.
Full IAS19 defined benefit disclosures are not given because the defined benefit obligation, plan assets and net deficit are not material.
Leases Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life of the asset and the lease term.
The corresponding leasing commitments, net of finance charges, are included in liabilities.
Leasing payments are analysed between capital and interest components so that the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease at a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability outstanding.
All other leases are treated as operating leases with annual rentals, net of any incentives received, recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.
Certain of the Groups activities will also involve the sub-contracting of installation of works to third parties.
Revenue for sub-contracted installations is recognised on a principal basis as the Group ultimately retains the risks and rewards of these installations.
The Group generates revenue from three main sectors being: Managed Services formerly Government Contracts The Group acts as lead contractor and principal on a number of contracts.
These contracts will typically involve multiple revenue streams.
Revenue is generated from a combination of fixed and variable fees.
Revenue is based on the fair value of each revenue stream and is recognised when the Group is contractually entitled to recognise the revenue.
Installation Services Installation Services generates revenue from the installation of energy efficient measures such as central heating and insulation.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the number of energy efficient measures installed.
Specialist Support Services Specialist Support Services generates revenue from the provision of bespoke support services which are driven by the same market dynamics as other segments.
Revenue is recognised at the date of sale except if services are to be provided over future periods where the income is deferred and recognised over the relevant period.
Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group considers whether a contract contains an embedded derivative at inception.
Any embedded derivative is separated from the host contract where the associated economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract.
The Group has reviewed its contracts and has not identified any embedded derivatives.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is measured as the difference between the receivable's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the receivable's original effective interest rates.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
x71226 Rhouse back p2 cg:x71226 Rhouse back p2 cg 5 9 08 15:28 Page 10 43 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 eaga Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost and any difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Derivatives All derivatives are carried at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is not applied.
Redeemable preference shares Where redeemable preference shares exhibit the characteristics of a liability, they are recognised as a liability in the balance sheet, net of transaction costs.
The corresponding dividends on these shares are charged as interest expense in the income statement.
Fair valuation Fair values are based on market values where available.
fide-recognition of financial instruments A financial asset is fide-recognised when: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows.
A financial liability is fide-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are recorded using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The functional currency of the Groups foreign operations is the Canadian Dollar for eaga Canada Inc, Ark Solar Products Limited, Integrated Energy Systems Limited and Homeworks Services Inc and Indian Rupees for eaga Energy India Private Limited.
As at the balance sheet date, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange at that date and their income statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period.
The exchange differences arising on the translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On transition to IFRS, the translation reserve was set to zero as permitted under IFRS1.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of the original transaction.
Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate when the fair value was determined.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
Taxes Current tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities.
The tax rates used to compute the amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries or joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future x71226 Rhouse back p1 cg:x71226 Rhouse back p1 cg 4 9 08 10:29 Page 11 44 eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Deferred tax assets are recognised for all temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised Deferred tax is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged direct to equity in which case the deferred tax is also credited or charged to equity.
Share capital Ordinary and Preferred Ordinary Shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Exceptional items Exceptional items comprise items of income and expense that are material in amount and unlikely to recur and which merit separate disclosure in order to provide an understanding of the Groups underlying financial performance.
Examples of events giving rise to the disclosure of material items of income and expense as exceptional items include, but are not limited to, impairment events, disposals of operations or individual assets, litigation claims by or against the Group and the restructuring of components of the Groups operations.
Partnership bonus Prior to the Companys flotation on the London Stock Exchange on 7 June 2007, arrangements existed such that an annual partnership bonus was payable to all employees who were Qualifying Partners.
The partnership bonus was determined in relation to the results for the financial period and allocated to Qualifying Partners based on a percentage of pay.
An accrual for this bonus was included in the accounts for the relevant financial period based on the Directors estimate of the level payable.
This bonus structure ceased from the date of flotation.
Dividends Dividends paid on Ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are paid or approved by the Companys shareholders, whichever is earlier.
Self insurance The Group has access to a protected cell which is registered and operational in Guernsey.
The protected cell provides insurance cover against the costs incurred by the Group in relation to certain repairs of new or refurbished central heating systems installed under certain government contracts.
A liability, included within accruals and deferred income, is established based on the estimated costs of settling known and outstanding claims.
Share-based payments The Group allows employees to acquire shares of the Company through share option schemes, details of which are in the Remuneration Committee Report.
The fair value of share options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date, using an appropriate model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted, and is spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions In order to prepare these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the above accounting policies, management has used estimates and judgements to establish the amounts at which certain items are recorded.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements are those which have the greatest impact on the consolidated financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgements about matters that are inherently uncertain and are set out below.
Impairment of Goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating a value in use amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit and also to select a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Further details are given in note 13.
