Loss earnings per share Basic loss earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss profit for the year attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the ESOP Trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share in 2007, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being those share options granted to employees under a SAYE share option scheme and the contingently issuable shares under the LTIP schemes.
No dilution is applied in 2008 as the amount attributable to shareholders is a loss.
Underlying earnings are as defined in the Glossary.
Underlying earnings per share divides underlying earnings attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year as per the calculation for basic earnings per share.
