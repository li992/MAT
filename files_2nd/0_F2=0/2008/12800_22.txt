Financial statements continued Notes to the financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 23 August 2008 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements presented in this document have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments to fair value, and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
New standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC, becoming effective during the year, have not had a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand pounds, except where indicated.
New standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards, interpretations and amendments: Effective for the Group and the Company in these financial statements: Amendment to IAS 1 Capital Disclosure IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions The above new standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards have had no material impact on the results or the financial position of the Group or the Company for the 53 weeks ended 23 August 2008.

Basis of consolidation Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company Punch Taverns plc and all of its subsidiaries.
The Groups interests in its joint ventures are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment in value in the financial statements of the Company.
Investments in joint ventures are carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of accumulated profits less distributions received and less any impairment in value.
All intra-group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Where assets are transferred between segments, the goodwill attributable to these assets is also transferred.
Goodwill carried in the balance sheet is not amortised.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary acquired, the gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Operating leases and other intangible assets Operating leases and other intangible assets are capitalised at cost.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Operating leases Over the term of the lease Software 3 to 10 years Payments made on entering into or acquiring operating leases are accounted for as intangible assets and amortised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Property, plant and equipment Properties held at 22 August 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were revalued at that date and this revaluation is the deemed cost under IFRS.
Landlords fixtures and fittings include removable items, which are generally regarded as within landlord ownership.
These are depreciated in accordance with the policy detailed below.
Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less estimated residual values, by equal annual instalments as follows: Licensed properties, unlicensed properties and owner-occupied properties 50 years or the life of the lease if shorter Landlords fixtures and fittings, office furniture and fittings and motor vehicles 5 to 15 years Information technology equipment 3 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
An annual assessment of residual values is performed and there is no depreciable amount if residual values are the same as, or more than, book value.
Residual values are based on the estimated amount which would be currently obtainable from disposal of the asset net of disposal costs if the asset were already of the age and condition expected at the end of its useful life.
57 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 Financial statements Governance Business review Financial statements continued Notes to the financial statements continued for the 53 weeks ended 23 August 2008 1 Accounting policies continued Impairment Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
A review for indicators of impairment is performed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any impairment charge is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs.
When an impairment loss, other than an impairment loss on goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic resources as a result of past events.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
Provisions are discounted if the effect of the time value of money is material.
The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated taking account of any issue costs, and any discounts or premiums on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised, as well as through the amortisation process.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds, net of direct issue costs.
Convertible bonds On issue, the debt and equity components of convertible bonds are separated and recorded at fair value net of issue costs.
The fair value of the debt component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
This amount is classified as a liability and measured on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option and is recognised in equity, net of income tax effects.
The carrying amount of the equity component is not re-measured in subsequent years.
Taxation Income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable, based on taxable profits for the year, and deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or where the deferred tax asset or liability arises on an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Movements in deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement, except where they relate to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
For properties acquired as part of a business combination, movements in the deferred tax liability resulting from indexation allowance are taken to the income statement until the tax base cost plus indexation allowance reaches the fair value on acquisition, and directly to equity thereafter for historic revaluation surpluses.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Leasing Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
A corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Payments made on entering into or acquiring operating leases are accounted for as intangible assets and amortised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Pensions The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit arrangements is the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the present value of scheme liabilities.
Defined benefit scheme assets are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable by the Group.
The cost of providing benefits under the plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount within finance income or finance expense.
The cumulative net deficits on these defined benefit pension schemes have been recognised in full in equity at the date of transition to IFRS and subsequent actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full as they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The Group also contributes to money purchase pension plans for employees.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially accounted for and subsequently re-measured to fair value.
The fair value of the interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in forecast transactions.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled within finance costs in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement immediately.
The replacement or rollover of a hedging instrument into another hedging instrument is not an expiry, sale or termination where such replacement or rollover is part of the documented hedging strategy.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Changes in fair value of any derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
59 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 Financial statements Governance Business review Financial statements continued Notes to the financial statements continued for the 53 weeks ended 23 August 2008 1 Accounting policies continued Financial guarantee contracts Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognised at fair value.
Subsequent movements in fair values are recognised in the income statement.
Share-based payment transactions A number of employees of the Group including Directors receive an element of remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
Equity settled transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of shares is determined by the share price at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of share options is calculated by an external valuer based on a binomial model, a beta model or the Black-Scholes model, dependent upon the most appropriate valuation model for the individual scheme.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Punch Taverns plc market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of how many of the awards will eventually vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of the modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification to the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and VAT.
All operations take place solely in the United Kingdom.
Drink and food sales Revenue in respect of drink and food sales is recognised at the point at which the goods are provided, net of any discounts or volume rebates allowed.
Rents receivable Rents receivable are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Machine income The Groups share of net machine income is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amount.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Receivables are written off against the doubtful debt provision when management deems the debt to be no longer recoverable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Cash deposits held as security for the benefit of note holders are not classified as cash and cash equivalents.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost calculated on a first in first out basis and net realisable value.
com 1 Accounting policies continued Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale and completion should be expected within one year from the date of classification.
Dividend distribution Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups and the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Exceptional items In order to provide a trend measure of underlying performance, profit is presented excluding items which management consider will distort comparability, either due to their significant non-recurring nature or as a result of specific accounting treatments.
Further detail of the nature of exceptional costs is included in note 6.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgements including those relating to income taxes, deferred tax, financial instruments, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, valuations, provisions and post-employment benefits.
Management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and judgements that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are detailed below.
Goodwill impairment The Group assesses whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations require assumptions to be made regarding future cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
These assumptions are disclosed in note 13.
Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Recoverable amounts are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
Post-employment benefits The present value of defined benefit pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in note 32.
Any change in these assumptions could impact the carrying amounts of pension liabilities.
Authorisation of financial statements The Groups and Companys financial statements of Punch Taverns plc the Company for the period ended 23 August 2008 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 3 November 2008 and the balance sheets were signed on the Boards behalf by Giles Thorley and Phil Dutton.

The Group operates in two business segments: a leased estate and a managed estate.
Between 19 August 2007 and 23 August 2008, 20 pubs with a fair value of 14.1m have transferred from the managed to the leased estate.
The Group operates solely in the United Kingdom and therefore has only one geographical segment.

In the comparative period this represents the movement in property liabilities in respect of which the relevant statutory limitation period had expired credit of 27.9m and provision for rent payments following the reversion of eleven onerous leases to the Group charge of 6.4m.
2 Represents losses on impairment of property, plant and equipment and operating leases.
See note 13 for further detail.
3 Represents premiums in excess of the net book value of loans, borrowings and swap arrangements in relation to the redemption of the Avebury securitisation on 21 May 2007 and other refinancing.
4 Represents the movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Whilst the interest rate swaps are considered to be effective in matching the amortising profile of existing or planned floating rate borrowings, they do not meet the definition of an effective hedge due to the relative size of the mark to market difference of the swap at the date of acquisition or inception, and are categorised as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
5 Represents the recognition of losses previously not recognised and adjustments following the finalisation of prior year computations together with changes to tax base cost information in relation to property assets.
6 In the comparative period this represents the release of a provision following the finalisation of past tax matters.
7 In the comparative period a tax credit was recognised in the period following the enactment of legislation in July 2007 which lowered the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.

At 23 August 2008 the goodwill assigned to the leased estate is 368.6m August 2007: 364.6m and the goodwill assigned to the managed estate is 187.6m August 2007: 191.6m.
13 Impairment losses Property, plant and equipment and operating leases When any indicators of impairment are identified, fixed assets are reviewed for impairment based on each cash generating unit CGU.
The cash generating units are individual pubs.
The carrying values of these individual pubs was compared to the recoverable amount of the CGUs, which was based predominantly on value-in-use.
Value-in-use is calculated using five year financial forecasts.
Cash flows used in the value-in-use calculation are based on EBITDA less capital expenditure.
Beyond the initial five year period, cash flows are extrapolated using a nominal rate of 2.25% August 2007: 2.25% for the remaining useful life of the CGUs.
This rate is in line with the UKs post-war average growth rate and does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the market.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 8% August 2007: 8%.
com 13 Impairment losses continued Impairment losses have been recognised as follows: 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 23 August 2008 18 August 2007 Leased Managed Total Total m m m m Property, plant and equipment 153.3 123.1 276.4 Operating leases 1.5 16.8 18.3 154.8 139.9 294.7 The impairment recognised within the managed estate was primarily due to the reduction in profits experienced in the current financial period, being brought about by the change in the consumer market following the first full year of the smoking ban introduced in England and Wales, together with a weakened UK consumer environment.
The reduction in profits has subsequently impacted the value-in-use calculation.
The impairment has been recognised on pubs where their expected future cash flows has fallen to a level such that their value-in-use is below carrying value.
The impairment recognised within the leased estate was primarily due to the identification of 491 pubs considered unlikely to generate long-term sustainable growth following the change in the consumer environment following the first full year of the smoking ban in England and Wales.
These pubs are likely to be sold or converted for alternative use within the next few years and have been written down by 120m to their fair value less costs to sell, being managements best estimate of market value following consideration of past experience and the current market environment.
A further 35m of impairment has been recognised for pubs where their expected future cash flows has fallen to a level such that their value-in-use is below carrying value.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions At the point of the annual impairment review, the Group recognised a total impairment of 294.7m.
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at alternative use values, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
Key drivers to future growth rates are dependant on the Groups ability to maintain and grow drinks, rental and gaming machine profit streams in the leased business, whilst in the managed business, future growth rates are dependant on the ability to maintain and grow drinks, food and gaming machine profit streams whilst effectively managing pub operating costs.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used in the five year financial forecasts and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows: Impairment charge and reduction increase in net assets Leased Managed Total m m m Impact if discount rate was: increased by 1% 32.6 44.5 77.1 reduced by 1% 15.5 36.3 51.8 Impact if business plan growth rates were: increased by 1% in each of the next five years 5.6 11.4 17.0 decreased by 1% in each of the next five years 7.0 12.7 19.7 Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units CGUs based on the benefits to the group which arise from each business combination.
The two groups of CGUs are identified by their pub operating format leased or managed and this is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group.
The value of the goodwill was reviewed for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of the CGUs to the carrying value of their goodwill.
The recoverable amount of the CGUs was determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These value-in-use calculations use the same assumptions as for property, plant and equipment and operating leases.
Neither a 1% decrease in the growth rate in each of the next five years nor a 1% increase in the discount rate would have led to an impairment of goodwill in the current period.

Interest rate swaps The Group has taken out various interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans as follows: Punch Taverns Finance plc Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A3 N, Class B3, Class M2 N and Class D1 floating rate notes to a fixed rate of 5.954%.
The capital amount of these swaps reduces over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the floating rate notes.
Punch Taverns Finance B Limited Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A8 and Class C notes to a fixed rate of 5.1% and 4.7577% respectively.
Spirit Issuer plc Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 6.581% to March 2012 and 6.831% thereafter on the Class A1 and Class A2 debenture notes and, after their respective step-up dates, 4.555% on the Class A3, Class A4 and Class A5 debenture notes.
Although these swaps ensure that cash flows are perfectly hedged over the life of the notes they were deemed ineffective at the time of acquisition of the Spirit group, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 39, and accordingly all future movements in fair value will be recognised in the income statement.
Bank loans held by Punch Taverns plc Interest rate swap agreements were entered into which swapped the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 4.572% on the bank loans held by the Company.
The capital amount of these swaps reduced over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the bank loans.
On repayment of the loans during the period, the swap was terminated.
The interest rate exposure on the guaranteed loan notes is mitigated by the interest earned on the cash deposits used as guarantee.

The bonds mature five years from the issue date and can be redeemed at that date for 107.21% 294.8m of their principal amount or can be converted, at the option of the holder, into shares at an initial conversion price of 11.782.
The conversion price is subject to adjustment following capital distributions whether by cash dividend, dividend in specie, scrip dividend, capitalisation issue or otherwise.
The share price at the date of pricing of the convertible bonds in the market was 8.60.
The fair values of the liability component and equity component were determined at issuance of the bonds.
The fair value of the liability component was calculated using a market rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
The residual amount, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in shareholders equity as a separate reserve note 28.
The value of convertible bonds recognised in the balance sheet is calculated as follows: m Liability component at 19 August 2006 242.5 Finance cost note 5 22.7 Cash interest paid 13.7 Amortisation of deferred issue costs 1.6 Liability component at 18 August 2007 253.1 Finance cost note 5 23.9 Cash interest paid 13.8 Amortisation of deferred issue costs 1.6 Liability component at 23 August 2008 264.8 Finance cost on the bonds is calculated using the effective interest method by applying the effective interest rate of 9.23% August 2007: 9.23%.

Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Changes in fair value of any derivative financial instruments, that do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivative financial instruments, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, capital risk and credit risk.
There is no currency exposure as all material transactions and financial instruments are in sterling.
The Group has no material exposure to equity securities or commodity price risk and it is the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for each of these risks and they are summarised on pages 16 to 17.
com 22 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, the Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
Income and cash flows from cash and cash equivalents fluctuate with interest rates.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity shareholders funds, loan notes, bonds, and bank loans.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then employs derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The cash balances attract interest at floating rates.
Where over-hedging arises for example, due to early repayment of floating rate notes the Group will seek to eliminate the over-hedging, where this is financially practicable, either by embedding the cost in new swaps or by terminating the over-hedge.
The Group has taken out derivative financial instruments such that 99.7% of all loans at 23 August 2008 August 2007: 99.7% were either at fixed rate or were converted to fixed rate as a result of swap arrangements thereby largely eliminating the Groups exposure to changes in interest rates.
Cash flows associated with cash deposits, debt and interest rate swaps and the fair value of these instruments, fluctuate with changes in interest rates.
If the interest rates had been 1% higher or lower during the period, the effect on the income statement would be as follows: Movement in fair value Interest Interest of interest receivable payable rate swaps Period ended 23 August 2008 m m m Impact on income statement if interest rates increased by 1%: gain loss 2.2 74.9 Impact on income statement if interest rates decreased by 1%: gain loss 2.2 74.9 Impact on equity if interest rates increased by 1%: gain loss 108.6 Impact on equity if interest rates decreased by 1%: gain loss 108.6 Period ended 18 August 2007 Impact on income statement if interest rates increased by 1%: gain loss 3.3 54.9 Impact on income statement if interest rates decreased by 1%: gain loss 3.3 54.9 Impact on equity if interest rates increased by 1%: gain loss 128.8 Impact on equity if interest rates decreased by 1%: gain loss 128.8 Whilst cash flow interest rate risk is largely eliminated, the use of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk such that the Group would not benefit from falls in interest rates and would be exposed to unplanned costs should debt or derivative financial instruments be restructured or repaid early.
Liquidity risk The Groups funding strategy is to ensure a mix of financing methods offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
The Group is primarily financed by secured loan notes, with approximately 92% August 2007: 93% of the capital balance on these loan notes being repayable after more than five years from the balance sheet date, subject to relevant covenants being met.
The Board continues to review alternative sources of finance.
The Groups objective is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain a strong credit rating so maturing short term debt may be refinanced as it falls due.
Cash flow forecasts are frequently produced to assist management in identifying liquidity requirements.
This includes assessments of the ability to meet the restricted payment conditions in the three securitisation structures in order that cash can be released to the top company level.
Cash balances are invested in short term deposits such that they are readily available to settle short term liabilities or to fund capital additions.
Capital risk The Groups capital structure is made up of net debt, issued share capital and reserves.
These are managed effectively to minimise the Groups cost of capital, to add value to shareholders and to service debt obligations, ultimately ensuring that the Group continues as a going concern.
The Groups debt is divided into three separate securitisations and a convertible bond.
Although highly leveraged, the Group is able to generate sufficient returns to service the debt, and generate surplus funds that can be reinvested in the business, returned to shareholders, or used to reduce the cost of capital.
The securitised debt is monitored by a variety of measures, which are reported to the debt providers on a quarterly basis.
83 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 Financial statements Governance Business review Financial statements continued Notes to the financial statements continued for the 53 weeks ended 23 August 2008 22 Financial instruments continued Credit risk With the exception of cash and short term deposits invested with banks and financial institutions, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Groups objective is to minimise credit risk by ensuring that surplus funds are invested with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings and that the Group deals with third parties that have been subject to credit checks, or that have good credit scores, where appropriate.
The Group has taken out a number of interest rate swaps with financial institutions for the purpose of hedging its exposure to changes in interest rates.
As at the balance sheet date, only one of these instruments was held as a financial asset, valued at 1.4m.
Trade and other receivables, as shown on the Consolidated balance sheet, are shown net of a provision for doubtful debts, which management estimates based on a review of all individual receivable accounts, experience and known factors at the balance sheet date, taking into account any collateral held in the form of cash deposits, which is quantified.
These cash deposits are applied against unpaid debt when licensees leave the pubs, and vary in size.
The amount of cash deposits held at 23 August 2008 is 43.1m August 2007: 41.3m.
These are held on the balance sheet within trade and other payables.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables for doubtful debts is shown below: 23 August 18 August 2008 2007 m m Provision for doubtful debts at beginning of period 9.6 11.5 Charged to income statement 6.9 4.2 Utilised during the period 5.1 5.8 Released during the period 0.4 0.3 Provision for doubtful debts at end of period 11.0 9.6 The ageing of trade receivables at the balance sheet date, net of the doubtful debt provision, is as follows: 23 August 18 August 2008 2007 m m Live debt Current 43.5 52.8 0 35 days past due 2.6 2.3 Over 35 days past due 5.6 4.4 Closed debt 2.0 51.7 61.5 Live debt represents balances outstanding from current licensees.

Of the total carrying value of the interest rate swaps 106.1m August 2007: 49.5m qualify as, and are treated as, cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39 and movements in their fair values are recognised directly in equity.
The remaining 73.6m August 2007: 47.4m do not qualify for hedge accounting with movements in their fair value being recognised in the income statement.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the Groups secured loan notes and convertible bonds, there are no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Groups secured loan notes at 23 August 2008 is 4,710.6m August 2007: 4,754.4m and the fair value, measured at market value or the market value of equivalent listed loans, of this debt at that date is 4,087.2m August 2007: 4,808.2m.

SAYE scheme The first scheme is the savings related scheme which was open to all employees, whereby the proceeds from a Save As You Earn savings contract, of either three or five years duration, are used to exercise rights to acquire shares granted at the commencement of the savings contract at a discount of 20% to the market value of the shares at the date of grant.
Options may be exercised within six months of the maturity of the contract.
This scheme was introduced during the period ended 17 August 2002 with a further invitation to join during the period ended 23 August 2003.
There were no options granted under this scheme in the period ended 23 August 2008 or period ended 18 August 2007.
Discretionary Share Plan The second scheme is a Discretionary Share Plan DSP whereby options are granted to senior management over ordinary shares in the Company, at the prevailing market price at time of grant.
These options vest after a three year performance period, with performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee, and are then exercisable for a period of seven years.
Performance targets for options granted on 31 January 2006 and 16 November 2005 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth with 40% of options vesting on growth of RPI 8% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 10% per annum.
Performance targets for options granted on 17 November 2004 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth with 40% of options vesting on growth of RPI 8% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 12% per annum.
Performance targets for options granted on 2 March 2004 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth with 40% of options vesting on growth of RPI 12% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 15% per annum.

Eligible employees are awarded rights to the issue of a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made are satisfied.
Further information on the performance conditions of the Long Term Incentive Plan are shown in the Report on Directors remuneration on pages 34 to 46.
At 23 August 2008 eligible employees hold rights over ordinary shares which may result in the issue of 160,349 shares on 16 November 2008, 42,019 shares on 31 January 2009, 355,749 shares on 13 November 2009, 33,947 shares on 10 September 2010, 1,179,103 shares on 22 January 2011, 22,443 shares on 12 May 2011 and 295,202 shares on 7 July 2011.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan The fourth scheme is a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSB whereby senior management receive part of their post-tax annual bonus in shares.
These shares are held on behalf of the senior management in a trust and if certain performance and eligibility conditions are met then a further award of shares is made after three years.
Further information is provided in the Report on Directors remuneration on pages 34 to 46.
At 23 August 2008, 67,117 shares are held within the trust and eligible employees hold additional rights over ordinary shares that may result in the future issue of up to 18,549 shares on 10 November 2008, 24,767 shares on 13 November 2009 and 41,258 shares on 12 November 2010.
Share Incentive Plan The fifth scheme is a Share Incentive Plan SIP open to all eligible employees, whereby proceeds contributed by employees are used to buy shares in the Company at prevailing market values.
These shares are called Partnership Shares and are held in a trust on behalf of the employee.
For every Partnership Share bought by the employee the Company will give the employee one share free of charge Matching Share.
The employees have to take their shares out of the plan on leaving the Group and will not be entitled to the Matching Share if they leave within three years of buying the Partnership Shares.
If the Company awards dividends to its shareholders, the employee will receive a dividend on each of the Partnership and Matching Shares they hold.
The Company arranges for the dividends to be used to buy extra shares Dividend Shares.
Dividend Shares must be held in the plan for three years before they can be removed unless the employee leaves the Group in which case they must be taken out.
The scheme was introduced in June 2004 with shares being acquired at market values on an annual or monthly basis.
As at 23 August 2008 351,229 shares August 2007: 160,661 shares had been issued by the Company to the trust at par value.
The par value of the shares issued which has been deducted from reserves is negligible.
The market value of these shares at 23 August 2008 was 1.0m August 2007: 1.6m.
Fair value of share awards The fair value is measured using the valuation technique that is considered to be the most appropriate to value each class of award.
Discretionary Share Plan There were no awards made in relation to the Discretionary Share Plan during the current or the previous period.
Long Term Incentive Plan The key assumptions for awards made in the current and previous period are as follows: 7 July 12 May 22 January 10 September 13 November Grant date 2008 2008 2008 2007 2006 Monte Carlo Monte Carlo Monte Carlo Valuation model and binomial and binomial and binomial Monte Carlo Monte Carlo Share price at date of grant 2.80 6.06 6.22 10.23 11.42 Shares under option 295,202 22,443 1,187,439 33,947 527,874 Vesting period 3.0 years 3.0 years 2.8 years 3.0 years 3.0 years Expected volatility 34.65% 31.96% 27.47% 25.73% 22.44% Expected life 3.0 years 3.0 years 2.8 years 3.0 years 3.0 years Risk free rate 5.0666% 4.3995% 4.3524% 5.1022% 5.0176% Expected dividend yield 1.97% 1.68% 1.64% 0.50% 0.85% Expectation of meeting performance criteria 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Fair value per option 2.03 4.43 4.50 5.52 6.18 Expected volatility has been calculated based on the historic volatility of the Companys share price corresponding to the expected life of the option or share award.
com 26 Share-based payments continued The expected term of the options is based on the life to the point of expected exercise.
This is determined through analysis of historically evidenced exercise patterns of option holders.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
Share Incentive Plan The fair value of the Matching Shares issued under the Companys Share Incentive Plan is recognised as the market value of the shares issued at the date of purchase.
This charge is spread over the three year vesting period on a straight line basis.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan The estimated fair value of the deferred bonus shares awarded in the year are determined based on the market value of shares on the date of grant discounted by the expected dividend yield.
The estimated fair value of shares granted in the year, under this scheme, is shown below, together with the key assumptions: 12 November 13 November Grant date 2007 2006 Valuation model Binomial Black Scholes Share price at date of grant 9.36 11.42 Shares under option 43,629 36,742 Vesting period 3.0 years 3.0 years Expected volatility 24.59% 22.44% Expected life 3.0 years 3.0 years Risk free rate 4.7684% 5.0176% Expected dividend yield 0.55% 0.85% Expectation of meeting performance criteria 0% 0% Fair value per option 9.25 11.13 Movements in options and awards under share based payment schemes A reconciliation of movements for the SAYE, DSP, LTIP, DSB and SIP schemes over the 53 weeks to 23 August 2008 are shown below: SAYE scheme 53 weeks 53 weeks 52 weeks 52 weeks 23 August 23 August 18 August 18 August 2008 2008 2007 2007 1 1 No.
