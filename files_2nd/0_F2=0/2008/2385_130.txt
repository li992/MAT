The replacement cost pro t for the year is arrived at by excluding from pro t inventory holding gains and losses and their associated tax effect.
Inventory holding gains and losses, for this purpose, are calculated for all inventories except for those that are held as a part of a trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions.
BP uses this measure to assist investors in assessing BPs performance from period to period.
Replacement cost pro t is not a recognized GAAP measure.
b Effective 1 January 2008, replacement cost pro t for the year is determined by excluding from pro t inventory holding gains and losses as well as their associated tax effect.
Previously, replacement cost pro t excluded inventory holding gains and losses while the tax charge remained unadjusted and included the tax effect on inventory holding gains and losses.
Comparative amounts have been amended to the new basis and the impact of the change is shown in the table below.
There is no impact on pro t for the year.
