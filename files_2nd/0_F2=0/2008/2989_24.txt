This award is subject to the same Total Shareholder Return TSR performance targets as the original awards made in December 2006.
These performance targets are measured over an initial performance period to 4 June 2010 and a subsequent performance period to 4 June 2011.
The awards made under this plan in previous periods are subject to a mixture of Headline earnings per share see note 11 and TSR performance targets measured over a three or four year performance period.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

The summary above includes 0.6m 2007 1.1m options that were granted before 7 November 2002.
In accordance with IFRS2, no cost has been recognised in respect of these options.
e Fair value models: Nil cost options with internal performance targets are valued using the market price of a share at the date of grant, discounted for expected future dividends to the date of exercise.
The fair values of other options with internal performance targets are estimated at the date of grant using a Binomial model.
The inputs into the Binomial model are as follows: 2008 2007 Expected volatility % 29.2 28.6 Risk free rate % 5.8 5.3 Dividend yield % 2.0 2.0 Expected volatility has been arrived at by using the historical volatility of the Groups share price, and the volatility of the share price of similar companies, whose shares have been listed for longer than those of the Group, over a period comparable with the expected lives of the options.
The assumptions made in relation to the timing of exercises are based on historical exercise patterns for each option scheme.
The fair values of options with external performance targets are estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model.
The model combines the market price of a share at the date of grant with the probability of meeting performance criteria, based on the historical performance of the Groups shares.
The historical performance period reflects a volatility of 27.4%.
A dividend yield of 2.0% has been assumed in the model.

The principal differences between the total tax charge shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 30% to profit before taxation are as follows: 2008 2007 m m Profit before taxation 124.1 68.4 Profit before taxation at 30% 37.3 20.5 Items attracting no tax relief or liability 8.3 4.4 Income taxed at lower rates 19.7 12.8 Benefit of tax losses brought forward 4.0 4.5 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 20.2 5.8 Other timing differences not recognised in deferred tax 2.2 0.4 Impact of change in UK tax rate see below 2.6 Total tax charge 6.5 1.4 Tax on items recognised directly in reserves is as follows: 2008 2007 m m Current tax credit on share-based payments 8.4 7.8 Deferred tax debit on share-based payments 3.0 3.5 Deferred tax credit debit on available-for-sale investments 1.3 1.1 6.7 3.2 54 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 2008 Financial Statements 8 Taxation continued The major deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the period are as follows: Timing differences on Acquisition Share-based capitalised Other timing intangibles payments costs Tax losses differences Total m m m m m m At 1 April 2007 as previously stated 1.2 26.8 2.2 16.4 7.4 51.6 Adjustment to deferred tax on acquisition see note 14 10.3 10.3 At 1 April 2007 restated 1.2 26.8 2.2 16.4 17.7 61.9 Credit charge to income statement 1.2 0.2 9.0 29.5 19.0 2.9 Impact of change in UK tax rate 0.7 0.5 2.2 0.2 2.6 Credit charge to income statement 1.2 0.5 8.5 27.3 19.2 0.3 Charge credit to reserves 3.0 1.3 1.7 Exchange differences 0.5 0.5 Acquisition of subsidiaries 0.1 0.1 At 29 March 2008 0.1 23.3 6.3 44.2 0.2 60.9 No deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in either period, except where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.
From 1 April 2008, the UK statutory rate of corporation tax reduces from 30% to 28%.
The impact of this change on the value of deferred tax assets has been recognised at 29 March 2008.
At 29 March 2008, the Group had unused tax losses of 282.7m 2007 193.7m available for offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset of 44.2m 2007 16.4m has been recognised in respect of 141.9m 2007 56.8m of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining tax losses of 140.8m 2007 136.9m as there is insufficient evidence that there will be suitable taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered.
Included within the Groups unrecognised tax losses are amounts of 7.6m 2007 12.0m that will expire between 2014 and 2018 and 7.9m 2007 14.0m that will expire between 2008 and 2013.
All other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At 29 March 2008, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 45.9m 2007 26.1m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
As described in note 31, in May 2008 the Group announced that it proposes to sell 50% of the retail and distribution business to Best Buy Co. Inc.
This transaction may have a material impact on the recoverability of certain tax assets, the financial impact of which is currently uncertain.

In accordance with IFRS3 Business Combinations, prior period balances have been restated to reflect this.
A goodwill expense of 1.0m 2007 0.5m has been recognised in the period in relation to historical acquisitions.
Goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units CGUs which are generally based on geographical location.
The carrying amount of goodwill by geographical location is as follows: 2008 2007 m m UK Fixed Line 299.1 294.6 UK Distribution 39.3 34.0 France 95.5 88.6 Germany 82.9 71.1 Spain 68.8 45.6 Other 91.9 92.6 Total goodwill 677.5 626.5 57 www.
com Notes to the Financial Statements continued 12 Goodwill and other intangible fixed assets continued The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following 15 years based on a country-specific growth rate ranging from 1.6% to 2.3%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The average pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10.0%.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period, all of which are based on historical patterns and expectations of future market developments.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The Directors have not identified any CGUs where it is considered likely that key assumptions may change to such an extent that it would lead to a significant impairment loss.

The valuation of customer bases is derived from the discounted future cash flows expected from them, after a deduction for contributory assets.
Customer revenue share agreements again arose on the acquisition of AOLs UK internet access business, and represent rights, subject to performance criteria, to a share of transactional revenues generated by AOL access and TalkTalk customers on AOL sites.
The valuation of these rights was again derived from the discounted future cash flows expected from the agreement, after a deduction for contributory assets.
Other acquisition intangibles represent a licence to continue to use the AOL brand for a limited time period, valued using the relief from royalty method.
