Key Performance Indicators The Report of the Directors includes a number of measures that management uses as key performance indicators.
Underlying growth in revenue is not presented in the accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS and is therefore not a Generally Accepted AccountingPrinciple non-GAAP measure.
The principalkey performance indicatorspresented intheAnnualReport are: Underlying growth in revenue Underlying growth in revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure which is a key performance indicator used by the Groups management in order to compare the revenue in a given year to that of the previous year on a like-for-like basis.
This is achieved by adjusting for the impact both of sales of products acquired in business .
The Group believes that the tabular presentation and  tounderlying assists investors intheir assessment of the Groups performance ineach business segment and for the Group as awhole.
Underlying growth in revenue is considered by the Group to be an important measure of performance in terms of local functional currency since it excludes those items considered to be outside the influence of local management.
The Groups management uses this non-GAAP measure in its internal financial reporting, budgeting and planning to assess performance on both a business segment and a consolidated Group basis.
Revenue growth at constant currency is important in measuring business performance compared to competitors and compared to the growth of the market itself.
The Groups annual bonus incentive plans include an element which relates to revenue growth performance.
Targets are set and performance measured in constant currency .
The Group considers that the revenue from sales of products acquired in business combinations results in a step-up in growth in revenue in the year of acquisition that cannot be wholly attributed to local managements efforts with respect to the business inthe year of acquisition.
 usually be a further step change in the following year.
A measure of growth excluding the effects of business combinations also allows senior management to evaluate the performance and relative impact of growth from the existing business and growth from acquisitions.
The process of making business acquisitions is directed, approved  objectives.
i The material limitation of the underlying growth in revenue measure is that it excludes certain factors, described on page i, which ultimately have a significant impact on total revenues.
The Group compensates for this limitation by taking into account relative movements in exchange rates in its investment, strategic planning and resource allocation.
In addition, as the evaluation and assessment of business acquisitions is not within the control of local management, performance of acquisitions is monitored centrally until the business is integrated.
The Groups management considers that both the non-GAAP measure of underlying growth in revenue and the GAAP measure of growth in revenue are complementary measures neither of which management use exclusively.
Basic adjusted earnings per ordinary share EPSA, trading profit and adjusted attributable profit Growth in EPSA and trading profit are measures which present the trend growth in the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions or events that management considers affect the Groups short-term profitability.
The Group presents these measures to assist investors in their understanding of trends.
EPSA growth and trading profit are also the key measures used for remunerating senior management in order to align the interests of senior management with those of investors.
The Groups internal financial reporting budgets, monthly reporting, forecasts, long-term planning and incentive plans, focuses primarily on profit and earningsbefore these items.
The Group has identified the following items, where material, as those to be adjusted and identified separately: acquisition and disposal related items including amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangible assets: significant restructuring events: gains and losses arising from legal disputes and uninsured losses: and taxation thereon.
A reconciliation of attributable profit to adjusted attributable profit, which represents the numerator used in the EPSA calculation, is presented in Selected Financial Data on page 155.
An explanation of how trading   28.
EPSA and trading profit are not recognisedmeasures under IFRS.
The  measures isthat they exclude significant income and costs that have a direct impact on current and prior years profit attributable to shareholders.
They do not, therefore, measure the overall performance of the Group presented by the GAAP measures of earnings per share and operating profit.
The Group considers that no single measure enables it to assess overall performance and therefore it compensates for the limitation of the adjusted earnings per share and trading profit measures by considering them in conjunction with their GAAP equivalents.
Gains or losses which are identified separately arise from irregular events or transactions.
Such events or transactions are authorised centrally and require a strategic assessment which includes consideration of financial returns and generation of shareholder value.
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles will occur each year, whilst other excluded items  that giverisetosuchitems.
