Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts 1985, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in December 2005.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The Company has adopted FRS 29: Financial Instruments: Disclosures for the first time in these accounts.
FRS 29 introduces new disclosure requirements relating to financial instruments.
This standard does not have any impact on the classification and or valuation of the Companys financial instruments.
The disclosures required by this standard are given in notes 19 and 20 on pages 38 to 44. b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from the total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with documented investment strategy and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to an acquisition which are written off to the capital column of the income statement at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which for listed investments are bid market prices.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains or losses on disposal are included in the income statement within Gains losses from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Gains or losses on the realisation of investments and realised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the realised capital reserve.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the unrealised capital reserve.
Transaction costs incurred on the purchase and sale of investments are also included within this caption.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is taken to capital.
Overseas dividends are shown gross of withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Deposit interest receivable and stock lending income are taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue with the exception of expenses incidental to the purchase and sale of investments which are charged to capital.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise mainly brokerage commission.
In accordance with the SORP, disclosure of transaction costs is required and can be found in note 10. e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an effective interest rate basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25: Financial instruments: Presentation and FRS 26: Financial instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated wholly to revenue.

Other receivables and payables do not carry any interest and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
Gains and losses on investments arising from a change in exchange rates are included in gains from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
h Taxation Deferred taxation is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred taxation assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
i VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
The basis on which it has been calculated is the partial exemption method using the proportion of taxable supplies to non taxable supplies.
Further information regarding VAT on management fees is given in note 4 on page 32.

The Company ceased paying VAT on management fees with effect from 1st October 2007 and has recovered VAT suffered in respect of the period from 20th December 2002 to 30th September 2007.

This has arisen from deductible expenses exceeding taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the features page inside the front cover.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Company's net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise the following: investments in Russian equity shares and a US$ liquidity fund which are both held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: a US$ loan facility with ING Bank: and derivative transactions including written call options and short term forward currency contracts for the purpose of settling short term liabilities.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowing may be used to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
This borrowing would be limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31st October are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of profit after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and assumes a 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the US$, Rouble and the other currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is deemed a reasonable illustration based on the volatililty of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened this would have had the following effect:- 2008 2007 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 948 731 Capital return 938 2,051 Total return after taxation for the year 1,886 1,320 Net assets 1,886 1,320 40 JPMorgan Russian Securities plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Accounts continued 19.

ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits, investments in liquidity funds and the interest payable on the Companys variable rate cash borrowings.
Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings are used when required.
The Company may finance part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
The possible effects on cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when the Company borrows on the loan facility.
However, amounts drawn down on this facility are for short term periods and therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not significant.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below.
2008 2007 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates JPM US Dollar Liquidity Fund 10,565 17,676 Cash at bank 177 17,553 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Borrowings on the loan facility 33,697 Total exposure 10,742 1,532 The target interest earned on the JPM US Dollar Liquidity Fund is the 7 day US Dollar London Interbank Bid Rate.
Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR.
During the year, the Company renegotiated its credit facility agreement with ING Bank.
Under the terms of the amended agreement, the Company may draw down US$35 million at an interest rate of US$ LIBOR, as offered in the market for the relevant period, plus a margin of 0.7% per annum plus the 'mandatory costs' rate, which is the cost of complying with certain regulatory requirements.
This facility has been utilised during the year but was undrawn at the year end.
At 31st October 2007, the Company had drawn down US$70 million on the facility with ING Bank at an interest rate of 5.82% repayable on 5th November 2007.

This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

During the year, the Companys net balance of monetary financial assets, comprising cash plus liquidity funds less loans, fluctuated between 1.5million and 87.0 million as shown above.
During the comparative year the exposure ranged between net cash and liquidity fund balances of 23.6 million and net loan balances of 19.7 million.
iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued iii Other price risk continued Other price risk exposure The Company's exposure to changes in market prices at 31st October comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Equity investments at fair value through profit or loss 132,743 424,128 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 10 to 12.
The equity portfolio comprises entirely Russian companies.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However, it should be noted that an investment may not be wholly exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% in the fair value of the Companys equities.

Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and to maximise capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate level of gearing.
The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 90% to 115%.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as investments excluding holdings in liquidity funds, expressed as a percentage of shareholders funds.
2008 2007 000 000 Investments excluding liquidity fund holdings 132,743 424,128 Shareholders funds 142,658 403,514 Gearing 93.0% 105.1% The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: and the need for issues of new shares, including issues from Treasury.
Post balance sheet event Subsequent to the year end there have been significant fluctuations in company share prices in stockmarkets around the world, including Russia.
As a result the Companys NAV has dropped 33.4% from 255.1 pence per share at 31st October 2008 to 170.0p pence per share at 3rd February 2009.
