Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting Policies A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year and with the proceeding year, are set out below.
a Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting practice UK GAAP and the AICs Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued in January 2009. b Investments The Companys investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as the Companys business is to invest in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of capital growth and income.
Quoted investments are valued at their fair value which is represented by the bid price.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
As investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the capital return for the period and transaction costs on acquisition or disposal of a security are expensed to the capital reserve.
Purchases and sales of investments are accounted for on trade date.
c Income Dividends receivable on quoted equity shares are brought into account on the ex-dividend date.
Dividend income is shown excluding any related tax credit.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Other income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged to revenue except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition and disposal of an investment are charged to capital: and expenses are charged to capital reserve where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 62.5% to capital reserve and 37.5% to revenue reserve, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Finance costs of debt, insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, are allocated 62.5% to capital reserve and 37.5% to revenue account, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
f Capital reserve The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year-end.
gains on the return of capital by way of investee companies paying special dividends: and expenses, together with the related taxation effect, charged to this reserve in accordance with the above policies.
40 Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting Policies continued g Special reserve This reserve may be treated as distributable profits for all purposes, excluding the payment of dividends.
The cost of purchasing Ordinary Shares for cancellation is accounted for in this reserve.
h Capital redemption reserve The nominal value of Ordinary Shares bought back for cancellation is added to this reserve.
i Taxation The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between revenue and capital on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates, under the marginal method, using the Companys effective rate of tax for the accounting period.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date measured on an undiscounted basis and based on enacted tax rates.
This is subject to deferred tax assets being recognised only if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.

The main covenant under the facility requires that, on 31 December each year, total creditors including amounts due under this facility shall not exceed 50% of the Companys investments.
As at 31 December 2008, total creditors represented 9.2% of the Companys investments.

Bank debt facilities are utilised when the Managers believe it is in the interest of the Company to financially gear the portfolio.
Note 1 sets out the accounting policies, including criteria for recognition and the basis of measurement applied for significant financial instruments excluding cash at bank which is carried at fair value.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
The main risks that the Company faces arising from its financial instruments are: i interest rate risk, being the risk that the interest receivable payable and the market value of investment holdings may fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates: and ii liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty raising funds to meet its cash commitments as they fall due.
Liquidity risk may result from either the inability to sell financial instruments quickly at their fair values or from the inability to generate cash inflows as required: iii credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company: and iv market price risk, being the risk that the market value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency rate movement.
The Companys financial instruments are all denominated in sterling and therefore the Company is not directly exposed to any significant currency risk.
However, it is recognised that most investee companies, whilst listed in the UK, will be exposed to global economic conditions and currency fluctuations.
i Interest rate risk When the Company decides to hold cash balances, all balances are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding rates of interest linked to bank base rate which at 31 December 2008 was 2% 2007: 5.5%.
The Companys policy is to hold cash in variable rate bank accounts and not usually to invest in fixed rate securities.
The Companys investment portfolio is not directly exposed to interest rate risk.
The Company has a bank debt facility of 80,000,000 of which 41,174,000 was utilised as at 31 December 2008 2007: debt facility of 80,000,000, none of which was utilised as at 31 December 2007.
Further details of this facility can be found in Note 11.
If the bank base rate had increased by 1%, the impact on the profit or loss would have been a negative 412,000 2007: positive 180,000.
If the bank base rate had decreased by 1%, the impact on the profit or loss would have been a positive 412,000 2007: negative 180,000.
The calculations are based on the cash balances as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole and assume all other variables remain constant.
48 Notes to the Accounts 17 Financial instruments continued ii Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable equity securities which, if necessary, can be sold to meet any funding requirements though short term funding flexibility can typically be achieved through the use of bank debt facilities.
The Companys current liabilities all have a remaining contractual maturity of less than three months with the exception of the Bank of Scotland facility.
Further details of this facility can be found in Note 11. iii Credit risk The Company invests in UK equities traded on the London Stock Exchange and investment transactions are carried out with a large number of FSA regulated brokers with trades typically undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis and on a short settlement period.
Cash at bank is held with reputable banks with acceptable external credit ratings.
The investment portfolio assets of the Company are held by The Northern Trust Company, the Companys custodian, in a segregated account.
In the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of Northern Trust the Companys rights with respect to the securities held by the custodian may be delayed or limited.
The Board monitors the Companys risk by reviewing Northern Trusts internal control report.
iv Market price risk The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations which are monitored by the investment managers in pursuance of the investment objective.
No derivative or hedging instruments are currently utilised to specifically manage market price risk.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in the Managers Report on pages 7 to 12.
It is not the Managers policy to use derivatives to manage portfolio risk.
If the investment portfolio valuation fell by 20% at 31 December 2008, the impact on the profit or loss would have been negative 92.9m 2007: negative 142.0m.
If the investment portfolio valuation rose by 20% at 31 December 2008, the impact on the profit or loss would have been positive 92.9m 2007: 142.0m.
The calculations are based on the portfolio valuation as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole and assume all other variables remain constant.
As at 31 December 2008, all of the Companys financial instruments were included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The book value and fair value were the same.
The investment portfolio consisted of listed investments valued at their bid price, which represents fair value.
Any cash balances, which are held in variable rate bank accounts, can be withdrawn on demand with no penalty.

This is achieved through the appropriate balance of equity capital and gearing.
Further details can be found in the Business Review.
18 Contingencies, guarantees, financial commitments and contingent assets The Company had no contingencies, guarantees or financial commitments as at 31 December 2008 2007: nil.
The Company may be able to recover further amounts of VAT charged on investment management fees in respect of the period from 1997 to 2000.
However, the Board considers that currently there are too many uncertainties to recognise any amounts potentially recoverable from HM Revenue & Customs.
