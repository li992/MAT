Notes to the Group Accounts continued 8 Pension schemes The funding of the United Kingdom defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The pension costs for the year ended 31 March 2008 amounted to 3.5m 2007: 5.2m.
The contributions paid by the Group to the defined contribution section of the scheme amounted to 4.0m 2007: 2.2m.
The rules of the UK Electrocomponents Group Pension Scheme give the Trustee powers to wind up the scheme, which it may exercise if the Trustee is aware that the assets of the Scheme are insufficient to meet its liabilities.
Although the Scheme is currently in deficit, the Trustee and the Company have agreed a plan to eliminate the deficit over time and the Trustee has confirmed that it has no current intention of exercising its power to wind up the Scheme.
In addition to the UK scheme outlined above there are certain pension benefits provided on a defined benefit basis in Germany and Ireland amounting to 1.1m 2007: 1.1m, defined contribution basis in Australia and North America amounting to 1.0m 2007: 0.9m, and via government schemes in France, Italy, Scandinavia and North Asia amounting to 2.6m 2007: 2.4m.
The Group expects to pay 5.1m to its UK defined benefit pension plan in 2009 dependant upon the consultation referred to below.
As part of the formal triennial valuation of the United Kingdom defined benefit pension scheme at 31 March 2007, which has been agreed in principle with the Trustee of the scheme, the Group considered the prospective future cost and volatility of the UK defined benefit scheme structure.
This has led to the Group concluding a consultation, on 3 April 2008, with the membership of the scheme over a number of proposed changes.
These changes are designed to reduce the cost and volatility of maintaining the UK defined benefit scheme going forwards and are intended to apply from June 2008.
