The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value in use calculations.
Those calculations use cash flow projections based on actual operating results and management projections for a further six years.
Cash flows for further periods are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2% 2007: 2% which is appropriate for the long-term nature of the business.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9% 2007: 9% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
A period of more than five years has been used as the Directors believe this is a reasonable assumption based on the fact that the investments are all held for the long term.
For periods after five years, the use of extrapolations from earlier budgets and forecasts, after assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions, by examining the causes of differences between past cash flow projections and actual cash flows has been used.
The key assumptions used is the sales growth rate.
This is based upon historical growth rates and future plans in the medium-term.
Long-term growth rates are based upon expected GDP growth, in line with IAS 36: Impairment of Assets, rather than management expectations.
The recoverable amount of the unit exceeds its carrying value and the carrying value of the goodwill is therefore not impaired.
