annual report and accounts 2008 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 continued 27 Share-based payment plans The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans as follows: i Share options Options are granted with a fixed exercise price at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Awards are granted to Directors and employees on a merit basis, and are subject to continuous employment.
Options granted become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, and are valued using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
For comparative purposes, all share prices reflected below are stated on an Xchanging plc equivalent basis.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: General assumptions Vesting period years 3 Option life years 10 Expected life years 3.25 Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield % 1 Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting % 20 Risk-free interest rate % 3.8 4.7 2008 2007 Weighted average share price at grant date pence 272.24 143.04 Weighted average exercise price pence approved options 246.75 135.07 unapproved options 274.14 146.32 Weighted average fair value of options granted in the period pence approved options 59.00 30.57 unapproved options 62.22 33.04 Expected volatility % 27 28 24 26 There were no grants of options over G shares during 2008 or 2007.
As limited historical volatility exists for Xchanging, the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies over the last three years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
A reconciliation of option movements over the year to 31 December 2008 is in note 26.
The weighted average share price during the year for options exercised over the year was 2.46 per share 2007: 2.86.
The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payments under the share option plans was 548,000 2007: 622,000, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
106,000 of the 2007 charge was classified as exceptional as it related to accelerated charges due to early exercises as a result of the IPO.
indd 36 31 03 2009 09:50:34 Financial statements and information annual report and accounts 2008 27 Share-based payment plans continued ii Performance Share Plan PSP Awards have been granted under the Performance Share Plan to Executive Directors and certain members of Xchangings management group.
Under the terms of the scheme, conditional awards of shares are granted, which will vest at the end of the three year performance period.
Both basic and stretch awards have been granted, the proportion of each award that will vest is dependent on the performance of the Companys total shareholder return TSR as compared with the performance of its comparator group defined as the constituents of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts and on the attainment of an EPS growth underpin.
25% of the basic awards will vest if TSR is at a median position and 100% if TSR is in the upper quartile.
In between these positions, the basic award will vest on a straight-line basis.
The stretch award will also vest on a straight-line basis, with 0% vesting if TSR is at an upper quartile position, up to 100% if TSR is in the top decile.
The EPS underpin is the UK RPI plus 3%.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the awards in cash.
Awards are granted to Directors and employees on a merit basis, and are subject to continuous employment over the length of the vesting period.
Awards granted vest three years from the date of the award and are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The Monte Carlo simulation model used for valuing PSP awards with a TSR performance condition requires additional assumptions.
A single co-efficient assumption of 32% based on historical analysis has been used in the current year, representing the level of correlation of growth in TSR between the comparator companies simulated in the model.
The three year historical volatility for each company in the comparator group at grant date has been analysed and this historical volatility has been used in the model to project TSR for each company.
As limited historical volatility exists for Xchanging, the expected volatility for the Group is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies over the last three years.
The fair value per award granted and the assumptions used as inputs into the model are as follows: General assumptions Vesting period years 3.00 3.14 Expected life years 3.00 3.14 Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield % 1 Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting % 20 Expected volatility % 28 Risk-free interest rate % 4.02 4.05 Weighted average share price at grant date 2.59 Weighted average fair value at grant date 1.36 Movements during 2008 awards granted 5,186,288 awards forfeited 194,254 At 31 December 2008 4,992,034 The total charge for the year relating to the PSP, including social security on the awards, is 1,765,000 2007: nil.
iii Share Purchase Plan 2007 SPP The Group adopted the SPP during 2007, in which Executive Directors and certain members of senior management were invited to participate.
Under this scheme, set up in February 2007, an employee benefit trust loaned money to the participants in order to allow them to purchase class F shares in Xchanging BV at the market value at the time of 5.30 Xchanging plc equivalent value 1.33.
These loans are non-interest bearing and the terms and conditions are described further in note 38.
Participants may not normally sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares awarded under the scheme for a period of 18 months from issue.
Shares may now be sold on the condition that a pro rata proportion of any loan from the employee benefit trust is repaid.
As the shares were granted at the fair market value at the time there is no share-based payment charge as a result of this scheme.
The share awards are subject to continued employment for a period of 18 months from the date of grant although the employee benefit trust may repurchase any shares awarded at the current market value for good leavers.
