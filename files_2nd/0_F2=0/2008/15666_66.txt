Specically, while the Company generates revenues in numerous 2 Canadian tax losses are first offset by deferred tax liabilities not related to indefinite jurisdictions, the tax provision on earnings is computed after lived intangible assets before computing the required valuation allowance.
The deferred tax liability decreased in 2008 increased in 2007 from the revaluation taking account of intercompany interest and other charges of debt and currency swaps.

from the various jurisdictions in which operations, technology and content assets are owned.
For these reasons, the effective tax rate differs substantially from the Canadian corporate tax rate.
The Companys effective tax rate and its cash tax cost depend on the laws of numerous countries and the provisions of multiple income tax conventions between various countries in which the Company operates.
At December 31, 2008, the Company had Canadian tax losses carried forward of $1,802 million, tax losses carried forward in other jurisdictions of $1,797 million, and U. S. state tax losses carried forward which, at current U. S. state rates, have an estimated value of $23 million.
If not utilized, the majority of the Canadian tax losses carried forward will expire between 2009 and 2038, while the U. S. state tax losses carried forward expire between 2009 and 2028.
The majority of the tax losses in other jurisdictions may be carried forward indefinitely.
The ability to realize the tax benets of these losses is dependent upon a number of factors, including the future profitability of operations in the jurisdictions in which the tax losses arose.
Additionally, the Company has $2,595 million of capital losses carried forward, which may only be used to offset future capital gains, and against which the Company has provided a full valuation allowance.
