Financial statements 71 Notes to the accounts Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and business segment.
A summary of the 2008 goodwill allocation by business segment is shown below: North Asia 2008 2007 UK Europe America Pacific Africa Total Total m m m m m m m Textiles and Washroom Services 8.6 75.3 28.4 112.3 101.3 Pest Control 17.5 66.5 40.3 124.3 90.8 Ambius 3.1 14.2 4.5 0.2 22.0 16.2 City Link 203.1 203.1 201.3 Facilities Services 13.6 11.0 24.6 21.2 31 December 2008 225.3 95.9 80.7 84.2 0.2 486.3 31 December 2007 224.3 81.2 57.1 68.0 0.2 430.8 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and long-range plans approved by management covering a five-year period which are prepared as part of the groups normal planning process.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates.
The key assumptions used by individual CGUs for value-in-use calculations were long-term growth rates of between 0% and 2% and pre-tax discount rates of between 12% and 18% 2007: 11% and 14%.
The growth rates used by individual CGUs are based on the long-term growth rates predicted for the relevant sector and country in which a business operates.
They do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that industry or country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the relevant sector and country.
During the year an impairment charge of 14.4m in respect of current and prior years acquisitions was made in the year.
The charge related to Technivap 6.9m and Delcol 5.6m in the Facilities Service segment and Envirofresh 1.9m in Textiles and Washrooms segment.
The impairments arose due to deteriorating trading conditions within these businesses.
The remaining goodwill balance at 31 December 2008 amounts to 486.3m with 203.1m of this relating to the acquisition of the City Link Franchisees and Target Express in previous years.
The most significant assumption surrounding the recoverability of this goodwill balance relates to the future cash flows of the enlarged City Link business and the extent of the success of the initiatives being implemented to return this business to profitability.
The impairment test assumes operating cash inflows in 2013 of some 30m with future years growing at rates consistent with the longer-term growth rates disclosed above.
These cash flows would need to be approximately 25% below these levels before goodwill is impaired.
The remaining balance of 283.2m is spread across a number of CGUs and no reasonable change in the key assumptions above would give rise to a significant impairment in these businesses.

As a matter of policy, all outstanding trade balances greater than 12 months are fully provided except as approved by senior management and with due regard to the historical risk profile of the customer.
There were no new customers in 2008 where the group considered there was a risk of significant credit default.
There are no trade receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated.

There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges.
The group has 300m fixed to floating LIBOR plus spread interest rate swaps for which hedge accounting is applied and whose critical terms match those of the bonds disclosed in note 21.
The group has outstanding forward rate agreements maturing in between 3 to 13 months with nominal values of 300m and $240m attracting average fixed interest rate of 4.92% and 3.13% respectively.
The GBP forward rate agreements are cash flow hedge accounted while the USD forward rate agreements are non hedge accounted.
A charge of 4.2m 2007: nil has been recognised in reserves during the year in respect of the forward rate agreements which are cash flow hedge accounted.

Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments together with other outgoings, after taking into account existing sub-tenant arrangements and assumptions relating to later periods of vacancy.
Environmental The group owns a number of properties in the UK, Europe and the USA where there is land contamination and provisions are held for the remediation of such contamination.
These provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next ten years.
Self-insurance The group purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks in order to limit the maximum potential loss that could be suffered in any one year.
Individual claims are met in full by the group up to agreed self-insured limits in order to limit volatility in claims.
During the later part of 2008, the group purchased external insurance to replace some of the previously self-insured risks.
Provision is still held for selfinsured past cover.
The calculated cost of self-insurance claims, based on an actuarial assessment of claims incurred at the balance sheet date, is accumulated as claims provisions.
Other Other provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising, warranties given and costs relating to disposed businesses together with amounts set aside to cover certain legal and regulatory claims.
These provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next five years.
The above provisions have been discounted where appropriate using a discount rate of 3.0% 2007: 3.2% for the UK and 2.1% 2007: 2.2% for the USA.

Due to the issues experienced at City Link in 2008 and the subsequent underperformance of sterling cash flows, there has been a switch away from sterling debt toward euro and dollar denominated debt.
The mix of the groups debt and various notes are shown below.

In September 2008, 75m was raised through the issue of 25-year Floating Rate Reset Notes.
From issue until August 2013 the Reset Notes will bear interest at three-month LIBOR 3.98%.
Thereafter the interest rate will be 4.55% plus a credit spread which will be reset every two years by auction.
Noteholders may put the Reset Notes back to the issuer, at par, in August 2013 and on each biennial interest reset date thereafter.
The group may call the Reset Notes at fair market value on interest payment dates from August 2011.
If not put or called, the Reset Notes will mature in August 2033.
In October 2008, 50m was raised through the issue of Floating Rate Notes due 2013.
The effective interest rates on the 300m, 75m, 50m and 500m notes are 5.82%, 8.13%, 6.33% and 5.00% respectively.
The floating rate bonds are not designated as hedges in accordance with IAS 39 and are carried on the balance sheet at amortised cost.
The interest rate swap a derivative related to the 300m note is fair valued at the period end date.
Floating rate loans bear interest at rates, based on the relevant national borrowing rate benchmark equivalents e. g. LIBOR, which are fixed in advance usually for periods of between one and 12 months.
The group has no significant fixed rate debt except for the fixed rate bonds disclosed above.
The 300m bond is designated in a fair value hedge which converts the bond to floating interest rates.
The 500m bond is designated for net investment hedging.
The floating rate exposure is managed using forward rate agreements which all mature within one year, except for a contract with a nominal value of $240m which matures within 13 months.
Other borrowings represent bank loans and overdrafts and are held at amortised cost.
Fair value hedge accounting has been applied to all the notes and related derivatives marked as FV fair value hedge in accordance with IAS 39.
The related derivative and the hedged note are both fair valued and the ineffective portion of the hedge is taken directly to finance costs.
Where no hedge accounting has been applied, all the notes and related derivatives have been marked as NH non-hedge and any changes are taken to finance costs.
The fair value of current bank and other borrowings equals their carrying amount as the impact of discounting is not significant.
The fair value and carrying amount of non-current bank and other borrowings are shown in the table below.

Net investment hedging The group has designated the 500m note as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the eurozone.
The fair value of the euro note at 31 December 2008 was 487.7m 2007: 359.6m.
The group has entered into foreign currency swaps to convert Euro and USD debt into synthetic GBP debt.
These swaps achieve hedge accounting and are accounted for as net investment hedges.
They had a fair value as at 31 December 2008 of 0.3m with a maturity of between one and sixteen months.
The foreign exchange loss of 103.2m 2007: 2.5m loss on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in exchange reserves.
Where net investment hedging has been applied to the medium term notes, the related note has been marked with a NIH.

Foreign currency risk The group uses debt denominated in foreign currencies to provide either a natural offset in the income statement of the translation of foreign currency assets or to designate borrowings and foreign exchange forward agreements as net investment hedges of the foreign currency assets of subsidiaries, with translation gains or losses taken to equity.
Similarly, the groups businesses do not undertake significant cross border trade and therefore are not subject to significant foreign currency transaction risk.
Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities including letters of credit of 45.7m 2007: 44.9m available at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 in respect of which all continuing conditions precedent had been met at that date.

Retirement benefit obligations Apart from the legally required social security state schemes, the group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The major schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The principal scheme in the group is the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme RIPS in the United Kingdom, which has a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new entrants other than the Initial No 2 Section, accounting for 0.5% of the total schemes liabilities, which remains open.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are usually carried out every three years.
The most recent full valuation was at 31 March 2007.
These defined benefit schemes are reappraised annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19 requirements.
The principal assumptions used for the UK RIPS scheme are shown below.
2008 2007 Weighted average % Discount rate 6.4% 6.0% Expected return on plan assets 6.0% 6.1% Future salary increases 3.7% 4.1% Future pension increases 2.9% 3.4% The expected return on plan assets in the above table is a long-term rate of return.
Assets with higher historic volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the expected return for each asset class over the benchmark asset allocation for the scheme at 31 December 2008, less an appropriate allowance for the cost of maintaining the swap portfolio.
Mortality assumptions At 31 December 2008, standard tables PNMA00 and PNFA00 projected based on the year of the members birth using the PA92 series Medium Cohort projection factors incorporating underpins to annual improvements in mortality rates of 1.0% for males and 0.5% for females.
The mortality rates are scaled by a factor of 130% for non-executive members and by 85% for executive members.
This equates to a man aged 65 living for a further 20.0 years if he is a non-executive member and for a further 23.5 years if he is an executive member.
The corresponding figures for a woman are 22.1 and 26.0 years respectively.
At 31 December 2007, standard tables PMA92 and PFA92 projected using the Medium Cohort projection factors to calendar year 2016 for current pensioners and calendar year 2026 for future pensioners.
The mortality rates are scaled by a factor of 125% for non-executive members.
This equates to a man aged 65 living a further 20.7 years if he is a non-executive member, or 22.3 years if he is an executive member.
The corresponding figures for women were 23.4 and 25.1 years respectively.

The effect of this capital reorganisation transaction, which was treated as a reverse acquisition in the group financial statements, was to increase distributable reserves by 1,792.3m.
Share-based payments The company has share option schemes for approximately 500 senior executives worldwide.
The exercise price for share options is the mid-market closing price immediately preceding the date of grant.
Share options are equity settled.
Grants of share options under the Discretionary Approved and Discretionary Schemes the Discretionary Schemes are calculated by reference to base salaries and management grade in the company.
There are three levels of qualification under the Discretionary Schemes.
Level 1 applies to all senior executives including executive directors, Level 2 and deferred share schemes apply to executive directors and sector managing directors.
They are summarised as follows: 90 Financial statements Notes to the accounts Level 1: Before the exercise of an option under Level 1, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over the first three consecutive calendar years, commencing in the year in which the option is granted, is at least 4% per annum in excess of the UK rate of inflation.
Failing this, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over a greater period up to a maximum of ten years is at least 4% in excess of the UK rate of inflation.
Level 2: The exercise condition under Level 2 is by reference to total shareholder return, i. e. the appreciation of the share price including reinvested dividends in comparison with the performance of the FTSE 100 index and a defined group of support services companies being used as comparators, during three consecutive calendar years commencing in the year in which the option is granted, on the following basis: If the company achieves a median performance in relation to the FTSE 100 index, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 and, in addition, if the company achieves a median performance in the group of support services companies, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile in a group of support services companies.
Deferred share schemes: shares have been offered to executive directors and divisional managing directors to compensate for loss of bonuses or share options in their previous employment on joining the group during 2005.
Deferred shares are awarded to members based upon being in continued employment at the time of meeting the various grant dates in the future.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows: Weighted average Number exercise of share price options p per share 000 Outstanding at 1 January 2007 205.333 31,915 Exercised 155.448 398 Expired 217.602 6,692 Outstanding at 31 December 2007 202.825 24,825 Expired 216.409 12,018 Outstanding at 31 December 2008 190.078 12,807 Out of the 12.8m outstanding options, 2,639,812 options were exercisable at a weighted average price of 231.181p per share.
No options were exercised during the period.
Number Number Vesting 31 December 31 December Year of Grant Year 2007 Granted Lapsed 2008 2006 2009 8,527,251 332,058 8,195,193 2007 2010 9,707,074 1,283,362 8,423,712 2008 2011 10,245,358 10,245,358 The performance conditions for the 2006 and 2007 awards are earnings per share EPS growth for 50% of an award and total shareholder return TSR for the remaining 50% of an award.
For 75% of the TSR portion of an award, performance is measured by comparing the companys relative TSR performance to that of constituents of the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies.
For the remaining 25% of the TSR portion of an award, the companys TSR performance is measured against the constituents of an international group of support services companies.
Participants are entitled to the value of dividends that are paid during the vesting period on the number of shares that ultimately vest, in the form of additional shares transferred at the end of the vesting period.
The performance conditions for the 2008 awards are share price and the financial performance bonus multiplier of the group, division or business whichever is applicable to the award holder.
The share price condition is based on the highest average share price of Rentokil Initial plc over any sixty consecutive dealing days during the initial three-year period.
The performance period for the share price element of the award began on 1 April 2008 and ends sixty-one dealing days following the announcement of the companys results for the financial year ending 31 December 2010.
The annual bonus multiplier measures the extent to which the annual bonus targets have been achieved in respect of each financial year during the performance period.
The 2008 awards in the above table assume an on target share price of 180p per share is reached at the end of the vesting period and that participants achieve their target bonus in each of the three years over the vesting period.
No shares will vest if the share price does not reach 120p per share at the end of the vesting period and 200% will vest if the share price reaches 180p per share and all participants attain 110% of their bonus targets.
The fair value of the 2008 awards made under 2006 Performance Share Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived from a bespoke Monte Carlo simulation model.
The significant inputs into the model were a share price of 102p, an expected share price volatility of 21%, an expected dividend yield of 5% per annum and an expected life commensurate with the performance vesting period.
The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share prices measured until October 2007 therefore excluding the significant volatility during the last months of 2007, which the company would not expect going forward.
As the awards are nil-cost i. e. there is no exercise price, the assumed risk-free rate of return has minimal impact on the fair value of the awards.
Executive Share Plan In 2008, the company also introduced a long-term incentive plan for the chairman, chief executive and one other executive director and granted 22,500,000 during the year.
Number Number Exercise 31 December 31 December Year of Grant period 2007 Granted Lapsed 2008 2008 2011 2013 22,500,000 22,500,000 The performance condition for the award is share price and will only be satisfied if the share price target is achieved over a sustained period, demonstrating realisable value creation for shareholders.
This will be measured on the basis of an average share price over any 60 consecutive trading days during the performance measurement period.
Until a minimum share price of 120p per share has been met over a sustained period, no shares will be earned.
At 120p per share, 20% of the award would be earned, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting at a share price of 180p per share.
For achieving growth in market value between a share price of 180p per share and 280p per share further shares may be earned up to a maximum of a further 50% of the original award.
The 2008 awards in the same table 1 assume an on target share price of 180p per share is reached at the end of the vesting period.
Up to 3 of the award 92 Financial statements Notes to the accounts 1 1 may vest following the end of the third year, another 3 following the end of the fourth year and a further 3 following the end of the fifth year, based on the extent to which performance targets are achieved.
Any unvested portion of the award following the end of the fifth year will lapse.
See the Remuneration report on pages 38 to 46 for further details.
The fair value of the 2008 awards made under the Rentokil Initial 2008 Share Incentive Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived from a bespoke Monte Carlo simulation model.
The total net charge for the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment plans was 2.6m 2007: 2.2m.

In addition to the synergies above, the goodwill arising from the premium paid for Ray Werk represents the potential benefits and synergies available to the group from introducing its existing services to the Ray Werk customer base and geographic markets.
The goodwill attributable to the Watch All acquisition represents the premium paid to establish a presence in a geographic segment of the US market and to benefit from further integration synergies available to the group.
The goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Delcol represented the premium paid by the group to enter a new market segment in Asia.
This decision was subsequently reversed resulting in the withdrawal from this market and the impairment of the associated goodwill in 2008.
