Financial statements and notes Notes to the accounts For the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2008 Corporate information The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2008 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 2 July 2008.
Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance The groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2008 applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related party, Greene King Finance plc.
Greene King Finance plc is a special purpose entity set-up to raise bond finance for the group, which is consolidated as a quasi-subsidiary.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company with adjustments made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following: IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosure IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements There is no impact on the current or prior period financial position or results from the adoption of these standards and interpretations.
New disclosures that result from the adoption of IFRS 7, providing further details of the groups financial instruments and the nature and extent of risks arising from those financial instruments, are included throughout the financial statements and comparative information has been revised where necessary.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the assets including previously unrecognised intangible assets and liabilities including contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, and is stated at cost less any impairment in value.
For the purposes of impairment testing goodwill is allocated at business segment level which is the lowest group of cash generating units where goodwill is monitored by management.
Allocation is based on expectations of where benets from the synergies of the combination will result.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date has been carried forward as the carrying value.
Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves.
Such goodwill has not been reinstated and is not included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
GREENE KING PLC 30 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 1 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years, and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or useful life of the asset.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range from 3 to 20 years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is fide-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benets are expected from its use.
profit or loss on fide-recognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is included in the income statement in the year of fide-recognition.
Impairment Non-financial assets Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identiable cash inows independent of the cash inows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date whether there is an indication of impairment or reversal of impairment.
If an indication exists, the group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of each asset group, which is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, calculated using the identied cash ows of the asset groups.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets, including goodwill.
If there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of a business segment.
Where this is less than the carrying value of the business segment an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
Finance costs and income Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method and are not capitalised.
Finance income is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work in progress comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads, where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the consolidated cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as dened above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are fide-recognised when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash ows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
GREENE KING PLC 31 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 Financial statements and notes Notes to the accounts For the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2008 1 Accounting policies continued Financial assets Financial assets are classied as either financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets.
The group determines the classication of its financial assets at initial recognition and, where appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the groups beer.
Trade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in an active market and have therefore been designated as Loans and receivables, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are fide-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired.
If there is evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount and the expected future receipts excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate.
The loss is recognised in operating profit.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interestbearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate uctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception.
Documentation must include the groups risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged.
The group also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classied as either fair value hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability, or cash ow hedging the variability in cash ows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction.
The group uses its interest rate swaps as cash ow hedges.
Cash ow hedge accounting The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, unless the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting, amounts previously recognised in equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
GREENE KING PLC 32 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 1 Accounting policies continued Pensions and other post-employment benets Dened benefit pension schemes The group operates a number of dened benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds.
The cost of providing benets under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method on an annual basis.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benets have vested.
When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are re-measured and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement in the same period.
The interest cost on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are shown as a net amount on the face of the group income statement.
The dened benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes obligations, less past service costs not yet recognised, and less the fair value of scheme assets.
Dened benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
Dened contribution pension schemes The cost of the groups dened contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
Post-employment healthcare benefit The group also provided certain additional post-employment healthcare benets to employees which are unfunded.
The cost of providing these benets is determined on the same basis as the dened benefit pension schemes.
Share-based payments Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted.
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions, other than market conditions.
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the performance conditions are fullled ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest.
The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest provided vesting is not conditional on market related conditions.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reected as additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share gures.
In accordance with the exemption allowed under IFRS 1 for first time adopters, no expense is recorded in respect of grants made under the above schemes prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of transition to IFRS.
Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust.
The group has an employee benefit trust for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
GREENE KING PLC 33 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 Financial statements and notes Notes to the accounts For the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2008 1 Accounting policies continued Revenue Generally, revenue represents external sales excluding taxes of goods and services, net of discounts.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty.
Revenue principally consists of: Goods Drink and food sales Recognised at the point at which goods are provided either wholesale or in the groups outlets.
Services Accommodation sales Recognised at the point at which the services are provided.
Rental income Recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Machine income Net takings recognised as earned.
Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benets of ownership are classied as operating leases.
Lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as current the portion relating to the next financial period or non-current prepayments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxes Income tax The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss or in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are dened as items of income or expense which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the period.
GREENE KING PLC 34 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 1 Accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations not applied A number of standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group.
These are as follows: IFRS 8 Operating Segments The standard replaced IAS 14, with revised requirements for the identication, measurement and disclosure of segment information.
IAS 1 amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures The amendment to the standard will require the company to choose whether to rename the primary statements and whether to present the new statement of comprehensive income as a single statement replacing the income statement or as two statements.
IAS 23 Borrowing Costs The revised standard requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to an asset that necessarily takes a substantial amount of time to get ready for its intended use or sale.
In addition, the following standards and interpretations have been issued, none of which are anticipated to signicantly impact the groups results or assets and liabilities and are not expected to require additional disclosure: IFRS 2 amendment Vesting Conditions and Cancellations IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised January 2008 IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised January 2008 IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programs IFRIC 14-IAS 19 The Limit of Dened benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their interaction significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions considered to be significant are detailed below: Impairment of non-financial assets The group determines whether non-financial assets are impaired on at least an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating unit that the assets are grouped within.
Value in use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash ows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash ows.
If the actual cashows are lower than estimated, future impairments may be necessary.
Impairment of goodwill The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shown in note 14.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
If the actual cash ows are lower than estimated, future impairments may be necessary.
Residual values Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends.
If residual values were lower than estimated, an impairment of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required.
Useful economic lives are reassessed annually which may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Pension liabilities The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in note 9.
Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities.
Taxation Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be nally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Tax benets are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained.
Tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise.
The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
GREENE KING PLC 35 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 Financial statements and notes Notes to the accounts For the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2008 2 Segment information The groups primary reporting format is business segments which are divided into four core trading segments and are managed separately.
Retail covers the results of managed houses and restaurants, Pub Partners covers the results of tenanted houses, Brewing Company covers brewing beer, marketing and selling, all predominantly in England.
Belhaven covers the results of our Scottish operation which includes managed and tenanted houses and brewing and selling beer.
Corporate includes central costs and central assets liabilities.
Retail includes 39 weeks trading from the acquired Loch Fyne Restaurants business which contributed 3.4m profit before tax.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arms-length basis.
EBITDA represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items and is calculated as operating profit before exceptionals adjusted for the depreciation charge for the period.
Geographical segments The groups secondary format is geographical segments.
The groups assets and operations are predominantly located within the UK.
As the group has virtually only domestic activities, segment reporting is only required by business segment.

GREENE KING PLC 39 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 Financial statements and notes Notes to the accounts For the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2008 8 Share-based payment plans continued The fair value of equity-settled options and LTIP contingently issued shares are estimated using a Black-Scholes model.
The fair value of the grants and model inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows: 2008 LTIP ESOS SAYE Weighted average share price 808p 1087p 694p Exercise price 1087p 519p Expected dividend yield 4.9% 4.9% 4.9% Risk-free rate of return 4.6% 5.5% 4.1% Volatility 25.3% 18.9% 27.6% Expected life years 3.0 6.5 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 698p 289p 189p 2007 LTIP ESOS SAYE Weighted average share price 936p 813p 1150p Exercise price 813p 865p Expected dividend yield 2.1% 2.1% 2.1% Risk-free rate of return 4.8% 4.6% 5.1% Volatility 21.5% 21.2% 22.1% Expected life years 3.0 6.5 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 880p 200p 374p Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the companys share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of future trends.
Expected life of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period.
This is not necessarily indicative of future exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.
The SIP shares are issued to employees after the period end at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
As such, this is their fair value and the assumptions stated above are not relevant for this scheme.
Movement in outstanding options and rights during the period is as follows: Weighted average Number of options exercise price 2008 2007 2008 2007 ESOS m m p p Outstanding at the beginning of the period 3.5 3.1 622 512 Granted 1.1 1.2 1,087 813 Forfeited 0.3 0.3 759 647 Exercised 0.4 0.5 501 400 Outstanding at the end of the period 3.9 3.5 755 622 Exercisable at the end of the period 1.0 0.6 446 390 Balance at the beginning of the period includes 0.3m 2007: 0.4m shares under options granted before 7 November 2002 and 0.3m 2007: 0.3m at the end of period.

ESOS, SAYE and LTIP Options were exercised on a range of dates.
The weighted average share price through the period was 860p in 2008 and 956p in 2007.
The rights outstanding at 4 May 2008 under the LTIP had an exercise price of nil 2007: nil and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.7 years 2007: 2.1 years.
The outstanding options for the ESOS scheme had an exercise price between 370p and 1087p 2007: 264p and 813p and for the SAYE scheme between 282p and 865p 2007: 285p and 865p.
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 7.5 years for the ESOS 2007: 7.9 years and 2.8 years for the SAYE scheme 2007: 2.9 years.
SIP The cost of the SIP is accrued at the year end based on the expected value of payout.
The amount accrued at 4 May 2008 for the current years service is nil 2007: 2.4m as disclosed in note 6.
The shares issued during the period to employees were in relation to their services in the prior period.
The number of shares issued was 0.3m with a share price on date of grant of 958p.
The SIP shares are held within an external trust until the employee elects to sell.
9 Pensions The group maintains a dened contribution scheme, which is open to all new employees, and a number of dened benefit schemes.
The group also has a past service liability in relation to post-employment medical benets offered to employees to cover any medical costs after employment.
The benefit is no longer given to new employees.
Dened contribution pension scheme Member funds for the dened contribution scheme are held and administered by the Prudential Assurance Company.
The total cost recognised in operating profit for the period was 3.0m 2007: 2.1m.
Dened benefit pension schemes and post-employment benets The group maintains the following dened benefit schemes which are all closed to new entrants and have had full actuarial valuations in the last four years: Greene King Pension Scheme closed 2 May 1997, last valued 5 April 2006, Morland Pension Scheme closed 12 December 2000, last valued 5 April 2006, Tolly Cobbold Pension Scheme closed 29 July 2002, last valued 1 December 2004, Belhaven Pension Scheme closed 31 October 2005, last valued 31 March 2005, and the Hardys & Hansons Pension Scheme closed 1 July 2003, last valued 30 April 2006.
Member funds for the dened benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the groups nances and are administered by pension trustees.
Pension benets are related to members final salary at retirement and their length of service.
The group has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the statement of recognised income and expense.

The values of the schemes liabilities have been determined by a qualied actuary based on the results of the last actuarial valuation, updated to 4 May 2008 using the following principal actuarial assumptions: 2008 2007 % % Discount rate 6.1 5.6 Expected rates of salary increases 5.5 5.0 Expected pension payment increases 3.6 3.1 Rate of inflation 3.7 3.2 Healthcare cost increase 9.0 9.0 The mortality assumptions imply the following expectations of years of life from age 65: 2008 2007 Man currently aged 40 23.2 20.5 Woman currently aged 40 25.9 23.4 Man currently aged 65 20.8 19.0 Woman currently aged 65 23.6 21.9 Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for scheme experience and with an allowance for future improvement in life expectancy.
Overall expected rate of return on assets is established by applying brokers forecasts to each category of scheme asset.

The effect of the reduced rate is a deferred tax credit of 13.7m in the period.
This is included within the tax credit of 16.1m shown under exceptional items which is also stated after an income tax charge of 0.3m on exceptional interest income, an income tax credit of 0.8m on exceptional integration costs, a deferred tax credit of 3.5m on indexation of properties, a deferred tax charge of 3.8m on disposal of properties and a 2.2m tax credit for tax losses not previously recognised following the Laurel acquisition.
The tax recoverable on exceptional items of 4.4m in the prior period was in respect of tax relief on integration costs and finance break costs.
The exceptional tax credit of 3.0m in the prior year was in respect of tax relief on intra-group transactions eliminated on consolidation.

As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
The adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill are due to the post-acquisition utilisation of tax losses, which were not recognised as deferred tax assets following the acquisition of Laurel during 2004 05.
14 Impairment testing of goodwill Goodwill has been allocated to business segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored internally, based on the extent that the benets of acquisitions ow to that segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 236.4m 2007: 180.8m to Retail, 172.3m 2007: 161.8m to Pub Partners, 138.7m 2007: 138.7m to Brewing Company, and 126.4m 2007: 126.4m to Belhaven.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined based on a value-in-use calculation, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used for all business segments are the discount rate applied to cash ow projections of 9.0% 2007: 9.0% and the projected cash ows beyond the one year budgets are extrapolated using a growth rate in line with an expected long-term ination rate of 2.0% 2007: 2.0% which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relating to market growth, market share and sales prices have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
Other assets relate to property, plant and equipment associated with unlicensed properties ie brewing, distribution, and central assets.
The net book value of land and buildings comprises: 2008 2007 m m Freehold properties 1,694.9 1,638.1 Leasehold properties 50 years unexpired term 67.7 66.6 Leasehold properties 50 years unexpired term 27.6 18.8 1,790.2 1,723.5 Valuation The licensed estate properties were valued by the groups own professionally qualied chartered surveyors, as at 20 December 2003, on the basis of existing use value, in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Appraisal and Valuation Standards.
A representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, who confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal.
Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition to IFRS, therefore no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value.
These valuations have been retained but they have not been updated.
Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, at fair value.
Charges over assets Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of 1,287.4m 2007: 1,236.6m over which there is a first charge in favour of the securitised debt holders as detailed in note 23.

During the year 0.2m of the provision was utilised and 0.5m of new provision was created.
All trade loans, net of any provision recognised, are considered to be neither past due nor impaired.
Trade loans are advanced to customers on terms linked to supply terms such that returns are greater than interest income.
The xed rate trade loans amounted to 27.4m 2007: 24.1m and variable rate trade loans amounted to 10.3m 2007: 10.6m.
Included in xed rate loans are 13.3m of loans with settlement related to purchase levels 2007: 14.1m.
The write-down of these loans has been taken on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the loan as an approximation of the write-down.
This is not necessarily the actual write-down that will occur.
The xed rate trade loans had a weighted average interest rate of 2.24% 2007: 1.02% and a weighted average period of 6.72 years 2007: 6.23 years.

In respect of Loch Fyne the goodwill also recognises the proven ability of management to grow the business.
The main fair value adjustments relate to the revaluation of the freehold and leasehold properties acquired, recognition of related deferred tax liability on these revaluations and, in relation to Loch Fyne, the reversal of goodwill on previous business combinations.
The fair value of properties acquired was established following a review that was carried out by qualied surveyors employed by the company.
Retained properties have been revalued at their existing use value and properties subsequently disposed have been valued at their fair value less costs to sell.
The value of other current assets and liabilities have been adjusted to amounts to be realised or paid respectively.
The fair values presented in the interim statements in respect of Loch Fyne were provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition to the interim date.
The changes to these numbers are not significant and have resulted from the reassessment of certain prepayments and accruals.
The net cash ow impact of the acquisitions was: 2008 2007 m m Cash paid 35.5 172.0 Net cash acquired overdraft 1.3 0.5 Net cash outflow 34.2 172.5 From the date of acquisition Loch Fyne has contributed 3.4m operating profit and 13.3m net cash outows to the group results.
From the date of acquisition the New Century Inns business has contributed operating profits of 1.1m.
Following the integration of the New Century Inns business it is no longer practical to identify the related cash ows separately.
In the prior year from the date of acquisition, Hardys & Hansons has contributed 12.2m operating profit to the group results.
As a result of integrating the Hardys & Hansons operations, it was no longer practical to identify the related post acquisition cash ows for Hardys & Hansons separately.
Prior to acquisition the results of the acquired businesses were prepared under UK GAAP using different accounting policies and bases, and therefore a proforma trading result has not been produced.

The group has facilities of 35.0m 2007: 35m available with interest linked to base rate.
Bank loans unsecured The group has a five-year revolving credit facility, signed on 26 April 2007, of 550m, which was 480m 2007: 235m drawn at the year end.
In addition the group has an 18 month revolving credit facility, signed on 9 April 2008, of 40m, which was 20m 2007: nil drawn down at the year end.
The amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payment on the undrawn portions.
Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity.
Although the individual draw-downs are repayable within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding.
Immediate renewal is available under the 550m facility until April 2012, and under the 40m facility until 9 October 2009, hence the related debt has been classied as non-current.
Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
The effective interest rate for 335.0m of the 500m drawn-down is 6.02% after the effect of swaps, with the remaining 165m at a rate linked to LIBOR.
The xed rate loan attracts interest at 7.351% and is payable annually.
The principal is repayable over the term of the loan by annual payments in accordance with the payment schedule.
Securitised debt On 7 March 2005, 600.0m of bonds were issued in connection with the securitisation of 904 of the groups pubs held in Greene King Retailing Limited.
The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Greene King Finance plc.
The funds were used to repay existing bank facilities and pay related issue costs.
On 8 May 2006, a further 550m of bonds were issued as a tap of the original securitisation, involving an additional 801 of the groups pubs, held in Greene King Retailing Limited.
These were issued under substantially the same terms as the original securitisation.
The funds were used to repay existing bank facilities, pay related issue costs of 4.3m and early redemption of the debentures, incurring an accelerated interest cost of 0.7m, debenture redemption costs of 4.0m, and swap termination costs of 4.7m.

GREENE KING PLC 52 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 23 Borrowings continued Repayment of nominal is made by quarterly instalments, in accordance with the repayment schedule, within the date ranges shown above.
Payment of interest is made on quarterly dates for all classes of bond.
All of the oating rate bonds are fully hedged using interest rate swaps.
The Class A1, A2, A3, and A4 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds.
The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, principal repayment and interest payment.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, a group company.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash to other group companies.
Loan notes unsecured The group issued loan notes during 2006 07 in connection with the Hardys & Hansons acquisition.
These have a maturity date of September 2011 and bear interest at a margin below LIBOR, payable semi-annually.
The effective interest rate of the loan notes is 4.57% after taking into consideration the effect of interest rate swaps.
These loan notes are redeemable on demand of the holders on any of the interest payment dates and as such have been classied as current debt.
During the year the group issued 14.4m of new loan notes with a maturity date of August 2009 in connection with the Loch Fyne acquisition.
11.8m of these loans attracted interest at margin below LIBOR with the remainder attracting interest at a xed rate of 5.86%.
Interest is payable on repayment of the loan notes.
At the year end 0.6m of these loan notes remained outstanding and these amounts have been classied as non-current debt.
24 Financial instruments The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group.
If appropriate, the group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, loan notes, cash and short-term deposits.
Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, payables, and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the groups operations and nancing sources.
No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the groups financial instruments are cash ow risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The policy for managing each of these risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk Exposure to changes in interest rates on the groups borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity prole and cash ows of the underlying debt.
The group uses a mixture of xed and oating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate uctuations primarily arising from the oating rate instruments.
The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be hedged.
The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure.
The swaps are designated as cash ow hedges at the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every six months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of xed to oating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 4 May 2008 and 29 April 2007.
The analysis relates only to balances at these dates and is not representative of the year as a whole.
The following assumptions were made: Balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivitative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move.
Gains and loss are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group.
Cash ow hedges were effective.
Based on the groups net position at the year end, a 1% change in interest rates would change the groups profit before tax by approximately 0.5m 2007: 0.6m and the groups equity by 51.3m 2007: 48.3m.
GREENE KING PLC 53 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 Financial statements and notes Notes to the accounts For the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2008 24 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt.
The groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and exibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
The group also monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the company has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end 2007: 60 days following month end.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities xed at no more than one month.
Short-term exibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
The table below summarises the maturity prole of the groups financial liabilities at 4 May 2008 and 29 April 2007 based on contractual undiscounted payments including interest.
Period ended 4 May 2008 Within One to Two to More than one year two years five years five years Total m m m m m Interest bearing loans and borrowings: Capital 61.0 42.7 547.1 1,057.0 1,707.8 Interest 91.6 88.6 229.8 769.5 1,179.5 152.6 131.3 776.9 1,826.5 2,887.3 Derivative financial instruments 1.0 1.0 1.4 5.5 8.9 Trade and other payables 198.7 198.7 352.3 132.3 778.3 1,832.0 3,094.9 Period ended 29 April 2007 Within One to Two to More than one year two years five years five years Total m m m m m Interest bearing loans and borrowings: Capital 136.8 20.7 306.0 1,075.2 1,538.7 Interest 78.1 76.9 223.2 828.0 1,206.2 214.9 97.6 529.2 1,903.2 2,744.9 Derivative financial instruments 0.2 0.2 0.6 3.6 4.6 Trade and other payables 168.2 168.2 383.3 97.8 529.8 1,906.8 2,917.7 Credit risk The policy for third-party trading is that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to regular credit verication procedures.
Receivable balances are also monitored on an on-going basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad debts to a non-significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans, cash, and certain derivative instruments.
Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation, the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash ow hedging At 4 May 2008, the group held nine 2007: six interest rate swap contracts, with a nominal value of 410.0m 2007: 265.0m, designated as hedges of the cash ow interest rate risk of 410.0m 2007: 265.0m of the groups variable rate borrowings excluding bonds.
These are held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of 1.0m 2007: asset of 3.5m.
The cash ows occur quarterly and semi-annually, receiving a variable rate of interest based on the base rate or LIBOR, which ranged from 4.50% to 5.67% 2007: 4.50% to 5.67%, and paying a xed rate ranging from 4.53% to 5.85% 2007: 4.53% to 5.09%.
Remaining contract maturity dates range from June 2008 to May 2013.
GREENE KING PLC 54 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 24 Financial instruments continued At 4 May 2008, the group also held two 2007: two interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 435.0m 2007: 435.0m, entered into as part of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation tap.
A fair value liability of 4.5m 2007: asset of 2.3m has been recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash ow hedges against 435.0m 2007: 435.0m of variable rate bonds, receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average xed rate of 4.947% 2007: 4.947%.
The contract maturity dates are June 2034 and March 2036.
The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Changes in cash ow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The cash ow hedges have been assessed as being highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
The net unrealised loss of 11.3m was included in equity in respect of these contracts.
The percentage of debt that was xed as at the year end was 96.8% 2007: 96.1% in line with the groups policy of xing at least 95% of all debt.
Interest rate risk The following tables set out the groups exposure to interest rate risk and the maturity prole for each class of interest bearing financial asset and financial liability.
The interest on xed rate financial instruments is xed until the maturity of the instrument.
Investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are not included in the above as they are non-interest bearing and are not subject to interest rate risk.

Fair values and effective interest rates of derivatives and other borrowings have been based on quotations from counterparties and represent estimates of the amount the group would expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.
Carrying values are stated net of any deferred finance fees which amounted to 10.7m 2007: 11.1m.
The fair value of cash and other financial assets is not materially different from book value.
Capital risk management The group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining a strong credit rating and a core level of debt which optimises the weighted average cost of capital WACC and shareholder value.
A number of mechanisms are used to manage debt and equity levels, as appropriate in the light of economic and trading conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the period.
The group monitors capital using interest cover and several other measures including xed charged cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and free cash ow debt service coverage.
Interest cover is calculated by dividing operating profit before exceptional items by net finance costs before exceptional items note 7.
For the period to 4 May 2008 interest cover was 2.5x 2007: 2.8x.
