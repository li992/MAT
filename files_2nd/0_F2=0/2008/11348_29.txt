Goodwill has been allocated to the Water and waste water cash-generating unit and the other intangible asset has been allocated to the Northumbrian Water Limited cash-generating unit, which are also the reportable segments.
The other intangible asset represents the right in perpetuity to receive income under the operating agreement with the Environment Agency in respect of the Kielder Water transfer scheme and, therefore, the directors consider the asset has an indefinite life.
Accordingly, future cash flows, which increase in line with inflation, have been discounted at a rate of 6.21% in perpetuity.
This represents a long term nominal gilt yield and an assumed credit spread.
This calculation satisfied the Group that the carrying value at 31 March 2008 had not been impaired.
Furthermore, it is improbable that the discount rate would increase to such a level that the carrying value would be impaired.
