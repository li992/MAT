FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 25.
Disposals On 19 July 2007 the Group disposed of its Brokerage business, renamed MF Global, through an initial public offering IPO on the New York Stock Exchange.
Its results, up to the date of separation, are presented in these financial statements as a discontinued operation.
The IPO resulted in the disposal of 81.4% of the share capital of MF Global, giving rise to a gain on sale of $1.7 billion.
The residual shareholding held by the Group has been reclassified as an available-for-sale investment and carried at fair value, with fair value movements taken to the availablefor-sale reserve within equity.
The fair value of the residual holding was $221 million at 31 March 2008.
The net proceeds of $2.7 billion received from the separation of MF Global were returned to shareholders through a B and C share scheme, undertaken on 26 November 2007.
The assets of the discontinued operation disposal group are presented separately from other assets on the Group balance sheet and the liabilities of the discontinued operation disposal group are presented separately from other liabilities on the Group balance sheet.
The assets and liabilities of the disposal group classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The post-tax result of the discontinued operation is shown as a single amount on the face of the Group income statement.
In determining the post-tax result of the discontinued operation only those central costs eliminated on disposal are allocated to the discontinued operation.

On 1 June 2007 the Group acquired 100% of FXA Securities for $32 million.
This entity was subsequently disposed of as part of the MF Global IPO transaction.
At the time of the IPO, the Man Group, in the normal course of business, was guaranteeing MF Globals obligations to some of its clients.
Since the IPO, all of these guarantees have either been terminated or novated into the name of MF Global.
Legal proceedings On 28 February 2008, MF Global announced that it had incurred a significant credit loss.
Following this disclosure a number of plaintiffs filed class action law suits in the U. S. Federal Court asserting various causes of action arising out of the US initial public offering.
The Group is named as a defendant in these filings but has not been served, although it is anticipated that the Group will be served.
The complaints allege claims under certain sections of the US Securities Act of 1933.
They allege, for example, that the public disclosure documents for the offering contained false and misleading statements concerning risk management and trading risk controls at MF Global.
This class action is at a preliminary stage and it is expected that the court will appoint a lead plaintiff to represent all claimants later in the year.
The Group believes that it has substantial defences to the action and intends to defend the case vigorously.
Year ended 31 March 2007 There were no disposals in the financial year ended 31 March 2007.
