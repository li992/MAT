The Directors consider the only class of asset containing significant credit risk is trade receivables.
The average credit term for sales of goods is 59 days 2007: 56 days.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts of 32.3m 2007: 21.5m, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values.
No interest is charged on the trade receivable from the date of the invoice until the date the invoice is classified as overdue according to the trading terms agreed between the Group and the customer.
Thereafter, the Group retains the right to charge interest at 4% above the National Westminster Bank base rate per annum on the outstanding balance.
The Group has provided fully for all receivables outstanding over 90 days beyond agreed terms.
Trade receivables between 0 and 90 days are specifically provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are unprovided against debtors with a carrying amount of 28.9m 2007: 22.8m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not identified a significant change in credit quality and as such, the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.
Except for some instances of personal guarantees the Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the amount it is anticipated will be recovered.
None of the Companys debts are overdue.
The directors do not consider there to be any significant credit risk, as the majority of the debt is due from subsidiaries.
