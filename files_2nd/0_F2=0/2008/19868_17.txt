The two subsidiaries are partners in a Guernsey Limited Partnership and own a Jersey Property Unit Trust.
Both the Partnership and UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited own a portfolio of UK properties and derived rental income from those properties.
As both the Partnership and Trust property holding entities are considered tax transparent in the UK, their taxable results are taxed in the two subsidiaries.
Both are liable to UK income tax at the rate of 20.5 per cent on their respective net rental income.

CB Richard Ellis Limited completed a valuation of Group investment properties at 31 December 2008 on an open market basis in accordance with the requirements of the Appraisal and Valuation Manual published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which is deemed to equate to fair value.
Fair value is determined by reference to market based evidence, which is the amounts for which the assets could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The market value of these investment properties amounted to 560,120,000 2007: 773,095,000 which is also the fair value.
The property valuer is external to the Group.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation when the Investment Managers advise of the presence of such materials.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 17 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Group's investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of such property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where the actual sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
The Group is under no contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop any investment property.
The majority of the leases are on a full repairing basis and as such the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs, maintenance or enhancements to its investment properties.
Included within the total market value of the property portfolio, are units in the Jersey Property Unit Trust which holds the property at Kensington High Street, London.
99.5 per cent of the units in this Unit Trust are held by UKCPT Limited Partnership and 0.5 per cent is held by UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited.

Financial Instruments The Groups investment objective is to provide Ordinary Shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for income and capital growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
In addition, the Groups financial instruments consist of cash, receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
The Group has no borrowings at the year end.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing its risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and remained unchanged during the year.
Fair values The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not different from the carrying value in the financial statements.
The valuation of the property portfolio assumes that the properties had been properly marketed and that an exchange of contracts took place on the 31 December 2008.
Given the fact that the current volatility in the global financial system has created a significant degree of turbulence in commercial real estate markets, and the lack of liquidity in the capital markets, means that it may be very difficult to achieve a sale of property assets in the short-term.
UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 32 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups financial assets was: Financial Assets 2008 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 64,610 - - 64,610 Rent receivable 898 - - 898 Other debtors and prepayments 606 104 3,517 4,227 66,114 104 3,517 69,735 Financial Assets 2007 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 33,593 - - 33,593 Rent receivable 3,642 - - 3,642 Other debtors and prepayments 248 46 2,529 2,823 37,483 46 2,529 40,058 In the event of default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property until it is re-let.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Managers monitor such reports in order to anticipate and minimise the impact of defaults by occupational tenants.
The Company has a diversified tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2008 is 898,000 2007: 3,642,000.
The Group holds rental deposits of 425,000 2007: 473,000 held as collateral against tenant arrears defaults.
There is no credit risk associated with the financial liabilities of the Group.
All of the cash is placed with financial institutions with a credit rating of A or above.
Bankruptcy or insolvency may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, the Manager would move the cash holdings to another financial institution.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
The Groups investments comprise UK commercial property.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of each property.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where such sales occur shortly after the valuation date At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups liabilities was: Financial Liabilities 2008 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Other Creditors 11,015 1,059 436 12,510 Financial Liabilities 2007 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Other Creditors 12,161 1,814 426 14,401 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 33 Interest rate risk The cash balance as shown in the Balance Sheet, is its carrying amount and has a maturity of less than 1 year.
Interest is receivable on cash at a variable rate ranging between 1.3 per cent to 2.0 per cent at the year end and deposits are re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
An increase of 1 per cent in interest rates as at the reporting date would have reduced the reported loss by 646,000 2007: reduced the reported loss by 336,000.
A decrease of 1 per cent would have increased the reported loss by 646,000 2007: increased the reported loss by 336,000.
The other financial assets and liabilities of Group are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Foreign Currency Risk There was no foreign currency risk as at 31 December 2008 or 31 December 2007 as assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds Sterling.
Capital Management Policies The Groups capital is managed in accordance with investment policy which is to hold a diversified property portfolio of freehold and long leasehold UK commercial properties.
The Group intends to invest in income producing investments.
The Group will principally invest in three commercial property sectors: office, retail and industrial.
The Group will be permitted to invest up to 15 per cent.
of its Total Assets in indirect property funds but will not invest in other listed investment companies.
The Group will be permitted to invest cash, held by it for working capital purposes and awaiting investments, in cash deposits, gilts and money market funds.
The Groups capital balances are set out on page 25.
Capital Commitments The Group has no capital commitments as at 31 December 2008 2007: nil.
Lease Length The Group leases out its investment properties under operating leases.
The future annual income based on the unexpired lessor lease length at the year end was as follows based on total rentals : 31 December 2008 31 December 2007 000 000 Less than one year 452 2,236 Between one and five years 10,109 8,759 Over five years 34,139 34,871 Total 44,700 45,866 The largest single tenant at the year end accounted for 9.57 per cent 2007: 8.26 per cent of the current annual rental income.
The unoccupied property expressed as a percentage of estimated total rental value was 3.25 per cent 2007: 2.99 per cent at the year end.
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio.
These properties, held under operating leases, are measured under the fair value model as the properties are held to earn rentals.
The majority of these non-cancellable leases have remaining non-cancellable lease terms of between 5 and 15 years.
Analysis of the nature of investment properties and leases are provided in Portfolio Statistics on page 12.
Post Balance Sheet Events On 17 March 2009 the Company purchased 28,571,429 of its own Ordinary Shares of 25p, to be held in treasury at a price of 52.5p per share.
Following this, the total number of shares held in treasury is 41,445,142.
