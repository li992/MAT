Notes to the Mondi Limited parent company financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The balance sheet and selected notes of Mondi Limited have been prepared in accordance with applicable IFRS.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied by Mondi Limited are the same as those presented in note 1 to the combined and consolidated Group financial statements, to the extent that the Groups transactions and balances are applicable to a set of the company financial statements.
Principally, the accounting policies which are not directly relevant to Mondi Limited parent company financial statements are those relating to consolidation accounting and the recognition and subsequent measurement of goodwill.
The accounting policies which are either different, or additional, to those applied by the Group are stated as follows: Investments Investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures are reflected at cost less amounts written off and provisions for any impairments.
Share-based payments Mondi Limited operates a number of share-based payment plans for its own staff and staff employed by other Group entities.
The fair value of an equity instrument granted under such a plan is recorded in the share-based payments reserve incrementally over the contractually determined vesting period and either recognised as a capital contribution to the employing subsidiaries, where applicable, or within profit or loss.
At each balance sheet date, estimates regarding the future probability of service, and non-market performance conditions being met are revised on a basis consistent with recent experience.
Any resultant revisions of original estimates are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of investments in employing Group entities or profit or loss, as appropriate, and the share-based payments reserve.
Employing Group entities reimburse Mondi Limited for the cost of equity instruments granted.
Reimbursement receipts represent a return of capital contributed and are treated as a reduction in the cost of investments in employing Group entities.
Accounting estimates and critical judgements The accounting estimates and critical judgements applied by the key management of Mondi Limited are discussed in the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements see note 1.
