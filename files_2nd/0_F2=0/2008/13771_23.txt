It will be paid on 6 March 2009 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 6 February 2009.
These financial statements do not reflect this dividend payable.
6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust note 22, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plan.
At 30 September 2008, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the incentive scheme had not been met and consequently the shares in question are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2008 2007 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per share number of Per share Earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount m millions pence m millions pence Basic EPS Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 166.3 1,306.5 12.73 154.1 1,299.9 11.85 Effect of dilutive securities Options 3.8 0.04 7.1 0.06 Diluted EPS 166.3 1,310.3 12.69 154.1 1,307.0 11.79 79 Adjusted EPS Non GAAP measure 2008 2007 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per share number of Per share Earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount m millions pence m millions pence Basic EPS Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 166.3 1,306.5 12.73 154.1 1,299.9 11.85 Non GAAP items: Intangible asset amortisation excluding amortisation of computer software 32.4 28.0 Taxation 10.0 8.7 Net adjustments 22.4 1.7119.3 1.49 Adjusted basic EPS 188.7 1,306.5 14.44 173.4 1,299.9 13.34 Exchange adjustments Exchange adjustments 13.8 Taxation 4.3 Net exchange adjustments 9.5 0.73 Adjusted basic EPS after exchange adjustments 188.7 1,306.5 14.44 182.9 1,299.9 14.07 Effect of dilutive securities Options 3.8 0.04 7.1 0.08 Adjusted diluted EPS after exchange adjustments 188.7 1,310.3 14.40 182.9 1,307.0 13.99 Exchange adjustments relate to the retranslation of prior year results to current year exchange rates as shown in the table on page 38 within the Financial review.

During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
For the purposes of this impairment review, goodwill has been valued on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising in each relevant cash-generating unit.
Details of the restatement are included in the Group accounting policies on page 69.
Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to one or more cash-generating units CGUs.
CGUs represent the operations of a country or, in more material operations, divisions within a country.
2007 The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the balance sheet date 2008 Restated by geographic area: m m UK & Ireland 213.2 181.1 France 251.9 198.1 Germany 24.8 22.0 Switzerland 32.1 26.9 Poland 8.0 6.4 Spain 116.1 94.5 North America 1,103.7 969.4 South Africa 34.1 31.3 Australia 24.7 22.7 Asia 16.9 14.6 1,825.5 1,567.0 The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
In all cases, the approved budget for the following financial year formed the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
The approved cash flow projections in the four financial years following the budget year reflected managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet date and the risks specific to the CGU.
The long-term operating margin assumed for a CGUs operations is primarily based on past performance.
For some CGUs, those for which management has strong reason to believe that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins, expected future improvements from sustainable operating cost savings are also included in managements assessment of the long-term operating margin.
The long-term operating margin applied to CGUs was in the range of 8% 2007: 18% to 47% 2007: 45%.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the country in which the CGUs operations are undertaken and were in the range of 1.0% 2007: 1.0% to 5.0% 2007: 5.0%.
Goodwill impairment tests were conducted separately for each CGU.
Intangible assets apart from internally generated IPR&D and computer software relate to identifiable assets purchased as part of the Groups business combinations.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life.
Lease rentals amounting to 0.7m 2007: 3.4m and 27.5m 2007: 17.6m relating to the lease of plant and machinery and property respectively are included in the income statement note 3.

The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk since the risk is spread over a large number of unrelated counterparties.
The directors estimate that the carrying value of financial assets within trade and other receivables approximated their fair value.
The Group considers the credit quality of trade and other receivables by geographical location.
The Group consider that the carrying value of the trade and other receivables that is disclosed below gives a fair presentation of the credit quality of the assets.
This is considered to be the case as there is a low risk of default due to the high number of recurring customers and credit control policies, thus the carrying value is expected to be the final value received.

The directors believe that there is no further provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in selling and administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally written-off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
At 30 September 2008, trade receivables of 52.5m 2007: 38.9m were either partially or fully impaired.
2008 2007 The ageing of these receivables was as follows: m m Not due 7.5 7.8 Less than six months past due 25.0 14.2 More than six months past due 20.0 16.9 52.5 38.9 Trade receivables which were past their due date but not impaired at 30 September 2008 were 65.4m 2007: 53.8m.
2008 2007 The ageing of these receivables was as follows: m m Less than six months past due 60.8 49.4 More than six months past due 4.6 4.4 65.4 53.8 The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivables mentioned above, the Group held no collateral as security.
The directors estimate that the carrying value of trade receivables approximated their fair value.
12 Cash and cash equivalents 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement comprise: m m Cash at bank and in hand 69.8 64.3 Short-term bank deposits 0.3 1.3 70.1 65.6 The effective interest rate on short-term deposits was 3.2% 2007: 5.0% and these deposits have an average maturity of 30 days 2007: 44 days.
Groups credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties are well established banks with high credit ratings.

Bank loans are denominated in a number of currencies and bear interest based on LIBOR or foreign equivalents appropriate to the country in which the borrowing is incurred.
Included in loans above is 575.0m 2007: 561.5m of unsecured loans after unamortised issue costs taken out in connection with acquisitions.
This is drawn down under 850.0m multi-currency revolving credit facilities, 650.0m expiring on 4 August 2011 and 200.0m expiring by 13 January 2011 with 100.0m amortising a year earlier.
In the table above, loans are stated net of unamortised issue costs of 0.5m 2007: 1.0m.
The Group has incurred total issue costs of 7.6m 2007: 7.3m in respect of these facilities.
These costs are allocated to the income statement over the term of the facility using the effective interest method.
Unsecured borrowings were drawn in the following currencies: Sterling 75.3m 2007: nil : US Dollar 290.6m 2007: 314.2m, Euro 208.8m 2007: 235.9m and Swiss Franc 13.9m 2007: 11.4m and bear interest at a rate of 0.45% 2007: 0.45% above LIBOR.

The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements.
The Groups treasury policies and procedures are periodically reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee and are subject to regular Group Internal Audit review.
Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital defined as net debt note 25 plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, with respect to changes in economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and longterm cash flow forecasts.
The Group has committed facilities which are available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital see below.
The Groups Treasury function has a policy of reducing the level of cash in the business in order to minimise external borrowings.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the undiscounted contractual amount of the Groups financial liabilities at 30 September was as follows: 2008 2007 Trade and Trade and other other Borrowings payables Total Borrowings payables Total m m m m m m In less than one year 13.9 247.2 261.1 0.3 210.2 210.5 In more than one year but not more than two years 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 In more than two years but not more than five years 639.9 639.9 666.2 666.2 654.0 247.2 901.2 666.6 210.2 876.8 Borrowing facilities The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 30 September in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date: 2008 2007 Total Total m m Expiring within one year Expiring between one and two years Expiring in more than two years 274.6 287.7 274.6 287.7 The facilities have been arranged to help finance the proposed expansion of the Groups activities.
All these facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty may default on their obligation to the Group in relation to lending, settlement and other financial activities.
The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables and bank balances and cash.
The Groups credit risk primarily arises from trade and other receivables.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The Group has a very low credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on liquid funds is considered to be low, as the Audit Committee approved Group Treasury Policy limits the value that can be invested with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group does not hold collateral over any of these financial assets.
87 Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
At 30 September 2008, the Group had drawn down 575.4m 2007: 562.3m from its committed revolving credit facility.
The Group regularly reviews the interest rates to mitigate this risk, which are rebased on a monthly basis and seeks to fix interest rates on a portion of its debt when market conditions make this desirable.
At 30 September 2008, all outstanding debt was held at variable rates.
Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows will fluctuate because of the changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups foreign currency exposures are principally to the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group has US Dollar, Euro and Swiss Franc denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the US, France, Spain, Germany and Switzerland.
The fair value of the US Dollar borrowings at 30 September 2008 was 290.6m 2007: 314.2m, the Euro borrowings 203.5m 2007: 235.9m and Swiss Franc borrowings 13.9m 2007: 11.4m.
The foreign exchange loss of 71.7m 2007: gain of 33.8m on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in exchange reserves.
The Groups other currency exposures comprise only those exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses to be recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures reflect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
At 30 September 2008 and 30 September 2007, these exposures were immaterial to the Group.
Sensitivity analysis as at 30 September 2008 Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings and deposits.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK, US Dollar and Euro interest rates, and US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis assumes reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in LIBOR to be 1%, based on interest rate history.
Similarly, sensitivity to movements in US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates of 10% are shown reflecting changes of reasonable proportion in the context of movement in those currency pairs over the last year.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Consolidated income statement and equity.
2008 2007 Income Equity Equity Income gains losses gains losses gains losses gains losses m m m m LIBOR rate interest rates 1% increase 6.0 6.0 6.1 6.1 LIBOR rate interest rates 1% decrease 6.0 6.0 6.1 6.1 US Dollar Sterling exchange rates 10% increase 8.2 78.2 9.2 63.7 Euro Sterling exchange rates 10% increase 9.2 18.3 7.0 14.6 US Dollar Sterling exchange rates 10% decrease 8.9 86.0 10.2 70.0 Euro Sterling exchange rates 10% decrease 10.1 20.1 7.7 16.1 2008 2007 Total Total The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as follows: m m Not later than one year 0.3 0.1 Later than one year but not more than five years 0.2 0.1 0.5 0.2 Future finance charges on finance leases Present value of finance lease liabilities 0.5 0.2 88 17 Deferred tax Deferred tax has been calculated at 28% 2007: 28% in respect of UK companies being the prevailing corporation tax rate and at the prevailing rates for the overseas subsidiaries.
2008 2007 The movement on the deferred tax account is as shown below: m m At 1 October 5.9 16.3 Acquisition of subsidiary 6.2 8.5 Transfer to current tax liabilities 8.2 Income statement credit 0.7 10.2 Exchange differences 1.8 0.2 Share options 0.2 3.3 At 30 September 21.6 5.9 Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12, Income Taxes during the year are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

ESOS Under the 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, grants are made at an exercise price which approximates to the share price at the date of the grant and are made to senior executives and managers across the Group, as well as to other staff with high potential or to recognise significant achievement or local market practice.
The annual grant is normally made after the preliminary declaration of the annual results.
Under the rules of the ESOS, as amended at the Annual General Meeting in 2005, the annual grant of options to an individual is limited to shares worth up to 300% of base salary.
In practice, annual grants to executive directors are limited to shares under option worth 100% of base salary except in exceptional circumstances, such as a promotion or recruitment or to reflect local market practice.
The performance targets governing the vesting of options are based on stretching EPS growth measured over a fixed three year period from the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
30% of options will vest at the end of the period if the increase in EPS exceeds Retail Prices Index RPI by 15% an average of 5% per year and 100% of those options will vest at that time only if RPI is exceeded in that period by 27% an average of 9% per year.
Between those targets, options will vest on a straight-line basis.
If those targets are not met at the end of the three year period, then no further retesting of the performance criteria will be undertaken and the options will lapse.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

The Sage Group PSP The Performance Share Plan the Plan was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2005.
Annual grants of performance shares will normally be made to executive directors and senior executives across the Group after the preliminary declaration of the annual results.
This Plan is currently operated in conjunction with the ESOS.
Annual awards under the Plan are limited to shares worth up to 150% of base salary.
In practice, annual grants to executive directors are limited to shares worth 100% of base salary except in exceptional circumstances, such as a promotion or recruitment or to reflect local market practice.
The performance shares are subject to performance conditions measuring the Groups total shareholder return TSR against a comparator group of international software and computer services companies.
TSR has been chosen as the performance condition because it helps to align the interests of award holders with shareholders and complements the focus on Group financial results that arises from using EPS under the ESOS and annual bonus plan.
The comparator group for awards made in 2008 comprised the following companies: Adobe Systems Cegid LogicaCMG Oracle ARM Holdings Dassault Systemes Mi cro Focus International Salesforce.
com Autonomy Exact Microsoft SAP Blackbaud Intuit Misys Software AG Cap Gemini Lawson Software MYOB 25% of shares vest for median TSR performance as compared to the comparator group whilst all shares vest for upper quintile top 20% TSR performance.
Between those two points, shares will vest on a straight-line basis.
TSR will be measured over a single three year period from the start of the financial year in which the grant is made to establish whether the criteria have been met and if these criteria are not met on the third anniversary of grant, the performance shares will lapse.
Awards were valued using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model.
The fair value per award granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: January January June March June Grant date 2006 2007 2007 2008 2008 Share price at grant date 2.59 2.72 2.49 2.00 2.21 Exercise price 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Number of employees 81 94 2 118 2 Shares under award 1,989,958 2,347,292 33,000 5,107,983 333,148 Vesting period years 333 33 Expected volatility 32% 24% 22% 25% 27% Award life years 333 33 Expected life years 3 3 3 3 3 Risk free rate 4.2% 5.1% 5.7% 4.0% 5.3% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Fair value per award 1.401 1.478 1.041 1.088 1.254 93 The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.

The acquisition of the Shares was funded by the proceeds of a savings account with a bank or building society.
The original scheme adopted in 1996 continued in accordance with its terms for ten years and expired in February 2006.
A new scheme was approved by the members at the Annual General Meeting held on 2 March 2006.
Eligibility All UK employees, including executive directors, of the Company and its participating subsidiaries who have completed at least one years continuous service and are assessable to employment income tax are eligible to participate in the SAYE Plan.
The directors may offer participation to other employees and may alter the length of service required to qualify to a different period, not exceeding five years.
Employee contributions An employee who wishes to participate in the SAYE Plan will enter into a contract the SAYE contract with a savings body, designated by the directors for the purpose of the SAYE Plan, to make monthly contributions by deduction from their pay of not more than the maximum contribution permitted from time to time by HMRC currently 250.
A tax-free bonus currently equivalent to 1.4x or 4.4x the monthly contribution will be paid on completion of 36 or 60 monthly savings contributions respectively and another tax-free bonus currently 8.4x the monthly contribution including the payment at the end of 60 months will be paid after a further two years if the savings plus the initial bonus are not withdrawn prior to that date.
Exercise price An employee who applies for the grant of an option to acquire Shares will do so at a price the Exercise Price which is determined by the directors but which is not less than the greater of: 80% of the middle market quotation of a Share on the dealing day prior to the date of invitation as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List or, if the directors so decide, 80% of the average of the middle market quotations over the three dealing days prior to the date of the invitation or 80% of the middle market quotations at such other time or times agreed in advance with HMRC, and: In the case of an option over unissued Shares, the nominal value of a Share.
Grant of options Each option is granted over a number of Shares which, when multiplied by the Exercise Price, does not exceed the total monthly contributions plus the bonus payable on the maturity of the SAYE contract.
There will be no payment for the grant of an option.
Invitations to apply for options must be made within a period of 42 days after: Approval of the SAYE Plan by HMRC: or The publication by the Company of its interim or final results each year: or The day after the Companys Annual General Meeting: or Any day on which any change to the savings-related share option schemes legislation is announced or made: or If the directors resolve that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the operation of the SAYE Plan.
94 19 Share-based payments continued Exercise of options In normal circumstances, an option may be exercised at any time within six months following maturity of the SAYE contract, using the proceeds of the SAYE contract and the applicable bonus.
Performance conditions were not included in the fair value calculations.
