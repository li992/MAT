Loans, other borrowings and net debt We manage the capital requirements of the Group by maintaining leverage of the Group within the terms of our debt Facility Agreement.
The Group's objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistently with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the debt-to-profit ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt profit.
Net debt is calculated as total debt as shown in the balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Adjusted profit is defined by lending institutions in our Facilities Agreement.
The terms of the Facilities Agreement require the Group to maintain better than specified consolidated financial ratios for net total debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA as defined in the Facilities Agreement, including a proforma adjustment to the EBITDA for acquisitions of less than one year and EBITDA to net cash interest payable.
These financial ratios have to be prepared for the preceding twelve-month period and reported to the lenders under the Facilities Agreement on a quarterly basis.
