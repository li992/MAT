 The Group operates a number of pension schemes including a defined contribution section within the main scheme.
The assets of the Groups pension schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The trustees of the funds are required to act in the best interest of the funds beneficiaries.
The appointment of schemes trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation.
The Group has a policy that one-half of all trustees, other than the Chairman, are nominated by members of the schemes, including current pensioners.
Defined contribution schemes Pension costs for defined contribution schemes were 1.1 million 2007 0.8 million.
Defined benefit schemes Assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions at 31 March were: 2008 2007 % % Expected return on scheme assets 7.0 6.9 Rate of increase in pensionable pay 4.4 4.0 Rate of increase for present and future pensions 3.4 3.0 Rate used to discount schemes liabilities 6.9 5.4 Inflation 3.4 3.0 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience.
As at 31 March 2008 the mortality assumption uses a scheme-specific medium cohort basis.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 62 on the balance sheet date is projected at: 2008 2007 Male 21.8 23.8 Female 25.3 26.6 The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 62, 20 years after the balance sheet date, is projected at: 2008 2007 Male 23.3 24.5 Female 26.4 27.3 92 Pennon Group Annual Report and Accounts  28.

Expected returns on equity and property investments reflect long-term rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
In conjunction with the trustees and investment advisers, the Group restructured its portfolio of defined benefit pension investments during 2006 07 following a review of strategy.
This led to a new asset allocation structure with the objective of increasing investment returns whilst reducing risk.
The revised asset allocation has three main elements: an increased holding of bonds which are expected to be less volatile than most other asset classes and are a better match for the schemes liabilities a reduction in the proportion of equities, but with fund managers having more freedom in making investment decisions to maximise returns investment of a relatively small proportion of the schemes assets circa 10% in alternative asset classes which give the potential for gaining higher returns property and currency.
Equities held by the scheme are spread between the UK circa 60% and international markets circa 40% excluding emerging markets.
The Group provides retirement benefits to some of its former and approximately 49% of current employees through defined benefit schemes.
The level of retirement benefit is based principally on final annual salary earned in employment.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by using the projected unit credit method which is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
An alternative method of valuation to the projected unit credit method is a solvency basis, which is estimated using the cost of buying out benefits with a suitable insurer.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the schemes liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the on-going liabilities.
The Group estimates the amount required to settle the schemes liabilities at the balance sheet date was approximately 630 million.
