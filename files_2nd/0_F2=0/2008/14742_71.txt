RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Defined benefit schemes The Group has two funded final salary pension schemes which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years.
The future benefit obligations are valued by actuarial methods on the basis of an appropriate assessment of the relevant parameters.
The Company operates one of these schemes, being the Scottish Hydro-Electric scheme.
The Group also has an Employer Financed Retirement Benefit scheme and a Group Personal Pension Plan.
The Group Personal Pension Plan operates on a Money purchase basis and has been arranged with Friends Provident.
The Group matches employee contributions up to a specified limit, in most circumstances this is set at 6%.
The Group may also provide additional contributions of 3% after five and ten years continuous service.
The Keadby Generation Limited KGL pension scheme became part of the Southern Electric pension scheme on 1 February 2006.

The return on equities is 3.5% per annum in excess of the yield on government bonds.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected rate for each asset class over the actual asset allocation at 31 March 2008.
The actual return on plan assets is as follows: Consolidated Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m Actual return on plan assets 12.0 112.7 35.5 53.7
