Other commitments On 6 February 2008, the Group announced the terms of two inter-conditional offers for the entire ordinary share capital of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.
Under the announced offers, the Group will offer 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share tendered.
The offers are subject to certain pre-conditions relating to merger control and regulatory approvals in a number of jurisdictions, including the approval of anti-trust authorities in the European Union, the United States, Australia, Canada and South Africa, and foreign investment authorities in Australia.
Provided the pre-conditions have been satisfied or waived, the Group will be obliged to make the offers on the terms we have announced or terms no less favourable to Rio Tinto shareholders.
