For the majority of the groups financial instruments, quoted market prices are readily available.
However, certain financial instruments, such as unquoted securities, are fair valued using valuation techniques, including reference to the current fair values of instruments that are substantially the same subject to the appropriate adjustments.
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on market conditions and information about the financial instrument.
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgement e. g. interest rates, volatility, estimated cash flows, etc and therefore cannot be determined with precision.
