3 Headline profit measures The Company seeks to present a measure of underlying performance which is not impacted by exceptional items or items considered nonoperational in nature.
This measure of profit is described as headline and is used by management to measure and monitor performance.
The following items have been excluded from the headline measure: exceptional items, including income and expenditure relating to John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation: amortisation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination the amortisation charge is a non-cash item, and the directors believe that it should be added back to give a clearer picture of underlying performance: and other financing gains and losses, which represent the potentially volatile gains and losses on derivatives and other financial instruments which do not fall to be hedge accounted under IAS 39.

The total cost of this restructuring, including redundancy, relocation and consolidation of manufacturing, is considered exceptional by virtue of its size.
It is expected to amount to approximately 48m over the period to 2010, of which 4.5m has been charged in the current year.
In addition, restructuring costs in connection with the integration of Medex amounting to 9.1m have been incurred in the period.
No further costs relating to this restructuring are anticipated.
The operating charge of 49.0m in respect of John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation comprises a 40.0m provision for the expected costs of future asbestos judgments, 5.2m in respect of adverse legal judgments net of insurer contributions previously lodged as collateral and 3.8m arising from movements in the discounting due to changes in US interest rates see note 23.
Period ended 31 July 2007 Restructuring costs in connection with the integration of Medex amounting to 9.0m were incurred in the period.
Impairment of goodwill and other assets includes 8.1m in respect of the impairment of a disposal group John Crane Automotive prior to its eventual sale.
Costs of 12.7m in relation to the proposed joint venture with GE were written off in the light of the decision not to proceed with the joint venture.
John Crane, Inc. commuted certain insurance policies and received 42.9m in cash for the period.
At the same time, a provision of 100.7m in respect of legal defence costs for asbestos cases was established note 23.
The progression of other litigation cases arising in 2007 gave rise to an exceptional charge.
The exceptional charge recognised in 2006 in respect of the class action settlement has now been finalised.
That element of the provision which was surplus was therefore released.

No additional tax liabilities have been recognised because the Group is in a position to control the timing of other temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the future.
Other deferred tax also includes the tax benefits of losses carried forward amounting to 26.7m 2007: 15.4m.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses of 102.2m 2007: 17.9m, due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the law of the various territories in which the losses arise.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below.

The Aerospace operations sold comprised the Aerospace business segment as reported in previous annual reports and accounts plus the US microwave company previously reported in Specialty Other.
The revenue and profit before taxation of the US microwave company in the period ended 31 July 2007 were 32.2m and 7.6m respectively.
As the Aerospace operations represented a separate business segment, the disposal group was treated as a discontinued operation in the 2007 Annual report and accounts.
The post-tax result of the Aerospace operations was disclosed as a discontinued operation in the consolidated income statement.
In the cash-flow statement, the operating cash-flows of the Aerospace Group for the period ended 31 July 2007 were aggregated with those of the continuing operations, but are shown separately in the note below.

81 Smiths Group plc Annual report, year ended 31 July 2008 9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders of the Parent Company by the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Year ended Period ended 31 July 2008 31 July 2007 m m Profit attributable to equity shareholders for the year continuing 244.0 202.9 total 268.5 1,728.1 Average number of shares in issue during the year 387,446,186 549,153,733 Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by 391,851,712 2007: 556,934,401 ordinary shares, being the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period adjusted by the dilutive effect of employee share schemes.
For the year ended 31 July 2008 options over 1,376,331 2007: 847,762 shares were excluded from this calculation because their effect was anti-dilutive for continuing operations.
The average number of shares in issue has reduced as a result of the share consolidation in June 2007 following the disposal of the Aerospace business.
The average number of shares in issue during the period ended 31 July 2007 was a reflection of the capital structure appropriate to both the continuing and the discontinued business.
A reconciliation of basic and headline earnings per share continuing is as follows: Year ended 31 July 2008 Period ended 31 July 2007 EPS EPS m p m p Profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Parent Company 244.0 63.0 202.9 36.9 Exclude exceptional operating items note 4 35.4 98.2 profit on sale impairment of financial asset 24.0 amortisation of acquired intangible assets 19.2 14.8 financing gains charged to administrative expenses 0.3 1.5 exceptional finance cost adjustment to discounted provision note 4 4.7 charged to financing 1.4 2.1 61.0 88.4 less tax 16.3 33.3 44.7 11.5 55.1 10.1 Headline 288.7 74.5 258.0 47.0 Headline EPS diluted p 73.7 46.3 82 Smiths Group plc Annual report, year ended 31 July 2008 Notes to the accounts continued 10 Post-retirement benefits Smiths operates a number of defined benefit plans throughout the world.
The principal schemes are in the United Kingdom and in the United States and assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The Group also provides a defined contribution 401K plan for its US employees.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent,  actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the two principal UK schemes were performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2006.
The most recent valuations of the six principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1 January 2008.
These valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2008.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values.
Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries with the objective that the benefits be fully funded during the scheme members average working lives.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 2008 2007 UK US Other UK US Other Rate of increase in salaries 4.1% 3.8% 3.7% 4.1% 3.8% 3.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.6% n a 1.4% 3.1% n a 1.0% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.5% n a 0.7% 3.1% n a 0.6% Discount rate 6.6% 6.8% 6.0% 5.8% 6.4% 5.1% Inflation rate 3.6% 3.3% 2.5% 3.1% 2.8% 1.6% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% 3.8% 5.0% 2.7% 8% p. a. reducing 0.5% p. a. to 5% in 2014 9% p. a. reducing 1% p. a. to 5% in 2012 The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
For countries outside the UK and USA these are disclosed as a weighted average.
The mortality assumptions used in the UK schemes are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within each scheme.
The assumptions are based on the PA92 birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on the experience of the schemes.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the medium cohort and a 1% underpin.
The assumptions are that a member who retires next year at age 65 will live on average for a further 22 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 25 years if they are female.
For a member who is currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time they are assumed to live on average for a further 23 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 27 years if they are female.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal US schemes are based on the most recent mortality study table produced for retired pensioners in the US RP 2000 table.
The table selected allows for future mortality improvements and applies an adjustment for job classification blue collar versus white collar.
The assumptions are that a member who retires at age 65 will live on average for a further 18 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 20 years after retirement if they are female.
For a member who is currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time they are assumed to live on average for a further 19 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 21 years if they are female.

Sensitivity Valuation of post-retirement schemes involves judgements about uncertain future events.
Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 July 2008 are set out below.
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions such as salary increases.
While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the impacts may offset to some extent.

Value in use calculations are utilised to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill held within each cash generating unit CGU.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash-flows of the CGU in which the goodwill is contained, applying a discount rate based on the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8% adjusted where appropriate for risks specific to the CGU.
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash-flows.
These forecast cash-flows are based on approved budgets and represent a best estimate of future performance.
The goodwill held in the Smiths Medical Critical Care and Smiths Detection Civil CGUs, with net book values of 291.5m 2007: 283.7m and 288.8m 2007: 252.0m respectively, is considered significant in comparison to the total carrying value of goodwill.
Following a reorganisation of the management of the Detection business the allocation of goodwill to CGUs was updated.
The Detection Civil CGU incorporates the business activities reported as Smiths Detection Imaging Systems in 2007.
The comparative net book value has been restated to reflect the new allocation.
The following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash-flow projections for the Critical Care and Detection Civil CGUs: growth rates of 2.25% 2007: 2.00% have been used for the Critical Care and Detection Civil CGUs to extrapolate beyond the most recent forecasts, representing a view of the long-term average growth rates for the industries in which the businesses operate.
The growth rates used to estimate future performance beyond the periods covered by our annual planning and strategic planning processes do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for similar projects and do not reflect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment planning: and in addition to discount rates and long-term growth rates, the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of the Critical Care and Detection Civil CGUs include future sales prices and volumes with reference to specific customer relationships and product lines, operating margins, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise planned productivity improvements.
The assumptions used in the discounted cash-flow forecasts incorporate past performance and historical growth rates and margins achievable in our key markets as a guide.
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that no reasonable changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the Critical Care and Detection Civil CGUs to exceed their respective recoverable amount.
The balance of the goodwill represents smaller individual amounts which have been allocated to specific operating companies and smaller CGUs.
These amounts are tested for impairment at this level.

95 Smiths Group plc Annual report, year ended 31 July 2008 21 Financial risk management The Groups international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks including the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in debt market prices, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Risk management policies are set by the Board.
The treasury policy sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage risk exposures include foreign currency derivatives, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
The central treasury function monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies using regular reports from all the businesses.
The management of operational credit risk is discussed in note 16. a Foreign exchange risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that, when such a sale or purchase is certain or highly probable, the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The net exposure is calculated by adjusting the expected cash-flow for payments or receipts in the same currency linked to the sale or purchase.
This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the transaction will be affected by foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost effective.
At 31 July 2008 the Group had outstanding foreign currency contracts with a nominal value of 130m 2007: 131m which were being used to manage transactional foreign exchange exposures, but were not accounted for as cash-flow hedges.
The following table shows the currency of financial instruments.

In the period ended 31 July 2007 Smiths entered into a one-off hedge contract to fix the sterling equivalent of the projected net proceeds arising from the Aerospace disposal note 7.
This hedge contract had a nominal value of US$4.2 billion, a maturity date of 8 May 2007, and an effective exchange rate of 1.9791.
The gain of 18.5m realised on this contract was recognised in calculating the fair value of the consideration.
96 Smiths Group plc Annual report, year ended 31 July 2008 Notes to the accounts continued 21 Financial risk management continued Based on the assets and liabilities held at the year end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, the change in the fair value of financial instruments not designated as net investment hedges would have the following effect: Gain loss Gain loss Impact on profit recognised in Impact on profit recognised in for the year reserves for the year reserves 31 July 2008 31 July 2008 31 July 2007 31 July 2007 m m m m US dollar 0.1 3.3 1.5 1.7 Euro 4.8 1.0 0.7 2.6 Sterling 2.1 2.8 1.1 2.3 These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax and do not include the effect of intra-group loans which have been designated as quasi-equity.
Cash-flow hedging The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency sales and purchases.
At 31 July 2008 contracts with a nominal value of 222.2m 2007: 211.0m were designated as hedging instruments.
The fair value of the hedging instruments is disclosed in note 22.
The majority of hedged transactions will be recognised in the income statement in the same period that the cash-flows are expected to occur, with the only differences arising as a result of normal commercial credit terms on sales and purchases.
Of the foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments 99% are for periods of 12 months or less 2007: 93%.
The movements in the cash-flow hedge reserve during the period are summarised in the table below: Year ended Period ended 31 July 2008 31 July 2007 m m Brought forward cash-flow hedge reserve at start of period 1.4 13.3 Exchange adjustments 0.2 Gains and losses on effective cash-flow hedges recognised in equity 1.0 4.8 Amounts removed from the hedge reserve and recognised in the following lines on the income statement: Revenue 0.2 2.7 Cost of sales 0.3 1.1 Profit after taxation discontinued operations 15.1 Carried forward cash-flow hedge reserve at end of period 1.1 1.4 97 Smiths Group plc Annual report, year ended 31 July 2008 21 Financial risk management continued Translational currency exposure The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations, particularly in America and Europe.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing either directly in the local currency or indirectly through the use of rolling annual forward foreign exchange contracts.
The table below sets out the currency of loans designated as net investment hedges and cross-currency swap contracts: At 31 July 2008 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 139.6 70.6 210.2 Cross currency swap contracts 371.4 150.6 163.0 57.8 371.4 290.2 233.6 57.8 210.2 At 31 July 2007 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 67.3 67.3 Cross currency swap contracts 255.9 89.5 125.0 41.4 255.9 89.5 192.3 41.4 67.3 The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements.
Based on the hedging instruments in place at the year end a 10% increase in the value of the US dollar while all other market rates remained constant would lead to a fair value loss of 14.9m 2007: 8.2m and a 10% increase in the value of the euro while all other market rates remained constant would lead to a fair value loss of 17.4m 2007: 19.0m.
These movements would be recognised in equity and fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries.
These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax.
Net investment hedges Cross-currency swap contracts for US dollars, Euros, Yen, Renminbi and Canadian dollars with a nominal value of 371m 2007: 238m and foreign currency borrowings of US $277m 2007: $nil and 90m 2007: 100m have been designated as net investment hedges in respect of the currency translation risk arising on foreign operations.
The contracts mature within twelve months.
See note 22 for the fair value of the contracts.
The gains and losses that have been deferred in the net investment hedge reserve are shown in the table below: Year ended Period ended 31 July 2008 31 July 2007 m m Brought forward net investment hedge reserve at start of period 17.2 13.2 Amounts deferred in the period on effective net investment hedges 47.5 8.2 Amounts removed from the hedge reserve and recognised in the income statement 4.2 Carried forward net investment hedge reserve at end of period 30.3 17.2 98 Smiths Group plc Annual report, year ended 31 July 2008 Notes to the accounts continued 21 Financial risk management continued b Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups normal policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 30% to 70% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a three-year horizon.
This is achieved partly through fixed rate borrowings, and partly through the use of interest rate swaps.
Excluding the cash pool gross up, at 31 July 2008 46% 2007: 55% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed interest rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings and cross currency swaps at 31 July 2008, after interest rate swaps, is 4.6% 2007: 5.3%.
Interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities and the fair value of borrowings The following table shows the interest rate risk exposure of cash and borrowings.
The other financial assets and liabilities do not earn or bear interest and for all financial instruments except for borrowings the carrying value is not materially different from their fair value.
Cash and Fair value of Cash and Fair value of cash equivalents Borrowings borrowings cash equivalents Borrowings borrowings 31 July 2008 31 July 2008 31 July 2008 31 July 2007 31 July 2007 31 July 2007 m m m m m m Fixed interest adjusted for interest rate hedging : Less than one year 3.8 4.0 14.1 3.0 3.0 Between one and five years 203.5 207.1 151.1 157.3 Greater than five years 160.1 166.2 207.9 216.8 Total fixed interest financial assets liabilities adjusted for interest rate hedging 367.4 377.3 14.1 362.0 377.1 Floating rate interest financial assets liabilities 122.1 535.7 535.7 165.6 417.2 417.2 Total interest bearing financial assets liabilities 122.1 903.1 913.0 179.7 779.2 794.3 Non-interest bearing assets liabilities in the same category 10.4 9.6 Total 132.5 903.1 913.0 189.3 779.2 794.3 Interest rate hedging The Group has designated US$150m interest rate swaps which mature on 28 January 2013 as fair value hedges on the US private placement which matures on the same date.
This hedges the risk of variability in the fair value of borrowings arising from interest rate fluctuations.
The fair value of the hedging instrument is disclosed in note 22.
The effect of the interest rate swap is to convert 75.7m 2007: 73.7m debt from fixed rate to floating rate.
Sensitivity of interest charges to interest rate movements The Group has exposure to sterling, US dollar and Euro interest rates.
However the Group does not have a significant exposure to interest rate movements for any individual currency.
Based on the composition of net debt and foreign exchange rates at 31 July 2008, and taking into consideration all fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps in place, a one percentage point 100 basis points change in average floating interest rates for all three currencies would have a 4.3m 2007: 3.9m impact on the Groups profit before tax.
c Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Groups Board-approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment graded long-term credit rating for cash deposits, normally at least AAor equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables, totals 132.5m at 31 July 2008 2007: 189.3m.
This includes cash of 100.6m 2007: 123.2m held in interest compensation pools where Smiths has a legal right of set-off and the net pool balance at the year end was a creditor.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits and cash is 12.4m 2007: 27.8m, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for foreign exchange contracts at 31 July 2008 to a single bank is 1.5m 2007: 4.6m.
These banks had credit ratings of AA and AA respectively.

Provision is made for the likely cost of after-sales support based on the recent past experience of individual businesses.
Reorganisation On 3 June 2008 the Company announced a number of changes to its corporate centre and divisional headquarters.
The total cost of this restructuring, including redundancy, relocation and consolidation of manufacturing, is expected to amount to approximately 48m over the period to 2010, of which 4.5m has been charged in the current year.
Reorganisation provisions include 4.7m 2007: 6.0m costs relating to restructuring supply arrangements following the automotive seals disposal.
These costs are expected to be spread over the next six years.
The residual balance at 31 July 2007 related mainly to Medical, and was utilised during 2008.
Property Where a property is vacant, or sub-let under terms such that rental income is insufficient to meet all outgoings, the Group provides for the expected future shortfall up to termination of the lease.
Provision is also made for the cost of reinstatement work on leased properties where there is an obligation under the lease, and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
Where evidence of contamination is found on property in the Groups occupation, provision is made for estimated remedial costs pending action on the affected site.
Most of the balance is expected to be utilised within the next five years.
Disposal A provision has been made in 2008 in respect of obligations arising from the disposal of the Groups Marine Systems business.
See note 30 for details of this disposal.
The terms of the disposal of the Aerospace operations included certain obligations for which provision was made in 2007, including 24.3m in respect of costs of transferring aerospace active pensioners.
In 2008 the pensioners were transferred, utilising 20.7m of this provision.
The balance of 3.6m has been released to the income statement.
102 Smiths Group plc Annual report, year ended 31 July 2008 Notes to the accounts continued 23 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Litigation John Crane, Inc. John Crane, Inc. JCI is one of many co-defendants in litigation relating to products previously manufactured which contained asbestos.
Until 2006, the awards, the related interest and all material defence costs were met directly by insurers.
In 2007, JCI secured the commutation of certain insurance policies in respect of product liability.
While substantial insurance remains in place, JCI has begun to meet defence costs directly, seeking appropriate contribution from insurers thereafter.
Provision is made in respect of the expected costs of defending known and predicted future claims and of adverse judgments in relation thereto, to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
No account has been taken of recoveries from insurers as their nature and timing are not yet sufficiently certain to permit recognition as an asset for these purposes.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases are ones in which the asbestos fibres were encapsulated in such a manner that, according to tests conducted on behalf of JCI, the products were safe.
JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
JCI has resisted every case in which it has been named and will continue its robust defence of all asbestos-related claims based upon this safe product defence.
As a result of its defence policy, JCI has been dismissed before trial from cases involving approximately 159,000 claims over the last 29 years.
JCI is currently a defendant in cases involving approximately 136,000 claims.
JCI has had final judgments against it, after appeals, in only 70 cases, amounting to awards of some US$70m over the 29 year period.
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision include: The periods over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated.
Projections used range between 10 and 20 years.
The future trend of legal costs allowing for 3% cost inflation.
The rate of future claims.
The rate of successful resolution of claims.
The average level of judgments.
The provision is based on past history and allows for decreasing costs based on published tables of asbestos incidence projections.
In the light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos claims, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will be an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to revision from time to time as more information becomes available.
The provision shown in the table above is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period.
The deferred tax asset related to this provision is shown within the deferred tax balance note 6.
Set out below is the gross, discounted and post-tax information relating to this provision: 2008 2007 m m Gross provision 185.9 142.2 Discount 47.0 45.8 Discounted pre-tax provision 138.9 96.4 Deferred tax 37.5 36.6 Discounted post-tax provision 101.4 59.8 Other litigation The Group has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its patents and other business intellectual property rights against infringement, and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provision is made for the expected fees and associated costs, based on professional advice as to the likely duration of each case.
Provisions totalling 2.2m 2007: 8.9m were released relating to litigation settled at less than the expected cost.
Apart from that relating to JCI, none of the other provisions is discounted.
24 Operating lease commitments minimum lease payments The minimum uncancellable lease payments which the Group is committed to make are: 2008 2007 Land and Land and buildings Other buildings Other m m m m Payments due not later than one year 20.5 7.8 17.5 7.3 later than one year and not later than five years 47.0 8.1 43.1 8.0 later than five years 20.3 0.1 24.7 0.1 87.8 16.0 85.3 15.4 103 Smiths Group plc Annual report, year ended 31 July 2008 25 Contingent liabilities and commitments John Crane, Inc. As stated in note 23, John Crane, Inc. JCI is involved in numerous law suits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from exposure to, or use of, products containing asbestos.
Provision has been made for the cost of adverse judgements expected to occur.
The Group anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue beyond the period covered by this provision: however, because of the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of litigation beyond this period, the cost of adverse judgments cannot be reliably estimated.
Other contingent liabilities and commitments At 31 July 2008, contingent liabilities, comprising bonds and guarantees arising in the normal course of business, amounted to 75m 2007: 88m.
The Group is currently co-operating with the relevant authorities in investigating certain allegations of improper business conduct.
Based on the work completed to date, these are not expected to give rise to any material financial exposure.
The Parent Company has arranged two letters of credit to support the Groups pension plans, one for 100.0m and one for 50.0m.
At 31 July 2008, total usage of the two facilities was 124.9m 2007: 132.8m.

The remaining B shares carry annual interest of 75% of 12 month LIBOR, payable in arrears in April.
Smiths may redeem and cancel the remaining B shares up to November 2008 for a consideration of 365p per share in cash or convert them to ordinary shares.
B shares have no voting rights.
In 2007 the Group issued 577.6 million B shares with a nominal value of 5.8m.
4.2m of associated costs were charged to the share premium account.
Of these shares 572.6 million were redeemed on 25 June 2007 for a consideration of 365p per share including 348.2 million B shares which had been converted into deferred shares.
After the allotment of the B shares in 2007 a capital reorganisation was undertaken.
The shareholders received two new 37.5p ordinary shares for every three 25p ordinary shares which they previously held.
At 31 July 2008 all of the issued share capital was in free issue.
All issued shares are fully paid.

The movements in other reserves relate to the recognition of transfers to the capital redemption reserve required following the redemption of the B shares.
The retained earnings include the purchase of Smiths Group plc shares by the Smiths Industries Employee Benefit Trust.
Capital management Capital comprises shareholders equity adjusted for goodwill recognised directly in reserves.
For the period ended 31 July 2008 the average Group capital was 1,728.1m 2007: 1,732.3m.
The capital structure is based on the directors judgement of the balance required to maintain flexibility while achieving an efficient cost of capital.
The Group has a target gearing, calculated on a market value basis, of approximately 20%.
At the balance sheet date the Group had gearing of 18% 2007: 15%.
This generated a weighted average cost of capital of 8% 2007: 9%.
As part of this process the Group maintains its target of a solid investment grade credit rating by monitoring the factors utilised by ratings agencies and evaluating the impact of potential distributions and future funding requirements.
At the 31 July 2008 the Group had a credit rating of BBB Baa2 2007: BBB Baa2 with Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.

Fiberod 2 May 2008, all on behalf of John Crane, Fast Heat 4 February 2008, Allrizon Tongguang 7 May 2008 and Triasx Pty.
Ltd. 1 July 2008 on behalf of Specialty Other.
From the date of acquisition to 31 July 2008, the acquisitions contributed 38.1m to revenue, 5.9m to headline profit before taxation and 1.4m to profit before taxation.
If Smiths had acquired the businesses at the beginning of the financial period, the acquisitions would have contributed 92.4m to revenue and 13.8m to headline profit before tax.
The fair value adjustments in respect of intangible assets are due to the recognition of 43.7m in respect of customer relationships, 18.8m in respect of technology and 12.0m in respect of patents, licenses and trademarks.
Goodwill represents the value of synergies arising from the acquisitions and the acquirees assembled workforces.
The adjustments to current assets and liabilities relate to valuation adjustments and are provisional, based on managements best estimates.
The values set out below are provisional pending finalisation of the fair values attributable, and will be finalised in the year ending 31 July 2009.
Goodwill and other net assets in respect of prior year acquisitions, as previously reported, have been adjusted as a result of finalising their attributable fair values and changes in the estimated value of contingent considerations.
Accordingly, goodwill has increased by 0.5m on one transaction and reduced by 2.2m on another.
The minority interest and assets accounted for using the equity method adjustment represents assets not acquired by Smiths Group plc when a controlling interest in an associate was acquired.
The asset revaluation surplus represents fair value gains and losses on the associates net assets.

The nature of the principal schemes and plans, including general conditions, is set out below: Smiths Group Sharesave Scheme SAYE The SAYE scheme is an HM Revenue & Customs-approved all-employee savings-related share option scheme which is open to all UK employees, including directors, with 12 months service or more.
Participants enter into a contract to save a fixed amount per month of up to 250 in aggregate for three or five years and are granted an option over shares at a fixed option price, set at a 20% discount to market price at the date of invitation to participate.
In the case of five-year savings contracts, participants can elect to delay maturity of the contract until its seventh anniversary.
The number of shares comprising the option is determined by the monthly amount saved and the bonus paid on maturity of the savings contract.
Options granted under the SAYE scheme are not subject to any performance conditions.
Smiths Group US Sharesave Scheme US Sharesave The US Sharesave scheme is a savings-related share appreciation rights scheme which is open to all US employees with 12 months service or more.
Participants enter into a contract to save a fixed amount per month for two years and are granted share appreciation rights based on a fixed initial price determined using the market price and the US dollar exchange rate at the date of invitation to participate.
The number of shares used in the calculation is based on the monthly amount saved and the bonus paid on maturity of the savings contract.
Rights granted under the US Sharesave scheme are not subject to any performance conditions.
Smiths Industries 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 95 ESOS Options granted under the 95 ESOS can only be exercised after three years if a performance requirement, determined by the Remuneration Committee, has been met.
Options granted under the 95 ESOS up to 2001 are subject to performance testing based on total shareholder return of the Group versus the total return of the General Industrials Sector of the FTSE All-Share Index.
Options granted from 2002 are subject to a performance test based on growth in the Groups earnings per share.
If the performance requirement is not satisfied at the end of the third year, the performance period may be extended for up to two further years so that performance is tested over a four-year period at the end of the fourth year and a five-year period at the end of the fifth year.
The performance requirement is that the growth in the Groups normalised earnings per share over the three four five financial years beginning immediately prior to the option grant must exceed the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same period by 3% per annum for options up to one times base salary and by 4% per annum for the excess up to two times base salary.
Executive directors received their final grants of options under the 95 ESOS in October 2003.
From 2004 senior executives, including directors, have received awards under the PSP see below.
Grants under the 95 ESOS continue to be made to other executives.
Smiths Group Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP was introduced in 2004 and replaced the 95 ESOS for executive directors and senior executives.
Conditional awards of up to 1.5 times salary and exceptionally three times salary are granted annually.
The awards will be released following the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent the PSPs performance tests have been met.
One-third of the award is subject to a total shareholder return TSR target relative to other FTSE 100 companies excluding financial companies and investment trusts.
For full vesting, the companys TSR must be at or above the 75th percentile over the three year performance period.
25% of the award will vest if the companys TSR is at median.
Awards will vest on a straightline pro-rata basis between median and 75th percentile.
The remaining two-thirds of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS growth target measured before exceptional items.
Full vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 12% per annum.
25% vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 5% per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between 5% and 12%.
The PSP has been replaced by the VSP see below.
Value Sharing Plan VSP The VSP is a one-off long-term incentive plan approved by the shareholders in July 2008 rewarding executives for value creation at Group and Divisional levels over three-year and four-year periods commencing with the financial year 2008 09.
Corporate participants will be rewarded under the VSP for value creation at a Group level, whereas the executives with divisional responsibilities will be rewarded for value creation within the division for which they are responsible.
For the Group scheme, one-third of the award will depend on the growth in Smiths TSR over and above the median for the companies comprising the FTSE-100 excluding financial services companies and the remaining two thirds of each award will be determined by the growth in internal value in excess of 9.5% a year.
The growth in internal value is calculated as follows: adjusted profit before tax PBT times the ratio of PBT to market capitalisation determined at the date of grant plus net equity cash-flows to shareholders.
The divisional awards will depend on meeting an internal value growth target set for the division in which the participant works.
The participants in the VSP will not be eligible for awards under the Performance Share Plan in 2008 09 or 2009 10.
Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP Under the CIP, as introduced in October 2005, the executive directors and senior executives are able, if invited, to use their after tax bonus or 25% of their basic salary after tax, whichever is the greater, to invest in the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three year period, if the executive is still in office and provided the performance test is passed, he will be awarded matching shares in respect of any invested shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares to be awarded is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus is earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The maximum award will not exceed the value, before tax, of the bonus or salary invested in shares by the executive.
Vesting of matching shares will occur and the matching shares will be released at the end of the three year period if the Groups Return on Capital Employed RoCE over the Performance Period exceeds the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC over the Performance Period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum.
In July 2008 the CIP was amended.
From 2009 participants will be required to invest 50% of their post tax bonus in purchased shares.
The performance conditions have been expanded to include an enhanced performance condition of RoCE exceeding WACC by an average margin of 3% per annum.
If the enhanced performance condition is met, two matching shares will be issued for every purchased share.
