The group enters into operating leases of ships, plant and machinery, commercial vehicles and land and buildings.
Typical durations of the leases are as follows: Years Ships up to 15 Plant and machinery up to 10 Commercial vehicles up to 15 Land and buildings up to 40 The group has entered into a number of structured operating leases for ships and in most cases the lease rental payments vary with market interest rates.
The variable portion of the lease payments above or below the amount based on the market interest rate prevailing at inception of the lease is treated as contingent rental expense.
The group also routinely enters into bareboat charters, time-charters and spot-charters for ships on standard industry terms.
The most significant items of plant and machinery hired under operating leases are drilling rigs used in the Exploration and Production segment.
In some cases, drilling rig lease rental rates are adjusted periodically to market rates that are influenced by oil prices and may be significantly different from the rates at the inception of the lease.
Differences between the rate paid and the rate at inception of the lease are treated as contingent rental expense.
Commercial vehicles hired under operating leases are primarily railcars.
Retail service station sites and office accommodation are the main items in the land and buildings category.
The terms and conditions of these operating leases do not impose any significant financial restrictions on the group.
Some of the leases of ships and buildings allow for renewals at BPs option.
