Retirement benefit obligations The Companys employees are members of the UK defined benefit schemes, details of which are disclosed in note 12 to the Group accounts.
Whilst the Group reports under IFRS, the UK GAAP equivalent figures for the UK schemes would not be significantly different.
As the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the schemes, due mainly to changes in the Groups corporate structure over the years, the Company has accounted as though the schemes were defined contribution schemes and has charged the contributions paid each year to the profit and loss account.
