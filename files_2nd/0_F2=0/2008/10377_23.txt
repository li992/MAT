415 Overview 1641 Operating and financial review 4264 Reports 65110 Financial statements 111112 Shareholder information 113 Glossary Financial statements Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2008 1.
General information Mitchells & Butlers plc the Group is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The Group revalues its freehold and long leasehold land and buildings to fair value, which it reviews at least annually.
Short leasehold properties, fixtures and fittings are held at deemed cost on transition to IFRS less depreciation and impairment provisions, which is also considered by the Group to be a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
Non-current assets held for sale as at 27 September 2008 are held at their carrying value in accordance with the Groups policy or their net realisable value where this is lower.
The Groups policy is to account for land held under both long and short leasehold contracts as operating leases, since it has no expectation that title will pass on expiry of the lease contracts.
With the exception of the above policy which was adopted in 2007 the Groups accounting policies have been applied consistently, although certain exemptions to the retrospective application of IFRS have been made by the Group in accordance with IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling rounded to the nearest million, being the functional currency of the primary economic environment in which the parent and most subsidiaries operate.
The Groups accounting reference date is 30 September.
The Group draws up its financial statements to the Saturday directly before or following the accounting reference date, as permitted by section 223 3 of the Companies Act 1985.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, include property valuations, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairments and pensions.
See Property, plant and equipment, Goodwill and Employee benefits below for further information regarding these areas.
Actual results may differ from estimates.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Mitchells & Butlers plc the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same financial reporting period as the Company.
Where necessary adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arising in respect of acquisitions, being the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value attributed to the separately identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is stated at cost less any impairment in value.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
The impairment review requires management to undertake certain judgements, including estimating the recoverable value of the business to which the goodwill relates, based on either the fair value or the value in use, in order to reach a conclusion as to whether it deems the goodwill to be recoverable.
Value in use estimates are based on managements projection of the cash flows that the business will generate, after applying a suitable discount rate see note 14 Goodwill and other intangible assets for further information.
Fair value is based on managements assessment of the net proceeds which could be generated through disposing of the business to which the goodwill relates.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 30 September 1998 was eliminated against reserves.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, such goodwill remains eliminated against reserves and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill denominated in foreign currencies is translated into sterling at each balance sheet date and any movements are accounted for as set out under Foreign currencies.
ii Computer software Computer software and associated development costs, which are not an integral part of a related item of hardware, are capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight line basis over their useful life.
The period of amortisation ranges between three and 10 years with the majority being five years.
Property, plant and equipment Within property plant and equipment, freehold and long leasehold land and buildings have been revalued as at 27 September 2008 to fair value.
Short leasehold properties, fixtures and fittings are held at deemed cost on transition to IFRS less depreciation and impairment provisions and non-current assets held for sale as at 27 September 2008 are held at their carrying value in accordance with the Groups policy or their net realisable value where this is lower.
Surpluses which arise from the revaluation exercise are recorded directly within the revaluation reserve unless they are reversing a revaluation decrease which has been recognised in the income statement previously: in which case an amount equal to a maximum of that recognised in the income statement previously is recognised in income.
Where the revaluation exercise gives rise to a deficit, this is reflected directly in the revaluation reserve to the extent that a surplus exists against the same asset.
Any residual amount is then recognised against income.
Mitchells & Butlers 69 Annual report and accounts 2008 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2008 continued 1.
General information continued Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold properties are depreciated so that the difference between their carrying value and estimated residual value is written off over 50 years from the date of acquisition.
The residual value of freehold and long leasehold properties is reviewed at least annually and no depreciation is charged where the residual value is estimated to be equal to or exceed the carrying value, so that the depreciation charge would be immaterial.
Leasehold properties are depreciated over the unexpired term of the lease where this is less than 50 years.
The cost less residual value based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date of plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings and equipment is spread by equal instalments over the estimated life of the relevant assets, namely: Equipment in retail outlets 3-20 years Information technology equipment 3-7 years Vehicles 4-5 years Plant and machinery 4-20 years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed each year and adjusted if appropriate.
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an outlet basis for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an outlet exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an outlets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In determining the value in use of an outlet, the Group is required to make various judgements regarding the outlets projected cash flows and the appropriate discount rate to apply to these.
These judgements include estimating the future growth rate and profitability of the outlet.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups When the value of an asset or group of assets will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than continuing use, the assets are reclassified as non-current assets held for sale, or as a disposal group, where the assets are to be sold as a group in a single transaction.
This condition is met when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
The Board of Directors must be committed to the sale and completion should be expected within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups are valued at the lower of book value and fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.
Leases i Operating leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases and sub-leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction in the rental expense over the lease term.
Premiums paid on acquiring a new lease are spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Such premiums are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current prepayments, with the current portion being the element which relates to the following financial period.
ii Finance leases Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Property, plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease are capitalised at the inception of the lease at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance lease obligation and finance charges in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Work in progress is in respect of property development activities and includes the direct costs of the developments and associated professional fees.
Financial instruments i Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at original cost less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
Mitchells & Butlers 70 Annual report and accounts 2008 415 Overview 1641 Operating and financial review 4264 Reports 65110 Financial statements 111112 Shareholder information 113 Glossary Financial statements ii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and other short-term highly liquid deposits with an original maturity at acquisition of three months or less.
Cash held on deposit with an original maturity at acquisition of more than three months is disclosed as current asset investments.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that are integral to the Groups cash management.
iii Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised at original cost.
iv Borrowings Borrowings, which include the Groups secured loan notes, are stated initially at fair value normally, the amount of the proceeds, net of issue costs.
Thereafter they are stated at amortised cost using an effective interest basis.
Finance costs, which are the difference between the net proceeds and the total amount of payments to be made in respect of the instruments, are allocated over the term of the debt using the effective interest method.
v Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses interest rate and currency swap contracts to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and hedge accounting is applied, where the necessary criteria under IAS 39 are met.
It also used inflation swap contracts and gilt hedges during the year to mitigate its anticipated exposure to movements in the retail price index and the value of its fixed rate debt: these contracts were closed out prior to the year end.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of highly probable future cash flows are recognised directly in equity.
The cumulative gain or loss is transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Movements in the fair value of derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point, the cumulative gain or loss in equity remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
vi Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the relevant rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at cost using the exchange rate on the date of the initial transaction.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into sterling at the relevant rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at weighted average rates of exchange for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the results and the retranslation of opening net assets denominated in foreign currencies are taken directly to the Groups translation reserve.
When an overseas operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Revenue Revenue is the value of goods and services sold to third parties as part of the Groups trading activities, after deducting sales-based taxes, coupons and staff discounts.
The majority of revenue comprises food and beverages sold in the Groups outlets.
This revenue is recognised at the point of sale to the customer.
Revenue arising from the sale of development property is recognised on legal completion of the sale.
Tax The income tax expense represents both the income tax payable, based on profits for the year, and deferred tax and is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the income tax is also charged or credited to equity.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount of their tax bases.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Mitchells & Butlers 71 Annual report and accounts 2008 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2008 continued 1.
General information continued Employee benefits i Pension obligations The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit arrangements is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified actuaries.
This is based on a number of financial assumptions, the determination of which is significant to the balance sheet valuation.
These are set out and discussed in note 8 Pensions.
The current service cost, together with the cost of any benefits relating to past service, is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount within finance income or finance expense.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, in the statement of recognised income and expense, rather than the income statement.
For the defined contribution arrangements, the charge against profit is equal to the amount of contributions payable.
ii Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, whereby, subject to meeting any relevant conditions, employees are awarded shares or rights over shares.
The cost of such awards is measured at fair value, excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions, on the date of grant.
The expense is generally recognised over the vesting period and is adjusted for the estimated effect of non market-based vesting conditions and forfeitures, on the number of shares that will eventually vest due to employees leaving the employment of the Group.
Fair values are calculated using a combination of Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo simulation models depending on the conditions attached to the particular share scheme.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment and applied its requirements to only those awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 January 2005.
Own shares The cost of own shares held in employee share trusts and in treasury are deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders equity.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured using the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the year end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Adjusted profit In addition to presenting information on an IFRS basis, the Group also presents information that excludes exceptional items and IAS 39 movements see below.
This information is disclosed to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group and is consistent with the Groups internal management reporting.
Exceptional items, which include profits and losses on disposal of properties, are those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
IAS 39 movements represent movements in the fair value of the Groups derivative financial instruments which are commercially effective but which do not qualify for hedge accounting and are therefore recognised in the income statement.
Adjusted profit excludes exceptional items and the IAS 39 movements.
Exceptional items and IAS 39 movements and the related tax on these are excluded from the calculation of adjusted earnings per share.
Recent accounting developments The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
They have not been adopted early by the Group.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of the new standards or revisions to existing standards will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial adoption and expects that there will be no material impact on reported income or net assets.
IFRS 8 Operating Segmentsreplaces IAS 14 and requires segment information to be presented on the same basis as used for internal reporting purposes.
IFRS 8 is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
Revised IAS 23 Borrowing Coststhe revision, which is effective 1 January 2009, requires costs which are directly attributable to assets that take a substantial period of time before they are ready for use or sale, to be capitalised: previously it was possible to choose whether to capitalise or expense such borrowing costs.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19the limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 and provides guidance on the amount of any pension surplus to be recognised as an asset.
Exchange rates The results of overseas operations have been translated into sterling at the weighted average euro rate of exchange for the financial period of 1 1.31 2007 1 1.48, where this is a reasonable approximation to the rate at the dates of the transactions.
Euro and US denominated Mitchells & Butlers 72 Annual report and accounts 2008 415 Overview 1641 Operating and financial review 4264 Reports 65110 Financial statements 111112 Shareholder information 113 Glossary Financial statements assets and liabilities have been translated at the relevant rate of exchange at the balance sheet date of 1 1.26 2007 1 1.43 and 1 $1.84 2007 1 $2.04 respectively.
Prior year adjustment The Group noted in the 2007 Annual report and accounts that it had recognised a prior year adjustment.
The adjustment related to the deferred tax provision for the future tax payable on the theoretical disposal of all of the Groups land and buildings.
As a result of obtaining more detailed analysis of the tax base cost for individual assets, the Group demonstrated that the deferred taxation provision as at 1 October 2006 was understated by 76m.
In order to correct this understatement the Group increased its deferred taxation provision as at 1 October 2006 by 76m, with a corresponding entry recognised in retained earnings at the same date.
This adjustment was recognised through a prior year adjustment as the understatement represented an error which it would not be appropriate to correct prospectively.
The impact of the adjustment to retained earnings as at 1 October 2006 is included in the Reconciliation of movements in equity note on page 94.
Segmental analysis The Groups primary reporting format is by business segment and its secondary format is by geographic segment.
The Group has two main retail operating segments: Pubs & Bars, focusing primarily on drink and entertainment-led sites, and Restaurants, focusing on food and accommodation-led sites.
The other Group activity is property development which is undertaken by Standard Commercial Property Developments Limited SCPD.
There are no inter-segment sales.

Share-based payments The expense recognised for share-based payments in the year is 4m 2007 8m which comprises share option schemes and share awards.
The Group had six share schemes, all of which are equity-settled, in operation during the year.
The vesting of all awards or options is generally dependent upon participants remaining in the employment of a participating company during the vesting period.
Sharesave Plan The Sharesave Plan is a HMRC approved savings scheme, whereby the proceeds from a savings contract, of either three or five years duration, may be used to purchase shares under option.
Options are typically granted in June or July of each year, at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the date of invitation.
There are no performance conditions.
The scheme is open to all UK employees provided that they have at least one years service at the date of invitation.
The vesting period is 39 months or 63 months and options may be exercised up to six months after the vesting date.
Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan is open to all UK employees with at least 18 months service at the date of award.
The plan awards free shares to participating employees based on salary, up to a maximum award of 3,000 per employee per year.
There is a vesting period of two years as defined in IFRS 2 from the award date.
Shares are generally held in Trust for at least three years and are capable of being released to participants at any time thereafter.
Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan Under the Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan the annual bonuses of the Executive Directors may be deferred into Mitchells & Butlers plc shares with one Matching Share awarded for every Bonus Share.
From the grant in December 2006 participants are also entitled to receive Dividend Accrued Shares on vesting equal to the value of the ordinary dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the performance period.
Matching Shares will only be released in full if the Groups adjusted earnings per share over the three year performance period ending 27 September 2008, exceeds by at least 27%, the increase in the UK Retail Price Index for the same period.
For the grant in December 2006 relating to the 2005 06 bonus year the earnings per share related performance condition still applies in respect of Matching Shares, however, it is now determined with reference to the average adjusted earnings per share growth over the three year performance period exceeding the UK Retail Price Index growth.
All outstanding awards vest three years after the award date and shares are transferred to participants on vesting.
No award was granted relating to the 2006 07 bonus year due to the loss suffered by the Company from the hedge closure.
All deferrals of bonuses into shares to date have been entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Performance Restricted Share Plan The Performance Restricted Share Plan allows Executive Directors and other eligible employees to receive nominal cost options, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, set by the Remuneration Committee, which are normally measured over a three-year period.
Vesting is conditional upon the achievement of total shareholder return TSR and cash return on cash capital employed CROCCE performance conditions.
The vesting period for these options is generally three years followed by a two year exercise period.
In respect of the TSR performance condition, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to incorporate the market condition in the measurement of the fair value.
For all grants from 2005 06 onwards, participants will be entitled to receive Dividend Accrued Shares on vesting equal to the value of the ordinary dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the performance period.
Mitchells & Butlers 75 Annual report and accounts 2008 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2008 continued 7.
Share-based payments continued Executive Share Option Plan The grant of options under the Executive Share Option Plan was discontinued following shareholder approval of changes to Executive Director remuneration in 2006.
The last grant of options under this plan was made in June 2005.
The option prices were set at an amount not less than the average market value of a share over the three business days immediately prior to the date of grant.
The vesting period for these options is three years from grant, followed by a seven year exercise period.
Rolled-over options Under the terms of the separation in 2003, holders of options under the Six Continents Executive Share Option Schemes were given the opportunity to exchange their Six Continents PLC options for equivalent value new options over Mitchells & Butlers plc shares.
The exchanged options are not subject to performance conditions and were immediately exercisable.
The latest possible exercise date for any of the Rolled-over options outstanding at 27 September 2008, is 28 May 2012.
Further details of the above schemes are included in the Remuneration report on pages 52 to 63.
The following tables set out awards and options granted during 2008.
No options under the Executive Share Option Plan or Rolled-over options were granted during the period and no award was made under the Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan during the period, as noted above.
Performance Share Restricted Sharesave Incentive 2008 Share Plan Plan Plan a Number of shares options awarded 4,092,648 1,979,109 469,004 a Options granted are shown net of immediate lapses The Group has used separate option pricing models and assumptions for each plan.
The following tables set out weighted average information about how the fair value of each option grant was calculated: Performance Restricted Sharesave 2008 Share Plan Plan Monte Carlo Simulation and Valuation model Binomial Black-Scholes Weighted average share price 210.0p 221.5p a Exercise price 259.0p b Expected dividend yield 3.10% Risk-free interest rate 5.23% 5.21% c Volatility 34.0% 34.0% d Expected life years 2.44 3.95 Performance Restricted Sharesave 2007 Share Plan Plan Monte Carlo Simulation and Valuation model Binomial Black-Scholes Weighted average share price 685.0p 869.5p a Exercise price 711.0p b Expected dividend yield 1.80% Risk-free interest rate 4.78% 5.19% c Volatility 24.0% 24.0% d Expected life years 3.0 3.79 a The exercise price relating to the Performance Restricted Share Plan is 1 per participating employee per exercise b The expected dividend yield input for the grant of Performance Restricted Share Plan options in 2007 and 2008 is zero as participants are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of the ordinary dividends paid during the vesting period c The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price commensurate with the expected term of the options and share awards.
Where insufficient share price data is available, competitor share price volatility data over a longer period equal to the expected life of the option or share award is considered.
d The expected term of the options is taken to be the midpoint between vesting and lapse, except for the Performance Restricted Share Plan where the terms of the plan resulted in it being advantageous for participants to exercise directly after vesting.
In this case the expected life has been assumed to equate to the vesting period.
The fair value of awards under the Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan is equal to the share price on the date of award as there is no price to be paid and employees are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares.
The assumptions set out above are therefore not relevant to this scheme.
There was no award under the Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan in 2008 as the Executive Directors bonuses for the 2006 07 year were forgone due to the loss suffered on the hedge closure.

Pensions Retirement and death benefits are provided for eligible employees in the United Kingdom principally by the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan MABPP and the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan MABEPP.
These plans are funded, HMRC approved, occupational pension schemes with defined contribution and defined benefit sections.
The defined benefit sections of the plans closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements.
The defined benefit liability relates to these funded plans, together with an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement the Executive Top-Up Scheme, or MABETUS in respect of certain MABEPP members.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
The valuations used for IAS 19 purposes are based on the results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2007 and updated by the schemes qualified actuaries to 27 September 2008.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 27 September 2008 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
As the defined benefit sections of the pension plans are now closed to new members, the current service cost as calculated under the projected unit method will increase as members approach retirement.
In the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2008, the Group paid regular contributions of 16m 2007 10m and additional contributions of 24m 2007 40m in respect of the defined benefit arrangements.
In addition the Group paid 2m 2007 1m in respect of the defined contribution arrangements.
The results of the 2007 actuarial valuation showed a funding deficit using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme liabilities than is required by IAS 19 and on 23 April 2008 the Company formally agreed a recovery plan with the Trustees to close the funding deficit in respect of its pension scheme liabilities.
The result of this is that the Group has made additional contributions of 24m during the current financial year of which 20m represented the final instalment of the previously agreed schedule of contributions and will make further additional contributions of 24m in each of the financial years from 2009 to 2017, subject to review following the next actuarial valuation at 31 March 2010.
Employer contribution rates to the defined benefit arrangements for the 52 weeks ending 26 September 2009 are 24.2% for the MABPP and 48.5% for the MABEPP.
Based on these contribution rates, it is estimated that total contributions in the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2009 will be 40m, comprising regular contributions of 16m, including 2m payable in respect of the defined contribution arrangements and additional contributions of 24m.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
Mitchells & Butlers 78 Annual report and accounts 2008 415 Overview 1641 Operating and financial review 4264 Reports 65110 Financial statements 111112 Shareholder information 113 Glossary Financial statements The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 a a Wages and salaries increases 5.0% 4.9% 4.4% 4.3% 4.3% Pensions increases 3.5% 3.4% 2.9% 2.8% 2.8% Discount rate 6.5% 5.9% 5.0% 5.0% 5.5% Inflation rate 3.5% 3.4% 2.9% 2.8% 2.8% a For MABPP members 6.0% for MABEPP members 2007 5.9%.
Includes allowance for promotional salary increases.
The discount rate applied to the pension schemes liabilities is significant to the net balance sheet valuation of the schemes and is subject to a high degree of judgement and complexity.
It is estimated that a 0.1% increase or decrease in this rate would, in isolation, reduce or increase the net balance sheet deficit by approximately 20m, with no impact on the income statement charge.
Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on the PA92 year of birth standard tables with allowance for medium cohort projections, with ages rated up by two years for non-retired members of the MABPP, by three years for current pensioners and rated down by two years for members of the MABEPP.
The mortality assumptions adopted have been updated to allow for improvements in life expectancies, taking into account an analysis of the recent experience of the plans.
A summary of the average life expectancies assumed is as follows: 2008 2007 Main plan Exec plan Main plan Exec plan years years years years Male member aged 65 current life expectancy 19.4 23.6 19.4 23.6 Male member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 21.2 24.8 21.2 24.8 Female member aged 65 current life expectancy 22.2 26.5 22.2 26.5 Female member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 24.0 27.7 24.0 27.7 To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was weighted based on the asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio, resulting in a weighted average assumption of 6.1% 2007 6.1%.
The 2006 weighted average expected return was 6.3% comprising: equities 7.5%: bonds 4.6%: properties 7.5%.
The actual investment return achieved on the scheme assets over the year was 5.4 % 2007 9.1%, which represented a loss of 71m 2007 gain of 83m.
The long-term rates of return on assets at 27 September 2008 shown below form the basis of the calculation of the expected return on pension scheme assets for the 2008 financial year.
The 2007 rates shown are used in calculating the 2008 expected return.
The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP, their expected rates of return and the value of the pension scheme assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date can be summarised as follows: 2008 2007 Long-term Long-term rates rates of return of return expected Value expected Value %m % m Equities 8.2 359 7.9 345 Bonds 5.3 814 5.9 854 Property 8.2 38 7.9 93 Fair value of assets 1,211 1,292 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,234 1,310 Deficit in the schemes recognised as a liability in the balance sheet 23 18 Associated deferred tax asset 65 The following amounts relating to the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements have been recognised in the Group income statement and Group statement of recognised income and expense: 2008 2007 Group income statement m m Operating profit: Current service cost defined benefit plans 13 13 Current service cost defined contribution plans 2 1 Charge to operating profit 15 14 Finance income: Expected return on pension scheme assets 79 74 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 76 63 Net finance income in respect of pensions 311 Total charge 12 3 Mitchells & Butlers 79 Annual report and accounts 2008 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2008 continued 8.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 26 September 2004.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS has been calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the financial period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held in treasury and by employee share trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Earnings per ordinary share amounts are presented before exceptional items see note 9 and the IAS 39 movements see note 10 in order to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill relates entirely to the German business, which is also the non-UK reportable segment.
This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
In prior periods, the impairment review has been based on the estimated value in use of the German business to the Group.
Value in use has been calculated with reference to current year cash flows, applying a steady 1.5% growth rate to revenues, based on the long-term estimated inflation rate for the German market and applying current margins.
The discount rate used in the prior year to calculate value in use was derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks relating to the German business.
Following the conclusion of the strategic review in May 2008 that the Group would seek to create additional value from the German business, the Group has deemed it appropriate to value the business based on its estimated arms length market value as at 27 September 2008.
Accordingly, it has fully provided for impairment against the goodwill associated with the business, as it does not anticipate that the market value would be sufficient to recover the goodwill carrying value.

Short leasehold properties and fixtures, fittings and equipment are held at deemed cost at transition to IFRS less depreciation and impairment, which is also considered by the Group to be a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
Non-current assets held for sale are held at their carrying value in accordance with the Groups policy or their net realisable value where this is lower.
The Group accounts for long leasehold land as an operating lease.
The freehold and long leasehold land and buildings were valued at market value, as at 27 September 2008 and 29 September 2007 by Colliers CRE plc, independent chartered surveyors and by Andrew Cox MRICS, Director of Property, Chartered Surveyor.
The valuation was carried out in accordance with the provisions of RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards The Red Book assuming each asset is sold as part of the continuing enterprise in occupation individually as a fully operational trading entity.
The market value has been determined having regard to factors such as current and future projected income levels, taking account of the location, the quality of the pub or restaurant and recent market transactions in the sector.
Changes in these assumptions such as the valuation basis applied in comparable market transactions, or the income level generated by a pub could materially impact the valuation of the freehold and long leasehold land and buildings.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets with a net book value of 3,974m 2007 4,321m, which are pledged as security for the securitisation debt and over which there are certain restrictions on title.
On 19 September 2008, the Group announced that it had completed a deal to exchange 21 of its hotels these were included within the Restaurants operating segment, see note 3, segmental analysis, until the date of completion for 44 individual pub restaurants owned by Whitbread PLC.
The hotels, which were carried at net book value of 78m are included within disposals above.

Securitised debt On 13 November 2003, a group company, Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc, issued 1,900m of secured loan notes in connection with the securitisation of the majority of the Groups UK pubs and restaurants business owned by Mitchells & Butlers Retail Ltd.
The funds raised were mainly used to repay existing bank borrowings of 1,243m, pay issue costs of 23m and return 501m to shareholders by way of a special dividend.
Mitchells & Butlers 86 Annual report and accounts 2008 415 Overview 1641 Operating and financial review 4264 Reports 65110 Financial statements 111112 Shareholder information 113 Glossary Financial statements On 15 September 2006 Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc completed the issue of 655m of further secured loan notes in the form of the A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes as detailed below.
These were issued under substantially the same terms as the original securitisation in November 2003.
The funds raised were mainly used to return 486m to shareholders by way of a special dividend and to provide long-term funding for the Whitbread pub restaurant sites acquired.
As part of the issue, the original A1 and A3 loan note tranches were repaid and reissued as A1N and A3N loan notes to take advantage of market rates.
At 27 September 2008 the loan notes consisted of 10 tranches as follows: Initial Effective principal interest Principal outstanding borrowed Principal repayment period rate at 27 September 2008 Expected c Tranche m Interest all by instalments % m WAL b A1N 200 Floating 2011 to 2028 5.69 200 2 years A2 550 Fixed5.57% 2003 to 2028 6.01 429 8 years a b a A3N 250 Floating 2011 to 2028 5.92 250 2 years b A4 170 Floating 2016 to 2028 5.24 170 5 years b AB 325 Floating 2020 to 2032 5.25 325 5 years B1 350 Fixed5.97% 2003 to 2023 6.12 291 6 years B2 350 Fixed6.01% 2015 to 2028 6.12 350 16 years C1 200 Fixed6.47% 2029 to 2030 6.57 200 21 years b C2 50 Floating 2033 to 2034 5.44 50 5 years b D1 110 Floating 2034 to 2036 5.50 110 5 years a a 2,555 2,375 At 29 September 2007 the loan notes consisted of 10 tranches as follows: Initial Effective principal interest Principal outstanding borrowed Principal repayment period rate at 29 September 2007 Expected c Tranche m Interest all by instalments % m WAL b A1N 200 Floating 2011 to 2028 5.69 200 3 years A2 550 Fixed5.57% 2003 to 2028 6.01 456 9 years a b a A3N 250 Floating 2011 to 2028 5.92 250 3 years b A4 170 Floating 2016 to 2028 5.24 170 6 years b AB 325 Floating 2020 to 2032 5.25 325 6 years B1 350 Fixed5.97% 2003 to 2023 6.12 305 7 years B2 350 Fixed6.01% 2015 to 2028 6.12 350 17 years C1 200 Fixed6.47% 2029 to 2030 6.57 200 22 years b C2 50 Floating 2033 to 2034 5.44 50 6 years b D1 110 Floating 2034 to 2036 5.50 110 6 years a a 2,555 2,416 a Includes the fair value impact of 22m 2007 45m in respect of the currency swaps b After the effect of interest rate swaps c The expected remaining weighted average life WAL is based on the amortisation profile of the individual note tranches calculated on the basis of the refinancing of the notes on the margin step-up dates.
The Group has an unconditional right to continue to hold the individual note tranches through to their final maturity dates however.
The margin step-up dates as at 27 September 2008 are set out below.
The notes are secured on the majority of the Groups property and future income streams therefrom.
All of the floating rate notes are fully hedged using interest rate swaps which fix the interest rate payable.
Interest and margin is payable on the floating rate notes as follows: Tranche Interest Margin Margin step-up date Post step-up margin A1N 3 month LIBOR 0.18% December 2010 0.45% A3N 3 month $ LIBOR 0.18% December 2010 0.45% A4 3 month LIBOR 0.23% September 2013 0.58% AB 3 month LIBOR 0.24% September 2013 0.60% C2 3 month LIBOR 0.75% September 2013 1.88% D1 3 month LIBOR 0.85% September 2013 2.13% The overall cash interest rate payable on the loan notes is 5.7% after taking account of interest rate hedging and the cost of the provision of a financial guarantee provided by Ambac in respect of the Class A and AB notes.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers Retail Ltd, the Groups main operating subsidiary.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other group companies.
At 27 September 2008, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Ltd had cash and cash equivalents of 118m 2007 91m which were governed by the covenants associated with the securitisation.
Of this amount 14m 2007 9m, representing disposal proceeds, was held on deposit in a secured account restricted cash.
The use of this cash requires the approval of the securitisation trustee and may only be used for certain specified purposes such as capital enhancement expenditure and business acquisitions.

Borrowings continued The carrying value of the securitised debt in the Group balance sheet at 27 September 2008 is analysed as follows: 2008 2007 m m Principal outstanding at beginning of period 2,371 2,429 Principal repaid during the period 41 39 Exchange on translation of dollar loan notes 23 19 Principal outstanding at end of period 2,353 2,371 Deferred issue costs 18 20 Accrued interest 45 Carrying value at end of period 2,339 2,356 At 27 September 2008 the Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities: 2008 2007 a Undrawn committed borrowing facilities m m Unutilised facilities expire: Within one year Between two and five years 86 108 86 108 a In addition to the undrawn amounts against the 600m term and revolving credit facility the Group holds a 295m liquidity facility against the securitised loan notes, which is not available for any other purpose On 28 September 2006 the Group entered into a three year 300m revolving credit facility for general business purposes which incurred interest at LIBOR plus a margin.
On 21 November 2007, Mitchells and Butlers plc entered into a further 400m facility expiring on 28 September 2009 which was used to fund the settlement of the derivative financial transactions relating to the aborted property joint venture.
On 24 July 2008 the Group entered into a three year 600m term and revolving credit facility expiring on 30 November 2011, including a 300m revolving credit facility, for general business purposes which incurs interest at LIBOR plus a margin.
The facility has been set at 600m initially, reducing to 550m from December 2008, 400m from December 2009 and 300m by December 2010.
The drawings against the original 300m revolving credit facility and 400m facility were repaid using the proceeds of the new 600m medium-term facility and these facilities were cancelled.
As at 27 September 2008 the Group had drawn an amount of 504m net of deferred issue costs against the 600m facility which forms part of the Other borrowings balance.
Financial instruments Financial risk management Financial risk management is the responsibility of the Groups treasury function.
The Groups treasury function is governed by a Board Treasury Policy Statement which details the key objectives and policies for the Groups treasury management.
The Treasury Committee ensures that the Treasury Policy is adhered to, monitors its operation and agrees appropriate strategies for recommendation to the Board.
The Treasury Policy Statement is reviewed at least annually, with recommendations for change made to the Board, as appropriate.
The Group treasury function is operated as a cost centre and is the only area of the business permitted to transact Treasury deals.
It must also be consulted on other related matters such as the provision of guarantees or the financial implications of contract terms.
An explanation of the Group's financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the discussion of the Treasury Policy Statement on page 30 in the Operating and financial review.
The main financial risks which impact the Group result from Funding and liquidity risk, Credit risk and Market risk, principally as a result of changes in interest and currency rates.
These are discussed further below.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage Market risk.
Funding and liquidity risk In order to ensure that the Groups long-term funding strategy is aligned with its strategic objectives, on a semi-annual basis the Treasury Committee assesses the maturity profile of the Groups debt, alongside the prevailing financial projections and three year plan.
This enables it to ensure that funding levels are appropriate to support the Groups plans.
The current funding arrangements of the Group consist primarily of the securitised notes issued by Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc and associated liquidity facility and the 600m medium-term funding facility drawn by Mitchells & Butlers Retail No 2 Ltd. Further information regarding these arrangements is included in note 20.
The terms of both the securitisation and the medium-term facility contain a number of financial covenants.
Compliance with these covenants is monitored by Group treasury.
The Group prepares a rolling daily cash forecast covering a six week period and an annual cash forecast by period.
These forecasts are reviewed on a daily basis and used to manage the investment and borrowing requirements of the Group.
A combination of cash pooling and zero balancing agreements are in place to ensure the optimum liquidity position is maintained.
Committed facilities outside of the securitisation are sized to ensure that the Group can meet its medium-term anticipated cash flow requirements.

These activities expose the Group to credit risk against the counterparties.
To mitigate this exposure, Group Treasury operates policies that restrict the investment of surplus funds and the entering into of derivative transactions to counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A long term and A1 P1 short term.
The amount that can be invested or transacted at various ratings levels is also restricted under the policy.
To minimise credit risk exposure against individual counterparties, investments and derivative transactions are entered into with a range of counterparties.
The Group Treasury function reviews credit ratings, as published by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, current exposure levels and the maximum permitted exposure at given credit ratings, for each counterparty on a daily basis.
Exceptions are formally reported to the Treasury Committee on a four-weekly basis.
The Groups credit exposure as at 27 September 2008 was: 2008 2007 m m Bank and cash 97 90 Derivative financial instruments 17 a Other receivables 56 39 a The Group may have a right of offset against certain amounts held within this balance Capital risk The Groups capital management is driven by the impact on shareholders of the level of total capital employed.
It is the Groups policy to maintain a sound capital base to support the continued development of its business.
Market risk The Group is exposed to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of its financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Currency risk The Group faces currency risk in two main areas: US$418.75m of Class A3N floating rate notes which form part of the securitised debt see note 20.
At issuance of the notes, the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to manage the foreign currency exposure resulting from both the US$ principal and interest elements of the notes.
The Group has no significant profit and loss exposure as a result of retranslating monetary assets and liabilities at different exchange rates.
As the Group is predominantly UK-based it has no significant currency exposure from its operations.
Mitchells & Butlers 89 Annual report and accounts 2008 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 27 September 2008 continued 21.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Group has a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt instruments and manages the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates by using derivative financial instruments.
Where the necessary criteria are met, the Group minimises the volatility in its financial statements through the adoption of the hedge accounting provisions permitted under IAS 39.
The interest rate exposure resulting from the Groups 2.4bn securitisation is fixed, either as a result of the notes themselves being issued at fixed interest rates, or through a combination of floating rate notes against which 100% effective interest rate swaps are held, which are eligible for hedge accounting.
The Groups medium-term facilities totalling 600m are held at floating interest rates based on LIBOR.
These facilities are economically hedged in part through interest rate swaps, with an initial notional principal amount of 225m, although these do not qualify for hedge accounting and movements in their mark-to-market values are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis point movement in interest rates is detailed below: 2008 2007 Sensitivity to 100bps increase in interest rates m m m a Interest income 2 b Interest expense 5 2 Derivative financial instruments fair values c Profit before tax 43 187 d Total equity 81 82 a Represents interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents these are defined in note 28 b The element of interest expense which is not matched by payments and receipts under cash flow hedges see below which would otherwise offset the interest rate exposure of the Group c The impact on Group Profit Before Tax in respect of derivative financial instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting see below resulting from movements in the fair value of the derivatives d d The impact on Equity from movements in the fair value of cash flow hedges see below Derivative financial instruments Cash flow hedges At 27 September 2008, the Group held 10 2007 10 interest rate swap contracts with a nominal value of 1,105m 2007 1,105m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of 1,105m 2007 1,105m of the Groups floating rate borrowings, comprising the A1N, A3N, A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes.
The cash flows occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a fixed rate of 4.8938% 2007 4.8938%.
The contract maturity dates match those of the hedged item.
The 10 interest rate swaps above are held on the balance sheet at fair market value, which is a liability of 11m 2007 36m asset.
At 27 September 2008 the Group held one 2007 one cross currency interest rate swap contract, with a nominal value of 250m 2007 250m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate and currency risk of 250m 2007 250m of the Groups A3N floating rate $418.75m borrowings.
The cross currency interest rate swap is held on the balance sheet at a fair value liability of 28m 2007 48m liability.
The cash flows occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on US$ LIBOR and paying a fixed rate, in sterling, of 5.4445% 2007 5.4445%.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised directly in the hedging reserve in equity to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The cash flow hedges detailed above have been assessed as being highly effective during the financial period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
During the period a loss of 20m 2007 55m gain on cash flow hedges was recognised directly in equity.
A gain of 30m 2007 15m loss was removed from equity and included in the Group income statement for the period.
Derivative financial instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting The Group announced on 21 May 2007 its intention to form a property joint venture with R20 Ltd.
In the final stage of the planned transaction, the Group and R20 Ltd separately entered into a number of derivative transactions which were intended to be contributed to the joint venture.
Their purpose was to fix the variable cash flows resulting from the inflation linked rental payments receivable by the proposed property joint venture and the LIBOR linked interest payments on the new debt, as well as to insulate the Group from movements in the fair value of its fixed rate debt.
These instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting as defined in IAS 39.
Movements in their fair values were therefore recognised directly in the Group income statement, within exceptional finance costs.
Mitchells & Butlers 90 Annual report and accounts 2008 415 Overview 1641 Operating and financial review 4264 Reports 65110 Financial statements 111112 Shareholder information 113 Glossary Financial statements On 29 January 2008, the Group announced that following the deterioration in the mark-to-market deficit on the hedges and with no near term prospect of debt markets permitting a property-based transaction, it had closed out in cash the hedges no longer required an element of the interest rate swaps was retained as a commercial hedge against the Groups core debt see below, at a cost of 274 m after tax.
The pre-tax cost of closing out the hedges no longer required, which was also the mark-to-market deficit at that time, was 386 m. The total fair value movement of the instruments closed out, during the period to January 2008 when they were settled, was 182 m 2007 204 m, reported within exceptional finance costs.
The instruments which were closed out, along with their fair value at the point of settlement in January 2008 comprised: interest rate swaps with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 5.2152% and a weighted average fair value of 185 m 2007 84 m : gilt hedges with a combined notional principal of 1,385m and a fair value of 87m 2007 34m, and inflation swaps, which carried an annual fixed increase of 3.1775% and paid a variable cash flow based on annual increases in the Retail Price Index, with a fair value of 288 m 2007 154 m. A more detailed description of the instruments is included in the 2007 Annual report and accounts.
The Group continues to hold interest rate swaps with an initial notional principal of 225m and a maturity date of 15 September 2037, as a commercial hedge against part of its 600m three year medium-term facility, which swap the LIBOR based floating interest rate on the facility into a fixed rate of 5.4770%.
These swaps do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting and movements in their fair value are therefore recognised directly in the Group income statement, under the heading IAS 39 movements, within finance costs.
The swaps had a fair value of 41 m 2007 17 m as at 27 September 2008 and include a mandatory early termination and settlement provision, effective on 15 December 2010, subject to extension by mutual agreement between the parties.
Cash flows under the above interest rate swaps are payable and receivable on a quarterly basis.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are reflected on the balance sheet as follows.
These values were measured at 27 September 2008 and may be subject to material movements in the period subsequent to the balance sheet date.

These inflation swaps were closed out in January 2008 following the Boards conclusion that there was no near term prospect of debt markets permitting a property-based transaction.
As these instruments have been closed out during the current financial year there is no sensitivity at 27 September 2008.
The maximum exposure of these derivatives to movements in inflation rates during the period that they were held by the Group was 288m.

As the securitised debt is traded on an active market, the market value represents the fair value of this debt.
The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group could expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.
These amounts are based on quotations from counterparties which approximate to their fair market value and take into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or book values approximate to fair values.
