Deferred tax has not been provided on approximately 196.9m of unremitted earnings of the Groups overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups policy is to retain profits in such overseas subsidiaries in circumstances where a distribution would generate a tax cost in the UK.
Profits will only be repatriated where it is assessed that any liability that would otherwise arise will be substantially covered by foreign tax credits.
During 2008 52.0m of profits arising overseas were repatriated, without giving rise to any UK tax.
