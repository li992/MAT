The method was revised during the 2007 financial year as the Group considered that it was more appropriate to assume that it would recover the carrying amount of its investment properties through use followed by eventual disposal.
This is evidenced by the decision taken in 2007 to dispose of a significant proportion of the portfolio, completed during 2008.
Prior to the 2007 financial year, the Group had been predominantly long-term investors in property with occasional disposals, and it was therefore more appropriate to determine the tax base as being that of returning value through continued collection of rental income.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through the future taxable profits is probable.
At 31 December 2008 the Group did not recognise deferred income tax assets of 292 thousand 2007: 7,438 thousand in respect of losses amounting to 1,042 thousand 2007: 21,186 thousand that can be carried forward against future taxable income or gains in those entities.
The majority of deferred tax assets recognised within the other category relate to deferred tax on swaps held at a loss.
Currently, losses recognised as deferred tax assets have no restrictions on being carried forward.

d Loan covenants A loan between Endicott Sweden AB Endicott and Danske Bank for 25,438 thousand SEK291.2 million contains an equity to assets ratio covenant that was in breach at year end due to a late fall in the net asset value of Catena AB which is Endicotts only investment.

A scheduled repayment of 8,482 thousand SEK97.1 million was made in January 2009 which rectified the covenant breach.
Other loan covenant breaches relate to loans with a principal of 1,400 thousand.

Loans totalling 33,674 thousand in breach at 31 December 2007 were rectified in 2008.

The fair value of current borrowings approximates to the carrying value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.
