The income statement charge in respect of the Incentive Plan and the Performance Share Plan has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as these schemes are subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance target.
The income statement charge in respect of the SAYE scheme is calculated using a binominal option pricing model.
The total income statement charge in respect of these share-based payments is 2.1m 2007: 0.9m.
The income statement charge in respect of the Exchange Scheme is equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of award share price at date of award adjusted for dividends.
All awards will be equity settled.
The total income statement charge in respect of these share-based payments is nil 2007: 0.8m.
The 2007 cost was included within exceptional demerger costs.
In 2007 a charge of 1.6m was charged to the income statement in respect of an accelerated charge for share options over shares in Provident Financial plc which had been granted to Group employees and which became exercisable on demerger and a charge of 0.2m was made in respect of share options over shares in Provident Financial plc prior to demerger.
The fair value per award granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the share-based payment charge are as follows: Incentive Performance Exchange SAYE Plan Share Plan Scheme Scheme Grant date 20 July 2007 20 July 2007 20 July 2007 02 April 2008 Share price at award date 2.50 2.50 2.50 2.28 Base price for TSR 2.26 2.26 n a n a Exercise price nil nil nil 1.88 Share awards outstanding n a 1,951,129 357,626 288,278 Vesting period years 3-4 3-4 2 3, 5 and 7 Expected volatility 30.0% 30.0% n a 30.0% Award life years 3 3 2 Up to 7 Expected life years 3 3 2 Up to 7 Risk-free rate 5.7% 5.7% n a 5.7% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 2.8% 2.8% 2.8% 2.8% Deferred portion 50.0% 50.0% n a n a TSR threshold 30.0% 30.0% n a n a TSR maximum target n a 60.0% n a n a Fair value per award n a 1.10-1.13 2.40 0.68-0.85 No exercise price is payable in respect of awards made under the Incentive Plan, Performance Share Plan and Exchange Scheme.
As IPF plc shares have only been publicly traded since the date of demerger 16 July 2007 the expected volatility is based on the three-year volatilities of comparable companies.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.
For the Performance Share Plan the maximum number of shares that will be awarded is 1,951,129 assuming the 60% TSR target is met, for the Incentive Plan there is no maximum number of shares.
For both the Performance Share Plan and the Incentive Plan the fair value has been calculated based on an estimate of the amount of shares likely to vest.
Further detail in respect of the Incentive Plan, Performance Share Plan, Exchange Scheme and SAYE scheme is given in the directors remuneration report.
