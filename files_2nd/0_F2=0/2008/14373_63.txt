Financial Instruments and Risk Management ForeignExchange Exposures The Group operates in 32 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure.
The Groups policy is to limit the impact of foreign exchange movements on equity by holding liabilities in the same currencies as the Groups non US Dollar assets.
These liabilities take the form of either borrowings or currency swaps.
The Group designates a portion of the foreign currency borrowings in non-operating units as net investment hedges.
As at 31 December 2008, CHF331m of the Groups borrowings were designated as net investment hedges: the movement in the fair value of these hedges attributable to changes in exchange rates is recognised directly in reserves.
The fair value of these borrowings at 31 December 2008 was $311m.
It is the Groups policyfor operating units not to hold material  .
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways.
Firstly on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, transactional exposures arising where some or all the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale.
The principal transactional exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies  inEurosexceeds theproportionofcosts inEuros.
The impact of currencymovements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows for forecast foreign currency inventory purchases for up to one year.
When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are used to increase the hedges to 100% of the exposure.
The cash flows relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within twelve months of inception and the profits and losses on the hedges are expected to enter into the determination of profit within cost of goods sold within a further twelve month period.
The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros and Sterling.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $652m 2007$480m.
Based on the Groups borrowings as at 31 December 2008, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Groups net borrowings would increase by $78m 2007 $106m.
Excluding borrowings held in the same currency as the relevant reporting entity, if the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, the Groups borrowings would increase by $52m 2007 $72m.
Excluding borrowings designated as net investment hedges, the increase would be $21m 2007 $26m, thisincreasewouldbe fullyoffset .
If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2008 wouldhave been$16mlower 2007$24m whichwouldbe recognised through the hedging reserve.
Similarly, if Euro were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2008 would havebeen$19mhigher 2007$17m.
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar against all other currencies at 31 December would have had the equal butoppositeeffect , onthebasis that allothervariables remainconstant.
Since it is the Groups policy to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, the net impact of transaction related   isnotsignificant.
Financial Instruments and Risk Management continued Interest Rate Exposures The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and currency swaps which are all at floating rates.
The Group uses floating to fixed interest swaps to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in equity, with the fair value of the interest rate swaps recorded in the balance sheet.
The cash flows resulting from interest rate swaps match cash flows on the underlying borrowings so that there is no net cash flow from movements in market interest rates on the hedged items.
The Group had fixed future interest rates on borrowingstotalling$819mat 31December2008 2007$710m foraperiodofoneyear.
Based on the Groups borrowings as at 31 December 2008, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the annual net interest charge would increase by $5m 2007 $6m.
Excluding the impact of the Groups interest rate hedges, the increase in the interest charge would be $13m 2007 $13m.
Similarly if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies, the fair value of the Groups interest rate swaps would increase equity by $7m 2007 $7m.
A decrease in interest rates by 100basis  .
Credit Risk Exposures The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with certain minor exceptions due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum A rating from the major ratings agencies.
The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk as the Group operates  toreduceexposure .
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2008 was $38m 2007 $1m being the gross debit fair value on forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps.
The maximum credit risk exposure on cash and bank at 31 December 2008 was $145m 2007 $170m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a numberofdifferent countries.
Financial Instruments and Risk Management continued Currency and Interest Rate Profile of Interest Bearing Liabilitiesand Assets In 2008, the Group entered into a series of interest rate swaps to fix the monthly interest payable on $819m 2007 $710m of the Groups floating rate borrowings for a period of one year.
The swaps are denominated in US Dollars, Euros and Swiss Francs.

In addition to the above, the Group has liabilities due for acquisition consideration denominated in US Dollars, Australian Dollars, Euro and Yen totalling $47m 2007 $61m on which no interest is payable see Note 23 of the Notes to the Group Accounts.
Floating rates on liabilities are typically based on the one or three-month LIBOR interest rate relevant to the currency concerned.
The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings as at 31 December 2008 was 2% 20074%.
