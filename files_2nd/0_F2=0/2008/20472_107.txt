i The Approved Share Incentive Plan the SIP Eligible employees qualify for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year period.
The current maximum award for each half-year amounts to 600,000 shares or a maximum annual award of 3,000 per employee if smaller.
The awards are made with reference to the Groups performance against prior year profit before tax.
Employees must remain in employment for the holding period three years from the date of award otherwise the shares are forfeited.
The fair value of shares awarded is either the share price at the date of award, or is estimated at the latest share price available when drawing up the financial statements for awards not yet made and later adjusted to reflect the actual share price on the award date.
Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and hence no adjustment has been made to this fair value.
ii The Discretionary Free Share Scheme the DFSS Under the DFSS, details of which are contained in the Remuneration report, individuals receive an award of free shares at no charge.
Staff must remain in employment until the vesting date in order to receive shares.
The maximum number of shares that can vest relating to the 2008 scheme is 1,372,001 2007 scheme: 964,000.
Individual awards are calculated based on the growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS relative to a risk free return RFR, for which LIBOR has been selected as a benchmark.
This performance is measured over the same three-year period.

Awards under the DFSS are not eligible for dividends and hence the fair value of free shares to be awarded under this scheme has been revised downwards to take account of these distributions.
The unadjusted fair value is based on the share price at the date on which awards were made as stated in the Remuneration Report.
