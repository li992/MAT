iii The value of net increase 4 represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service terminated at the year-end.
It is based on the increase in accrued pension 2 with the exception of Mr Gibson whose accrual ended on 5 April 2006. iv The change in transfer value 5 includes the effect of fluctuations in such value due to factors beyond the control of the company and the directors, such as stock market movements.
v Mr Gibson receives a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 40% of his base salary.
vi A large part of the increase in transfer values over the year is due to the assumptions underlying the year end transfer values being different to those at the start of the year.
This is due partly to changing market conditions over the year, in particular falling government bond yields, on which the transfer values are based.
In the case of Messrs Buckles and Gibson, around 70% of the increase in their transfer values is due to changing assumptions.
In Mr Dightons case, the corresponding figure is around 40%.
