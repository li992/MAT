The loans bear interest at a variable margin over LIBOR of between 0.30% and 0.525% dependent on the ratio of EBITDA to Net Debt and the level of utilisation.
Loan notes total 0.5m of which 0.4m relates to the acquisition of Boldon James and 0.1m relates to the acquisition of HVR Consulting Ltd.
The Boldon James notes were repaid in April 08 and the HVR loan notes are repayable on request of the holders, but no later than 31 July 2009 and bear interest at a discount to the Lloyds TSB Base Rate.
H Sensitivity and analysis The Groups sensitivity to changes in market rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2008 is set out in the table below.
The impact of a weakening in sterling on the Groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease or increase of 1% 100 basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 31 March 2008, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 31 March 2008, with all other variables remaining constant.
An increase in interest rates or a strengthening in sterling would have an equal and opposite effect.
Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
