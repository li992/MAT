Any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the Income Statement within financing costs.
 Any change in the fair value of the hedged item, attributable to the hedged risk, is adjusted against the carrying value of the hedged item and recognised immediately in the Income Statement within financing costs.
 Cash flow hedging Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to variability in cash flows that is  attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised directly in equity to the extent that the  hedge is effective.
To the extent the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
 Discontinuance of hedge accounting If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
The cumulative gain or loss previously  recognised in equity remains there until the forecast transaction occurs.
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised.
In other  cases the amount recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.

One-off charges European Supply Chain restructuring  On 27 September 2007, the Group publicly announced its decision to close the Spain manufacturing plant, and transfer production to India and Thailand, and to close the Technical Services Centre in Cambridge, with its activities transferred to the technical centres at Peterlee, Thailand and India.
The Group also committed to restructuring the Footwear Development Group.
Operations in Spain and Cambridge had ceased by 31 March 2008: the key uncertainties in  relation to these sites is the timing and final cost of addressing the surplus freehold and leasehold properties on these sites, for which provisions remain at 31 March 2008 transferred to the surplus property provision, and the potential transfer of plant at the Rubi site to other manufacturing facilities in China, for which Chinese Government approval is required.
The restructuring of the Footwear Development Group has been completed.
 On 28 February 2008, the Group announced its decision to close the Guernsey manufacturing facility, with production to be transferred to the Peterlee facility or to third-party suppliers: production at Guernsey is anticipated to cease during the calendar year 2008.
Again, the key uncertainty relating to this closure is the timing and final cost of disposing of the surplus freehold and leasehold property on the site.
 A total provision of 41.3 million was made with regards to these restructuring projects, relating to redundancies, fixed asset write-offs and other closure and restructuring costs: the remaining provision at the balance sheet date, after transfer of surplus property amounts to the surplus property provision, is 22.4 million.
Cash outflows of 14.4 million have occurred as at 31 March 2008, and of the 22.4 million provision remaining, 14.9 million of cash outflows  are anticipated.
It is expected that the majority of cash outflows will occur in the forthcoming 12 months, although, as noted above, there is some uncertainty regarding the period of time in which the Groups obligations in relation to surplus property can be discharged.
 In addition to the 41.3 million operational restructuring costs, there were one-off financial expenses of 5.2 million as detailed in note 3.        56 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2008      3.

The total charge of 11.8 million 2007: 13.1 million includes a credit of 4.3 million relating to the one-off charges 2007: nil.
Included within the overseas taxation is a benefit of 1.2 million arising from previously unrecognised deferred tax assets 2007: 0.5 million.
 Deferred tax charged to the income statement in the year arises principally in respect of the origination and reversal of temporary differences.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates as the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group and no tax is  expected to be payable on earnings in the forseeable future.
The UK standard rate of corporation tax is 28 per cent from 1 April 2008.
The effect of this is a reduction in the UK deferred tax asset of 0.8 million the total effect on the Group of changes in tax rates is 0.6 million.
 The phased abolition of Industrial Building Allowances in the UK is anticipated to be enacted in the 2008 Finance Act.
The expected effect of this will be to increase the deferred tax liability provided on accelerated capital allowances as at 31 March 2008 by approximately 1 million.

The increase in income tax losses in the year of 3.0 million is explained by a foreign currency retranslation difference  of 4.8 million on losses carried forward at 2007, net of a decrease in losses carried forward of 1.8 million.
It is probable that future taxable profit will not be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom.
Included in the losses are US income tax losses of USD 120 million 2007: USD 103 million which are unlikely to be available for use due to the change of ownership restrictions.
 44.9 million 2007: 43.6 million of the income tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
The remaining losses held in overseas entities may expire over periods of up to 20 years.
Loss earnings per 0.10 ordinary share  Loss earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the loss profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
 The loss profit attributable to ordinary shareholders is as follows: 2008 2007 m m  Loss profit for the year: 2.9 32.5 For basic loss earnings per share 2.9 32.5  The profit before one-off charges for adjusted EPS disclosed in the Chairmans statement and the Performance review of the annual report, is as follows: 2008 2007 m m  Loss profit for the year as reported 2.9 32.5 Add back net impact of one-off charges 42.2  Profit before one-off charges for adjusted EPS 39.3 32.5 The calculation of diluted earnings per share uses basic earnings as defined above, and the basic weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during  the period, adjusted as follows: 2008 2007 Weighted average number of shares millions :  Number of ordinary shares at start of year 190.2 189.9 Effect of shares issued in the year share options exercised 0.4 0.3 For basic and adjusted earnings per share 190.6 190.2  Dilutive effect of share options 1.8 0.7 For diluted earnings per share 192.4 190.9  The dilutive effect of share options is only considered when a loss is made to the extent that the dilutive effect increases the loss per share.
The diluted loss per share for the year ended 31 March 2008 is therefore equal to the basic loss per share.

The impairment charge in the prior year related to the impairment of goodwill relating to the Remegel locally owned brand, following a review of the recoverable amount, based on discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continued use of the brand.
The key assumptions used in the review were that future revenue would decline by  8.8 per cent per annum, and operating margins by 2 per cent per annum.
Results were projected forwards for 12 years and discounted to present value using risk adjusted discount factor of 6.8 per cent.
For the purposes of impairment testing of goodwill, the Group is regarded as several cash-generating units, one for each component of goodwill recognised  at the balance sheet date, and one for all other consumer products.
The cash-generating units recoverable amounts are based on value in use using projections of the Groups performance over 1015 years, periods reflecting the Directors best estimates of the cash flows.
Risk adjusted discount factors of 6.8 per cent7.8 per cent have been applied to the projections.
 Material assets Scholl brand  The Scholl brand, with a carrying value of 60.8 million at 31 March 2008, is not amortised.
The brand has been tested for impairment using the method described below.
No charge for impairment was required in the year.
For the purposes of impairment testing of the Scholl brand, the Group is regarded as two cash-generating units, that part relating to Scholl branded products  and that relating to all other consumer products.
The Scholl brands recoverable amount was determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the brand using the following key assumptions:  cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results revenue growth was anticipated at 2 per cent per annum and operating results held at a constant percentage of revenue for a further period of nine years.
This is in line with experience in prior years  operating results were then held at the year ten figures into perpetuity reflecting the Directors assertion that the brand has an indefinite useful economic t life based upon its proven value over long periods and its position in the market which is considered sustainable for the foreseeable future a risk adjusted discount factor of 6.8 per cent was applied to the projections t For the Scholl brand to be be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 22 per cent before the brands value in use calculation showed any impairment.
Removing the revenue growth from the expected cash flows would decrease the valuation by 25 million, however the brand would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would  reduce the valuation by 34 million, however the brand would still show no impairment.
   64 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2008      Goodwill arising on acquisition of Qingdao London Durex Company Limited China Goodwill Goodwill of 17.2 million arose on the acquisition of the remaining 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Qingdao London Durex Company Limited in  January 2007 as detailed in note 9.
For the purposes of impairment testing of the China Goodwill, Qingdao London Durex Company Limited was identified as a single cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount was determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the goodwill using the following  key assumptions: cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results  revenue growth was anticipated at 3 per cent per annum and operating results held at a constant percentage of revenue for a further period of nine years operating results were then held at the year ten figures into perpetuity reflecting the expected maintenance of the position in the market a risk adjusted discount factor of 7.8 per cent was applied to the projections  For the China Goodwill to be be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 60 per cent before the value in use calculation showed any impairment.
Removing the revenue growth from the expected cash flows would decrease the valuation by 26 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would reduce the  valuation by 1.7 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
Vasyli goodwill  An impairment review has been performed at 31 March 2008 in relation to the goodwill of 12.8 million arising on the acquisition of the Vasyli business in November 2007 see below.
The Vasyli business, encompassing consumer sales of the Orthaheel, Orthastyle, Vasyli and VAS brands across the Group was identified as a single cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount was determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the goodwill using the following key assumptions:  cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results revenue growth was anticipated at 3 per cent per annum for the first 10 years, nil thereafter, and operating results held at a constant percentage of revenue  operating results were then held at the year 10 figures for a further 10 years reflecting the current expected useful life of the goodwill and related brands a risk adjusted discount factor of 7.8 per cent was applied to the projections For the Vasyli goodwill to be be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 27 per cent  before the value in use calculation showed any impairment.
Removing the revenue growth from the expected cash flows would decrease the valuation by 7.4 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
A decrease in the operating margin percentage by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by 0.8 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.
 The remaining goodwill is made up of a number of balances, none of which are significant, with a total net book value of 12.5 million.
Impairment reviews have been performed in respect of all balances held.
 Other intangible assets comprise a number of non-material cash-generating units.
Business combination  On 7 November 2007, the Group acquired the business and certain business assets of Vasyli Australia Pty Ltd, Vasyli NZ Limited, and Vasyli UK Limited together Vasyli, in Europe and Asia, the main assets being the Orthaheel, Orthastyle, Vasyli and VAS brands.
The initial cash consideration was AUS$32.9 million: the total consideration could increase to AUS$74.9 million if certain sales growth targets are attained, with the balance payable in June 2010.
Further detail of the contingent consideration recognised is provided in note 16.
This transaction has been accounted for by the purchase  method of accounting.

Intangible assets continued Recognition of intangible assets  Intangible assets were not separately identified or recorded in the underlying records of the acquired business.
On acquisition, the Group identified several intangible assets, including the brand names acquired and their related Intellectual Property rights, and customer relationships.
Two patents were also acquired as part of the business assets, although they relate to only two countries, have relatively short expiry periods and relate to relatively old technology: their fair  value is therefore calculated as nil.
The brand and intellectual property rights are being amortised over 20 years and the customer relationships over a period of between three and five years.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Vasyli business is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the distribution of the Vasyli products in new  markets using the Groups existing distribution channels, for example, across the rest of Europe and Asia, and the expected future operating synergies arising from the integration of the Vasyli business with that of Scholl footcare.
The goodwill will be subject to annual impairment reviews.
The Vasyli businesses contributed 1.8 million revenue and 0.6 million to the Groups profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and the  balance sheet date.
It is not practicable to disclose what the contribution to Group revenue and profits would have been had the acquisition been completed on 1 April 2007, as the vendors did not prepare consolidated financial information for the aspects of the business acquired by the Group.

There are no investments in associates at 31 March 2008.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities at the acquisition date: Recognised  Pre acquisition Fair value value on carrying amounts adjustments acquisition m m m  Property, plant and equipment 1.1 1.1 Inventories 0.9 0.9 Cash and cash equivalents 5.6 5.6  Trade and other payables 3.5 3.5 Current tax payable Net identifiable assets and liabilities 4.1 4.1  Less amounts recognised as share of asssociate prior to acquisition 2.1 Goodwill on acquisition note 8 17.2 Consideration paid, satisfied in cash 19.2  Less cash acquired 5.6 Net cash outflow 13.6 Includes legal fees of 0.1 million  The excess of fair value of consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired was attributed wholly to goodwill as the Group supplies the brand and know-how to the business and existing customer relationships were terminated as part of the sale and purchase agreement.
   66 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2008      The goodwill acquired represents the benefits of securing control of the financial and operating policies of the business.
This is expected to lead to increased profits as a result of the establishment of new distributor relationships at higher margins to those achieved previously and the opportunity to establish the  Scholl brand alongside Durex in this key market.
In time the acquisition will also provide synergies to the Groups manufacturing cost base by providing additional condom manufacturing capacity to support the Group supply chain.
The Group has not recognised as part of the acquisition an asset in relation to the Durex brand as the Group already owned the brand worldwide prior to the acquisition.

t Loan notes, interest rate and currency swaps held as a fair value hedge The following table shows the carrying values of loan notes, interest rate and currency swaps forming part of a fair value hedge relationship under IFRS.
 2008 2007 m m  Loan notes: US$ 8.02 per cent guaranteed 8.1 Currency swap: US$ 8.02 per cent loan notes to Euro 6.09 per cent fixed rate borrowing 1.8 Interest rate swap: Euro 6.09 per cent fixed rate to Euro variable rate borrowing 0.2  9.7    70 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2008      The loan notes, interest rate and currency swaps held as a fair value hedge are carried at fair value under IFRS.
The hedge was in place to reduce exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.
 The notional amount of the US$ 8.02 per cent guaranteed loan notes at 31 March 2007 was US$15.2 million.
The US$ 8.02 per cent loan notes were issued in November 1999, were repayable in six further equal instalments maturing in November 2009, and were not secured on any assets of the Group.
The loan notes were repaid early in October 2007, and the related swaps cancelled.
Finance charges of 5.2 million relating to the change in the carrying amount of all loan  notes and related derivative balances on notification of the early repayment of the loan notes have been recognised in the year.
The notional amount and payment terms of loan notes and swaps were equal.
The hedge effectiveness, tested semi-annually, was effective during the  period up until repayment in providing a hedge against fair value adjustments relating to interest rate changes.
The fair value charge in the year arising from movements in interest rates was nil 2007: 1.8 million credit.

The currency swap was held at fair value at 31 March 2007.  The notional amount of the Sterling 7.87 per cent loan notes at 31 March 2007 was 5.9 million: the notional amount of the US$ 8.19 per cent loan notes at 31 March 2007 was US$104.2 million.
The Sterling loan notes were issued in November 1999, and were repayable in full, in November 2014.
The US$ loan notes  were issued in November 1999, and were repayable in full, in November 2009.
The loan notes were not secured on any assets of the Group.
As noted above, all loan notes were repaid in October 2007.
The fair value of the 7.87 per cent guaranteed loan notes, held at amortised cost, at 31 March 2007 was 6.2 million.
The fair value of the 8.19 per cent loan  notes also held at cost at 31 March 2007 was 56.1 million.
The loans and swaps do not constitute a fair value hedge, consequently the  Group was exposed to fair value changes from interest rate movements in the US$ and Sterling.
These fair value changes resulted in a credit of 1.8 million in the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2007.
The Groups exposure to fair value changes is considered further in note 23.
As noted above, the loan notes and related swaps were cancelled in October 2007.

The interest rate swaps are held at fair value.
Changes in fair value totalling 0.7 million have been charged directly to equity in relation to fair value movements in the interest rate swaps during the year ended 31 March 2008.  Bank loans held as a net investment hedge The Japanese Yen drawdown on the Group facility of 4.6 million 2007: 3.9 million is designated as a net investment hedge of the Groups investment in subsidiaries denominated in Japanese Yen.
 Obligations under finance leases Finance lease liabilities are secured on the assets to which they relate.
The average lease term outstanding is one year.
For the year ended 31 March 2008, the  average effective borrowing rate was 7.12 per cent 2007: 7.70 per cent.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
The lease obligations are denominated in Thai Baht and Sterling, and the fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying value.

 Overseas termination benefits Included with overseas termination benefits is an amount of 3.0 million 2007: 2.8 million for termination benefits payable to employees in a number of overseas subsidiaries.
Benefits accrue with service and are payable to employees upon departure from the Group regardless of the reason for such  departure.
Benefits may be calculated with reference to an average salary over the service life of the employee or the final salary of the employee.
Differences arising due to changes in assumptions in calculating the liability for employees are taken through reserves and are included above within exchange and other movements.
The main assumptions underlying the calculation on a weighted average basis across the various schemes are salary  increases of 2.0 per cent, an inflation rate of 2.0 per cent and a discount rate of 3.0 per cent.
The calculation of the provision is determined by contractual obligation and therefore can be estimated reliably.
No terminations are expected in the forthcoming year.
Provision is also made for termination payments which may be required for sales agents.
At the year end an amount of 1.0 million was provided  2007: 1.1 million.
The amount provided is based upon payments which would be required under collective agreements to sales agents upon termination of their contracts by the Group.
Increase and decreases in the provision, aside from utilisation, are reflected within the income statement.
 Disposals Following the Groups disposal of the medical business, in 2004 and 2005, a number of disposal provisions were created for the ongoing commitments of the Group in respect of the disposals.
The Group has utilised the majority of these provisions during the current year, with the residual balance transferred  into environmental provisions included within the other category.
Manufacturing restructuring  During 2005 the Group announced its decision to close the Derby manufacturing plant and transfer production to India.
This process has been completed during the current financial year.
3.4 million, which relates to a provision for a non-cancellable lease for the Derby site, was reclassified into surplus property within other during the prior year.
 Group and commercial restructuring The Group has completed its previous rationalisation and restructuring of commercial operations during the current financial year.
      73   t Notes to the consolidated financial statements t continued t 16.
Provisions for liabilities continued European Supply Chain restructuring  During the current financial year, as part of the European Supply Chain restructuring detailed in note 2, provisions of 41.3 million were made in relation to the closure of the manufacturing facilities at Rubi Spain and Guernsey, the closure of the Technical Services Centre in Cambridge, and the restructuring of the Footwear Development Group.
Following the announcement of phase 1 of this restructuring programme in September 2007, a provision of 5.2 million was  recorded in relation to the early repayment of loan notes and settlement of related derivatives, giving a total provision created in the year of 46.5 million.
Surplus property provisions in relation to the closure of these sites of 2.6 million have been transferred to the surplus property provision within the other provision.
It is anticipated that all of the remaining European Supply Chain restructuring provision will be utilised within the financial year 2008 09.
The key  uncertainties regarding the provision are in relation to the potential transfer of plant at the Rubi site to other manufacturing facilities in China, for which Chinese Government approval is required.
 Other Other provisions relate to a number of pre-merger environmental provisions of 1.2 million and surplus property provisions of 7.2 million.
Environmental provisions are provided for to the extent that a present obligation exists, it is probable such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated  reliably.
No provision is made for possible additional costs that are not currently probable.
The surplus property provision relates to Group commitments under non-cancellable leases which, following historical restructuring exercises, are no longer  used by the Group.
The obligation, net of expected rental income, has been provided for.
t Surplus property and environmental costs of 4.8 million have been included as non-current.
It is expected that all other provisions will be utilised during the next financial year.
 Contingent consideration Contingent consideration of 1.5 million releates to the acquisition of the Vasyli business as detailed in note 8, which is payable in June 2010.
The  consideration is contingent upon the level of Orthaheel-branded sales achieved across the Group in the year ended 31 March 2010, and is capped at 19.4 million.
The amount recognised within provisions at 31 March 2008 is the amount which is considered probable to be paid, based on detailed budgets for 2008 09 and forecast growth for 2009 10.
There are inherent uncertainties in deriving sales forecasts, as the Group has limited data and experience  on which to estimate growth in existing Orthaheel markets, and Orthaheel products are to be launched in new markets in 2008 09.
The level of contingent t consideration will be reassessed at each reporting date to reflect revisions to forecasts or differences betweeen budget and actual sales performance.
Post-retirement benefits The Group continues to operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans in the UK and overseas.
All UK defined benefit schemes are  closed to new entrants.
UK Pensions  a Defined contribution schemes Since 1995, the Group has operated a contracted-in defined contribution scheme which is open to UK employees.
It also operates defined contribution executive pension plans for senior executives.
Employer contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
 The total pension cost for the Group in respect of UK defined contribution schemes was 1.3 million 2007: 1.4 million.
b Defined benefit schemes  The Group continues to operate a number of defined benefit schemes following the mergers of Seton Healthcare Group plc and Scholl PLC to form Seton Scholl in 1998, and the subsequent merger of Seton Scholl and London International Group Limited LIG in 1999.
All UK schemes have been closed to new entrants.
The finances of all schemes are assessed regularly by independent actuaries and all assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered  funds.
The schemes have provided benefits for employees as outlined below: i Seton Prior to 1995, the Group operated a defined benefit scheme for employees.
Accrual of further service-related benefits under this scheme ceased in  August 1995, but existing benefits at that date are being maintained.
The latest valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2006.
The Group expects to make contributions of 0.5 million into the scheme during the next financial year.

The Group expects to make contributions of 0.6 million into the scheme during the next financial year.
iii LIG  Accrual of further service-related benefits under this defined benefit scheme ceased in January 2001, but benefits accrued to 31 January 2001 continue to be provided from the scheme.
The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2006.
The Group expects to make contributions of 8.2 million into the scheme during the next financial year.
 Overseas pensions and similar obligations The Group has a number of pension schemes in different countries, both defined benefit and defined contribution.
Defined benefit schemes are set up  under separate trust funds and liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The total pension cost for the Group in respect of overseas defined contribution schemes was 2.2 million 2007: 1.9 million.
Details of the material overseas defined benefit schemes are given below.
The most recent valuation for each scheme, as at the dates disclosed above, were updated for IAS 19 purposes to 31 March 2008  by independent qualified actuaries.
The principal assumptions used by the actuaries in determining the present value of the liabilities were: 2008 Seton Scholl LIG Overseas  Rate of increase in salaries 4.50% 4.50% 4.50% 3.60% Pensions increases per annum 3.40% 2.00%  Pensions accrued to 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.00% Open section 2.60% Pensions accrued from 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.70%  Open section 3.40% Pre April 1997 2.40% Post April 1997 3.40%  Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 6.50% 6.50% 6.50% 6.00% Inflation assumption 3.50% 3.50% 3.50% 2.90%  2007 Seton Scholl LIG Overseas Rate of increase in salaries 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% 4.00%  Pensions increases per annum 3.00% 3.00% Pensions accrued to 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.00% Open section 2.25%  Pensions accrued from 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.25% Open section 3.00% Pre April 1997 2.10%  Post April 1997 3.00% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.40% 5.40% 5.40% 4.75% Inflation assumption 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 3.00%  For the UK schemes, the mortality assumption was updated in 2007 to reflect the experience analysis conducted as part of the most recent UK scheme valuations as at 5 April 2006.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality.
The assumed life expectancy for  a 65-year-old male retiring in the current period is 20.1 years 2007: 20.0 years and for a male retiring in 20 years at age 65 life expectancy is 21.2 years 2007: 21.1 years.
The rate of return on government and corporate bonds is the yield rate at each year end date for long-dated bonds.
The rate for cash is the same as that for government bonds.
The equity rate of return is derived by adding a risk adjustment factor to the government bond rate.
 The rate for insurance contracts reflects the yield rate at the balance sheet date.

Employees may choose to withdraw from the scheme, at which point they  will receive their cash savings plus interest.
Acquisition price  The price per ordinary share payable upon the exercise of an option was 80 per cent of the average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share on the London Stock Exchange on the dealing date prior to the date on which invitations to apply for options were issued.
 Exercise of options t An option will normally be exercisable for six months commencing on the third or fifth anniversary of the start of the related savings contract.
Options may be satisfied by the issue of new shares or through the Seton Healthcare Group Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust either by newly issued shares or market purchases by the Trust.
Options will normally lapse upon cessation of employment.

 Deferred Share Bonus Plan This plan was in operation for the 2005 06 financial year only, and was intended to provide a focused incentive upon achievement of short-term financial objectives.
Under the scheme, executives were awarded a bonus upon achievement of EPS targets, capped at 100 per cent of salary for the Chief Executive and 75 per cent of salary for Executive Directors.
The bonus earned was converted into an equivalent notional number of shares at a price of 321.75 pence  and deferred until 30 March 2007.
Payment was subject to the employee remaining in service at that point in time.
The amount paid, in cash, in April 2007 was the value of the notional number of shares awarded multiplied by the average share price during March 2007.  Performance Share Plan This plan, approved at the Companys AGM in July 2005, is intended to be the Companys only active long-term incentive plan.
Eligibility is restricted to the Chief Executive and senior executives currently the top 35 employees.
Annual grants do not exceed 100 per cent of base salary.
Shares are awarded and  will vest after three years subject to performance conditions being met.
Executive share option plans and share savings plans  The executive share option plans include executive options that have a TSR performance condition attached.
These options have been valued using the Monte-Carlo simulation model.
All other options have been valued using the Black Scholes formula.
There have been no share options granted in the current or preceeding financial year.
The fair value of the services received for share options granted in earlier years was calculated at the date of grant and disclosure  of the assumptions applied in valuing those options was provided in the annual report in the applicable year.

    82 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2008      Equity holders of the parent The Group previously had an investment in own shares which represented shares acquired by the Seton Healthcare Group Qualifying Employee Share  Ownership Trust QUEST and Seton Healthcare Group Employee Ownership Plan ESOP.
The shares were purchased on the open market and were held for employees participating in various share schemes.
The shares held at the start of the prior year were issued to employees for cash consideration of 0.2 million following option exercises under the sharesave and executive option schemes.
During the year ended 31 March 2007 further shares were issued into the  trusts and issued to employees to satisfy option exercises under the sharesave and executive option schemes.
This resulted in a reduction in retained earnings of 0.3 million at 31 March 2007.

Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit: liquidity: interest rate: and currency.
Further information on the Groups exposure to these risks is presented below, with an explanation of the Groups policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks.
 The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and review of the Groups risk management policies and procedures: these guidelines are designed to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, including setting and monitoring compliance with appropriate limits and controls.
The policies  are reviewed regularly and amended where appropriate to reflect changes in the Groups operations, risk exposure and market conditions.
The Board is assisted by the Groups Business Assurance function, which undertakes regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
 The Groups Treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates acess to domestic and international financial markets and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group.
 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the the Groups trade receivables and investment securities.
 Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer: the default risk of the industry and country in which  customers operate has less of an influence on credit risk.
Geographically, approximately 7580 per cent of the Groups debtors are in Europe.
t Group exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy, which is reviewed annually, for limiting credit exposure to counterparties, reviewing credit ratings, and limiting individual aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of non-performance  by a financial counterparty to be unlikely.
Customer credit risk is monitored at a subsidiary level by divisional management, and is reviewed at Group level by country.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group does not require  collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
     84 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2008      The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component  established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payments statistics for similar financial assets.
 Investment securities Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments.
Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded derivatives.
The Group deposits central funds, when available, with highly rated banks, in line with Group policy.
The central funds on deposit at the balance sheet  date were 15 million 2007: 9.5 million.
Guarantees The Groups policy is to provide financial guarantees only to wholly-owned subsidiaries.
At 31 March 2008, no guarantees were outstanding 2007: none.
 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure,  as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
 The Group manages liquidity risks by ensuring that any anticipated funding requirements, based on detailed cash flow forecasts at subsidiary and Group level, will be met by access to different sources of funding.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of 3060 days, including the servicing of financial obligations.
In addition, the Group maintains the credit facilities detailed in note 15.  Committed undrawn facilities available to the Group in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2008 2007 m m  Expiring in one year or less 70.0 Expiring in more than one year and less than two years Expiring in more than two years 97.0 146.1  Total 97.0 216.1  Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices, would affect the Groups income, the value of its holdings of financial instruments, or its obligations in respect of retirement benefits.
 Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Groups entities.
Where practicable, the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge major transactional exposures on working capital balances.
 At the start of each financial year, the Group hedges approximately 50 to 70 per cent of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecast sales and purchases over the forthcoming financial year.
 Interest on borrowings is primarily denominated in Sterling, such that no related foreign currency derivatives are required.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.
 The Groups investment in its Japanese subsidiary is hedged by a Japanese Yen-denominated secured bank loan which mitiages the currency risk arising from the subsidiarys net assets.
 Interest rate risk The Groups fixed rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in their fair value due to changes in interest rates.
 The Groups variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates: the Group has reduced its exposure to this by entering into interest rate swaps.
     85   t Notes to the consolidated financial statements t continued t 22.
Financial risk management continued Other market price risk  The Group does not speculate in equity securities, nor does the Group enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Groups expected usage requirements.
The Group holds a strategic investment of 1 million in the equity securities of an unlisted company as detailed in note 9, this is not deemed to expose the Group to market price risk, although the investment is subject to annual impairment reviews.
 Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:  Carrying amount Carrying amount 2008 2007 m m  Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and derivative financial assets 169.0 143.2 Available for sale financial assets 1.0 Cash and cash equivalents 44.6 40.3  Interest rate swaps used for hedging 0.1 Other forward exchange contracts 0.4 0.3  The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount Carrying amount 2008 2007 m m  United Kingdon 23.9 22.7 Europe 104.9 89.3  Asia Pacific 4.0 3.9 t United States 22.1 18.0 154.9 133.9  The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Allowance Allowance Gross for impairment Gross for impairment  2008 2008 2007 2007 m m m m Trade receivables due within terms 155.2 126.8  Past due by less than 30 days 7.7 4.8 Past due 31120 days 8.4 8.7 Past due 120365 days 3.8 2.0 3.3 0.6  More than one year 3.8 3.8 3.3 3.3 178.9 5.8 146.9 3.9 Provision for rebates 18.2 9.1  Gross trade receivables note 11 160.7 137.8 Allowance for impairment 5.8 3.9 Net credit exposure 154.9 133.9  There are no customers representing more than 2 per cent of the total balance of trade receivables.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
 The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for impairment.
Movement on the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables is disclosed in note 11.
Based on previous experience, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due.
 All receivables classified as non-current are within the respective payment contractual terms.
     86 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2008      Liquidity risk The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting arrangements: 0 2008  Carrying Contractual 6 months More than amount cash flows or less 612 months 12 years 25 years 5 years Non-derivative financial liabilities  Secured bank loans 123.0 124.5 113.9 10.6 Finance lease liabilities 0.1 0.1 0.1 Unsecured bank facility 8.8 8.9 8.9  Trade and other payables 138.8 138.8 138.0 0.8 Bank overdrafts 10.9 10.9 10.9  Derivative financial liabilities Interest rate swaps used for hedging 0.8 0.8 0.8  2007 Carrying Contractual 6 months More than amount cash flows or less 612 months 12 years 25 years 5 years Non-derivative financial liabilities  Secured bank loans 33.9 34.3 34.3 Loan notes 67.2 85.8 2.7 5.8 8.1 61.9 7.3 Finance lease liabilities 0.3 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.1  Unsecured bank facility 3.6 3.6 3.4 0.2 Trade and other payables 118.2 118.2 118.2 Bank overdrafts 13.2 13.2 12.4 0.8  Derivative financial liabilities Interest rate swaps used for hedging 10.8 10.8 10.8  Forward exchange conracts used for hedging 0.3 0.3 0.3 Derivative financial liabilities are accounted for at fair value and it is not deemed appropriate to allocate the cash flows across the maturity categories.
 The loan notes at 31 March 2007 were repaid in full in October 2007 following the announcement of the European Supply Chain restructuring programme: the related interest rate swaps used for hedging were also settled at that time.
The early repayment of the loan notes and related swaps led to a one-off finance charge of 5.2 million as disclosed in note 3.  The interest rate swaps used for hedging at 31 March 2008 are designated in a cash flow hedge relationship against 60 million of the secured bank loans, and therefore the related cash flows will not impact upon profit or loss until the hedge relationship ceases.
 Currency risk Exposure to currency risk The Groups main exposure to foreign currency risk was in respect of the Euro, based on notional amounts: 2008 2007  Exposure to Exposure to Euro risk Euro risk m m  Trade receivables 95.3 77.8 Trade payables 31.7 22.1 Other payables 23.8 19.3  Gross balance sheet exposure 39.8 36.4       87   t Notes to the consolidated financial statements t continued t 22.
Financial risk management continued Net exposure to currency risk with regards to other foreign currencies was not significant at 31 March 2008 or 31 March 2007.  The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate for the year Balance sheet date 2008 2007 2008 2007  Euro 1.4187 1.4756 1.2543 1.4735 Sensitivity analysis  A 10 per cent strengthening of Sterling against the Euro at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007 would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
2008 2007 Profit Profit  Equity or loss Equity or loss Euro 1.6 1.1 1.5 3.5  A 10 per cent weakening of Sterling against the Euro at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007 would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
 Interest rate risk At the reporting date, the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: 2008 2007  m m Fixed rate instruments Financial assets 2.1 2.8  Financial liabilities 9.2 68.6 Variable rate instruments  Financial assets 42.5 37.5 Financial liabilities 133.6 60.4  Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments At 31 March 2008, the Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group has not designated interest rate swaps under a fair value hedge accounting model.
Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.
 Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments Due to the short maturity dates of the drawdowns on the Group facility at 31 March 2008 average maturity 51 days and 31 March 2007 average maturity  83 days, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates at either reporting date would have negligible impact on the carrying value of variable rate financial instruments, and similarly upon profit or loss.
The interest rate swap at 31 March 2008 is included as part of a cash flow hedge relationship, therefore any change in interest rates at the reporting date would have no impact upon profit or loss for the year, only upon the amount recognised in equity within the cash flow  hedge reserve.
There were no variable rate interest rate swaps at 31 March 2007.         88 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2008      Fair values Fair values versus carrying amounts  The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet, are as follows: 2008 2007 m m m m Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value  Available for sale financial assets 1.0 1.0 Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments and derivative financial assets 169.0 169.0 143.2 143.2  Cash and cash equivalents 44.6 44.6 40.3 40.3 Interest rate swaps used for hedging liabilities net 0.7 0.7 10.8 10.8 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3  Secured bank loans 123.0 123.0 33.9 33.9 Finance lease liabilities 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 Unsecured bank facilities 8.8 8.8 3.6 3.6  Trade and other payables 138.8 138.8 118.2 118.2 Bank overdrafts 10.9 10.9 13.2 13.2 67.3 67.3 3.2 3.2  Unrecognised gain loss Basis for determining fair values  The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial insrtuments reflected in the table above.
Available for sale financial assets  The available for sale financial assets at 31 March 2008 is an unquoted entity, therefore fair value of the shareholding cannot be readily ascertained: the investment is therefore held at initial cost which is deemed to be comparable to fair value, although the investment is subject to annual impairment review.
 Derivatives The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for ther residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free  interest rate based on government bonds.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes.
Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the reporting date.
 Non-derivative financial liabilities Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
 In respect of finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
Trade and other receivables  The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
        89   t Notes to the consolidated financial statements t continued t 22.
Financial risk management continued Interest rates used for determining fair value  The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on the government yield curve at the reporting date plus an adequate constant credit spread, and were as follows: 2008 2007  Derivatives N a 7.08% Loans and borrowing N a 7.58%  23.

Cash and cash equivalents at fixed interest rates comprise short-term bank deposits.
These are placed on terms not exceeding three months.
The deposits accrue effective rates of interest of between 2.0 per cent and 3.6 per cent.
 Financial liabilities The Groups fixed rate financial derivatives and fixed rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in their fair value due to changes in interest rates.
The Groups variable rate financial derivatives and variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates.
 Hedging Interest rate and currency swaps, denominated in US Dollars, Euros and Sterling, were in place at 31 March 2007 to hedge the Groups exposure to risks in  accordance with its interest rate policy.
These swaps were matched in maturity to the underlying debt.
At 31 March 2008, the Group had interest rate and currency swaps with a notional amount of 133.0 million 2007: 11.9 million.
Interest rate swaps including those in effective fair value hedging relationships are measured at fair value under IAS 39.  The fair value of interest and currency swaps recognised as hedges at 31 March 2008 is a net liability of 0.7 million comprising assets of 0.1 million and liabilities of 0.8 million 2007: net liabilty of 1.6 million comprising assets of 17.8 million and liabilities of 19.4 million.
 Up to the repayment of the loan notes and settlement of related swaps in November 2007, interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges were fair valued through the income statement as part of net finance costs.
Underlying loans that form part of fair value hedge relationships were adjusted for fair value attributable to hedged risk through the income statement to offset any mark-to-market arising on the interest rate swaps.
Hedge documentation was prepared for all fair value hedges at inception and effectiveness testing was carried out semi-annually.
All designated hedges remained effective throughout  the current financial year to the point of settlement.
The maturity dates of all financial liabilities, together with details of their fair values and carrying values are disclosed in note 15.        90 Financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2008      Effects of interest rate and currency swaps The following reflects the effects of financial derivatives on the Groups borrowings: At 31 March 2008 At 31 March 2007  Before After Before After financial financial financial financial derivatives derivatives derivatives derivatives m m m m  Sterling 110.1 110.1 42.1 106.9 US dollar 60.9 2.5 Euro 28.0 28.0 14.3 23.9  Japanese Yen 4.6 4.6 0.5 0.5 Other currencies 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 142.8 142.8 118.0 129.0  Floating rate borrowings 133.6 133.6 50.7 60.4 Fixed rate borrowings 9.2 9.2 67.3 68.6  142.8 142.8 118.0 129.0 The analysis above does not include the marking-to-market liabilities arising on forward contract derivatives.
