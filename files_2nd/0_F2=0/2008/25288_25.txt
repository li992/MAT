The address of the registered office is on page 96.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors Report on page 46.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: Accounting periods commencing after International Financial Reporting Standards IAS IFRS IFRS 8 Operating segments 1 January 2009 IAS 23 revised March 2007 Borrowing costs 1 January 2009 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008 The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for additional segment disclosures when IFRS 8 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009.
2 Significant accounting policies a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis as modified to include the fair valuation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies are set out below: b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its principal subsidiaries made up to 31 March.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
c Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are recorded in the Company balance sheet at cost less provision for impairments.
d Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but not control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
A presumption of significant influence is made when the Group holds 20 per cent or more of the voting rights of an investee.
IAS 28 Investment in Associates, excludes from its scope certain investments of a greater than 20 per cent holding, held by Venture Capital organisations.
The Group therefore designates such investments, upon initial recognition, as fair value through the profit and loss and measure them at fair value.
e Interest income and expense Interest income and expense on financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost are measured using the effective interest rate method, which allocates the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument.
The expected life of an instrument is estimated by the relevant Investment Executive using knowledge gained from the close monitoring of the investment and their presence on the Board.
72 Intermediate Capital Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial Accounts 2 Significant accounting policies continued f Fee income and expense Fees and commissions are generally recognised on an accruals basis when the service has been provided and include fund management fees and arrangement fees.
Fees integral to the loan yield, including underwriting and agency fees, are included within interest income as part of the effective interest rate calculation.
Fees payable on the arrangement of balance sheet funding are included within interest expense as part of the effective interest rate calculation.
Other fees are generally expensed as incurred.
g Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised in the income statement when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
h Share based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share based payment.
The Group issues equity settled share options to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant using a Black Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
i Pension costs Pension liabilities are provided for by payments to insurance companies or to individuals for employees private pension plans.
The amount charged to the income statement represents a percentage of the current payroll cost paid to defined contribution schemes.
j Value added tax Irrecoverable VAT is written off on items of expenditure relating to the income statement.
VAT on tangible fixed assets is capitalised and written off over a similar period to the asset to which it relates.
k Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling which is the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
The assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated using the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
The income and expense items are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transactions.
Foreign currency monetary transactions are translated into pounds sterling using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences on the translation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement for the year.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts.
The treasury policies of the Group are described in more detail in note 28. l Taxation Provision is made for taxation at the currently enacted rates on taxable profits, arising in income or in equity, taking into account relief for overseas taxation where appropriate.
Deferred taxation is accounted for in full for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability for accounting purposes and its carrying amount for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered.
m Property, plant and equipment and depreciation Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Furniture and equipment 20 per cent to 33 per cent per annum Leasehold improvements 20 per cent per annum Intermediate Capital Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 73 Financial Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued for the Year Ended 31 March 2008 2 Significant accounting policies continued n Financial assets Financial assets are classified into the following categories, as determined at initial recognition: i Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Derivatives, which includes warrants and other derivatives held for risk management purposes, and investments where the Group holds more than 20% of the voting rights of an investee, are categorised as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
Changes in fair value are immediately recognised in the income statement.
ii Loans and receivables Loans and receivables, held at amortised cost, are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They include loans made as part of the Groups operating activities as well as trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents.
iii Available for sale Available for sale assets are financial assets not classified in i or ii above and include listed bonds and listed and unlisted shares, see note 2 p below.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Available for sale assets are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs.
They are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included as a separate component of equity until the sale or impairment, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences on monetary items are recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs and subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, see note 2 e above.
o Impairment of financial assets A financial asset is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of a fall in value of that asset as a result of events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has occurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets effective interest rate.
If there is objective evidence of impairment for financial assets classified as available for sale, the loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
p Shares and warrants Shares and warrants are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and held at this value until it is appropriate to measure fair value on a different basis, applying the valuation policies of ICG.
q Financial liabilities All financial liabilities, except for derivatives, are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative liabilities are categorised as at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedges, see note 2 r below.
74 Intermediate Capital Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial Accounts 2 Significant accounting policies continued r Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are not considered to be closely related to the host contract, are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value using an independent third party valuation.
Changes in fair values of derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting per IAS 32 Financial Instruments Presentation.
s Significant estimates uncertainties The significant accounting estimates in these financial statements are considered to relate to the valuations of impaired assets, equity investments, warrants, share based payment and the effective interest rate calculations.
The methodology for valuing impaired assets is as detailed in note 16 on page 82, for valuing warrants and equity is detailed in note 16 on page 81, for valuing share based payment is as detailed in note 24 on page 87 and for deciding upon the maturity date for the effective interest rate on loans and investments in note 2 e on page 72.
3 Profit of parent company As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the income statement of the parent company is not presented as part of these financial statements.

As these instruments are all held in private companies with no ready market, the events to crystallise such a valuation include the sale of shares to a third party by a substantial shareholder or the approach of an exit to the transaction, either by way of a float or a sale.
Therefore, the fair valuing of such unquoted shares has been restricted to those instruments whose value may be reliably measured for example by one of the above events.
These instruments are otherwise held at cost.

These estimates take into account the level and quality of the investees earnings, the amount and sources of cash flows, the industry in which the investee operates and the likelihood of cash recovery.
Estimating the quantum and timing of these future proceeds involves significant judgement.
The actual amount of future cash flows and the date that they are received may differ from these estimates and consequently actual losses incurred may differ from those recognised in the financial statements.

24 Share based payments Equity settled share option schemes Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme The Company has a number of share option schemes for certain employees of the Group.
The terms of the Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and the Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme are shown on page 59.
In February 2008 ICG completed a two for nine rights issue at 11.5p per share.
In accordance with the terms of the ICG PLC 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and the ICG PLC 2001 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme all outstanding option exercise prices were adjusted by a factor of 0.94797 and the number of all outstanding options were adjusted by a factor of 1.05488.
The purpose of these adjustments was to preserve the rights of the holders after such a capital change.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised in the year was 16.62 2007: 15.77.
The options outstanding at 31 March 2008 have a range of exercise prices between 6.9 and 15.7 following the rights issue adjustment 2007: 5.1 and 15.3 as follows, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.4 years 2007: 7.5 years.
Following the Rights Issue, this number was adjusted to 958,408, as 5,853 of the options granted lapsed prior to the Rights Issue year ended 31 March 2007: 785,694 on 1 June 2006 and 123,496 on 5 December 2006.
The aggregate of estimated fair values of the options granted on these dates are 3.0m 2007: 1.6m.
The inputs into the Black Scholes model are as follows: 13 June 5 December 1 June For options granted 2007 2006 2006 Exercise price 16.57 15.30 12.34 Expected volatility 25.10% 18.51% 18.51% Expected life 4.98 years 5.14 years 5.14 years Risk free rate 5.00% 4.38% 4.38% Dividend yield 3.90% 3.80% 3.80% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous two years.
The expected life used in the model has been calculated using actual exercise periods over the previous five years.

Following the Rights Issue, this number was adjusted to 375,414.
27,559 of these options have lapsed during the year.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of these options is 4.6m.
The inputs for the Black Scholes model are as follows: 13 June 25 May 2007 2006 Exercise price nil nil Expected volatility 25.10% 18.51% Expected life 6.0 years 6.0 years Risk free rate 5.00% 4.38% Dividend yield 3.90% 3.80% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous two years.
20 per cent of the options granted in May 2006 vest in May 2010 and 20 per cent every subsequent year thereafter until May 2014.
20 per cent of the options granted in June 2007 vest in June 2011 and 20 per cent every subsequent year thereafter until June 2015.
The expected life has thus been calculated by assuming that options are exercised as soon as they vest, there being no exercise cost.
The Group recognised total expenses of 2.5m and 1.5m related to equity settled share based payment transactions in 2008 and 2007 respectively.
25 Financial commitments At 31 March 2008, the Group estimated that it had no contractual obligations to provide further funding apart from an obligation to lend a further 60.9m 2007: 111.0m on four existing investments, one new investment and one co-investment agreement with Intermediate Capital Asia Pacific Mezzanine Fund 2005.
The Group regularly enters into forward contracts for financial instruments which are used to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risk in the normal course of business.

28 Financial assets and liabilities a Treasury and hedging policies The Groups treasury policies seek to manage the following risks.
The Board has reviewed and agreed the changes in the policies during the year ended 31 March 2008. b Interest rate risk The Groups assets include both fixed and floating rate loans and non interest bearing equity investments.
The Groups operations are financed with a combination of shareholders funds, bank borrowings, private placement notes and floating rate notes.
The Group manages its exposure to market interest rate movements by matching, to the extent possible, the interest profiles of assets and liabilities and by using derivative instruments.
As a result, the Group does not have material financial exposure to interest rate movements.

c Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to currency risk in relation to the translation of net assets, currency transactions and the translation of net asset, and profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiaries.
The Groups most significant exposures are to the euro and the US dollar.
The Group manages its exposure to market currency risk by matching assets with debt to the extent possible and through the use of derivative instruments.
The Group regards its interest in overseas subsidiaries as long term investments.
Consequently it does not normally hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the financial statements of these businesses.
The financial assets and liabilities by currency and the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to foreign exchange rates is shown in h page 93.
This is before the effect of derivative instruments.
d Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining headroom on its financing facilities, particularly the bank facility.
e Refinancing risk The Groups policy is to maintain continuity of funding.
Due to the long term nature of the Groups assets the Group seeks to ensure that the maturity of its debt instruments is matched to the expected maturity of its assets.
This has been achieved by the ongoing private placement programme with notes maturing between five and 10 years, short term borrowings under the five year extendable, multi currency bank facility and by issuing floating rate notes.
f Credit risk The Groups policy is to diversify its portfolio in terms of geography, sector and size and has in place disciplined credit procedures both before and during the period of investment to protect its portfolio.

The total carrying amount of these instruments is 197.3m 2007: 107.4m.
The fair value of these warrants and unlisted shares cannot be reliably measured.
The range of estimates within which the aggregate fair value is highly likely to lie is 70m to 110m 2007: 55m to 130m.
Apart from the unlisted shares and warrants held at cost, the following methods and assumptions that were used to estimate the fair values are shown below: Loans and receivables Floating rate loans are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method, less provisions for impairment.
This value is considered by the Directors to be a good approximation for fair value.
92 Intermediate Capital Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Financial Accounts 28 Financial assets and liabilities continued Available for sale investments and warrants fair value is based on quoted prices, where available.
Where quoted prices are not available, the fair value is based on recent significant transactions or an earning based valuation technique.
Where a reliable fair value cannot be established, these are held at cost.
Other derivatives The fair value of the derivatives used for hedging purposes is derived from pricing models which take account of the contract terms, including maturity, as well as quoted market parameters such as interest rates and volatilities.
Revolving credit facility, private placements and secured notes Floating rate loans are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method.
The fair value of fixed rate loans is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows on these instruments at current market interest rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities Due to their short term nature, the Directors consider the carrying value to be a good approximation of fair value.
