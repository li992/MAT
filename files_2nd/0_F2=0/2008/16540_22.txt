Basis of Preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial assets, fixed rate bonds and defined benefit pension obligations that have been measured at fair value.
The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million except where otherwise indicated.
The Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements which is effective from annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the Groups financial instruments and management of capital.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 8 Operating segments IFRS 3 Revised 2008 Business Combinations IFRS 2 Revised 2008 Share-based payment IAS 27 Revised 2008 Consolidated and separate financial statements IAS 1 Revised 2007 Presentation of financial statements IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury share transactions IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes IFRIC 14 The Limit on Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their interaction The management is evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of above standards and interpretations will have on its financial reporting and disclosures.
Parent Company Financial Statements The financial statements of the parent company, Vedanta Resources plc, have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and with UK accounting presentation.
The Company balance sheet is presented in note 40.
2 a aCCounting poliCies basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial information incorporates the results of the Company and all its subsidiaries, being the companies that it controls.
This control is normally evidenced when the Group is able to govern a companys financial and operating policies so as to benefit from its activities or where the Group owns, either directly or indirectly, the majority of a companys equity voting rights unless in exceptional circumstances it can be demonstrated that ownership does not constitute control.
The results of Sesa Goa have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition in April 2007 and the results of Sterlite Gold have been excluded from the date of its disposal in September 2007.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
Adjustments are made to bring any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist in line with Group policy.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
revenue reCognition Revenue represents the net invoice value of goods and services provided to third parties after deducting discounts, volume rebates, outgoing sales taxes and duties, and are recognised usually when all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are transferred to the customer and the commodity has been delivered to the shipping agent.
Revenues from sale of material by-products are included in revenue.
Dividend income is recognised when the shareholders right to receive payment is established.

Certain of our sales contracts provide for provisional pricing based on the price on The London Metal Exchange Limited LME, as specified in the contract, when shipped.
Final settlement of the prices is based on the applicable price for a specified future period.
The Companys provisionally priced sales are marked to market using the relevant forward prices for the future period specified in the contract and same is adjusted in revenue.
speCial items Special items are those items that management considers, by virtue of their size or incidence should be disclosed separately to ensure that the financial information also allows an understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
The determination as to which items should be disclosed separately requires a degree of judgement.
business Combinations The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method.
The acquirers identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Excess purchase consideration, being the difference between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an asset on the balance sheet.
To the extent that such excess purchase consideration relates to the acquisition of mining properties and leases, that amount is capitalised within property, plant and equipment as mining properties and leases.
Other excess purchase consideration relating to the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment annually.
Where the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, the surplus is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of the associate.
The unamortised balance is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the first post-acquisition financial statements are approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any adjustments required to those provisional fair values, and the corresponding adjustments to purchased goodwill, are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
investments in assoCiates In the consolidated financial information, investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies and normally owns between 20.0% and 50.0% of the voting equity but is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above and is included in the carrying value of investments in associate.
The investment is initially recorded at the cost to the Group in the consolidated balance sheet and then, in subsequent periods, the carrying value of the investment is adjusted to reflect the Groups share of the associates profits or losses and for impairment of goodwill and any other changes to the associates net assets.
The consolidated income statement includes the Groups share of associates results, except where the associate is generating losses and the Groups investment in the associate has been written down to zero.

The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, are capitalised as property, plant and equipment under the heading Mining properties and leases in the year in which they are incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining property is viable for commercial production, all further pre-production primary development expenditure other than land, buildings, plant and equipment, etc is capitalised as part of the cost of the mining property until the mining property is capable of commercial production.
From that point, capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised on a unit-of-production basis over the total estimated remaining commercial reserves of each property or group of properties.
Stripping costs secondary development expenditure incurred during the production stage of operations of an ore body is charged to the income statement immediately.
Exploration and evaluation assets acquired are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition subject to meeting the commercial production criteria mentioned above and are subject to impairment review.
In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written off in the period.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable reserves.
Changes in the commercial reserves affecting unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves.
Other Property, Plant and Equipment The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use.
Expenditure incurred after the property, plant and equipment have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance, are normally charged to the income statement in the period in which the costs are incurred.
Major shutdown and overhaul expenditure is capitalised.
Assets in the Course of Construction Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the assets under construction account.
At the point when an asset is operating at managements intended use, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment.
Costs associated with the commissioning of an asset and any obligatory decommissioning costs are capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels until a period of commissioning has been completed.
depreCiation Mining properties and other assets in the course of development or construction, freehold land and goodwill are not depreciated.
Capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised once commercial production commences, as described in Property, plant and equipment mining properties and leases.
Leasehold land and buildings are depreciated over the period of the lease.
Other buildings, plant and equipment, office equipment and fixtures, and motor vehicles are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Buildings: Operations 30 years Administration 50 years Plant and equipment 1020 years Office equipment and fixtures 320 years Motor vehicles 911 years VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 103 Job: 10808 VED 08 back AW.

The carrying amount of the remaining previous overhaul cost is charged to the income statement if the next overhaul is undertaken earlier than the previously estimated life of the economic benefit.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale or which is part of a disposal group held for sale is not depreciated.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale is carried at the lower of its carrying value and fair value less disposal cost and is presented separately on the face of the balance sheet.
non-Current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
impairment The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and investments in associates are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually.
If there are indicators of impairment, an assessment is made to determine whether the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
Whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is charged to the income statement.
The Group reviews the residual value and useful life of an asset at least at each financial year-end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the change s is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.
For mining properties and leases, investments in associates, other investments and goodwill, the recoverable amount of an asset is determined on the basis of its value in use, being the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life, discounted using a market-based, risk-adjusted, discount rate.
For other property, plant and equipment, the recoverable amount of an asset is also considered on the basis of its net realisable value, where it is possible to assess the amount that could be obtained from the sale of an asset in an arms length transaction, less the cost of disposal.
Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if this is not possible, for the relevant cash-generating unit.
government grants Government grants relating to tangible fixed assets are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Other grants are credited to the income statement as and when the related expenditure is incurred.
inventories Inventories and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less any provision for obsolescence.
Cost is determined on the following bases: purchased copper concentrate is recorded at cost on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis: all other materials including stores and spares are valued on weighted average basis: finished products are valued at raw material cost plus costs of conversion, comprising labour costs and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity: and by-products and scrap are valued at net realisable value.
Net realisable value is determined based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.

Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Exceptions to this principle are: Tax payable on the future remittance of the past earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: Deferred income tax is not recognised on goodwill impairment which is not deductible for tax purposes or on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant Group entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
retirement benefit sChemes The Group operates or participates in a number of defined benefits and contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are where funded held in separately administered funds.
The cost of providing benefits under the plans is determined each year separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method by independent qualified actuaries.
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are recognised in full in the income statement of the year.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year.
share-based paYments Certain employees including Directors of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined by an external valuer and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the current expectations.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
provisions for liabilities and Charges Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive, as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the income statement as a finance cost.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

Costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to net present value, are provided for and a corresponding amount is capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
These costs are charged to the income statement over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision.
The cost estimates are reviewed periodically and are adjusted to reflect known developments which may have an impact on the cost estimates or life of operations.
The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision due to factors such as updated cost estimates, changes to lives of operations, new disturbance and revisions to discount rates.
The adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which they relate.
The unwinding of the discount is shown as a finance cost in the income statement.
Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is caused on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present values and charged to the income statement as extraction progresses.
Where the costs of site restoration are not anticipated to be material, they are expensed as incurred.
leases Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
foreign CurrenCY translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
For all principal operating subsidiaries, the functional currency is the local currency of the country in which it operates, except KCM wherein the functional currency is US dollars, since that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
In the financial statements of individual Group companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated into functional currency at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are included in the income statement.
For the purposes of consolidation, the income statement items of those entities for which the US dollar is not the functional currency are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange during the period.
The related balance sheets are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of such operations, and on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they hedge the Groups investment in such operations, are reported in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative exchange differences recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation would be recognised in the income statement.
finanCial asset investments Financial asset investments are classified as available for sale under IAS 39 and are initially recorded at cost and then remeasured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value.
Unrealised gains and losses on financial asset investments are recognised directly in equity.
On disposal or impairment of the investments, the gains and losses in equity are recycled into the income statement.
Investments in unquoted equity instruments that do not have a market price and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost.
Equity investments are recorded in non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year.
liQuid investments Liquid investments represent short-term current asset investments that do not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents for one or more of the following reasons: they have a maturity profile greater than 90 days: and or they may be subject to a greater risk of changes in value than cash: and or they are held of investment purposes.
The change in fair value of trading investments incorporates any dividend and interest earned on the held for trading investments.

trade paYables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
eQuitY instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Cash and Cash eQuivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits with banks and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.
borrowings Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the income statement using the effective interest method.
They are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Convertible bonds The Vedanta convertible bond is accounted for as a compound instrument.
The equity component and the liability component was separated out on the date of the issue.
The equity component has been recognised in a separate reserve and is not being subsequently remeasured.
The liability component is held at amortised cost.
The interest expensed on the liability component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate, being the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between this amount and interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the liability component.
borrowing Costs Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time that the assets are substantially ready for their intended use, ie when they are capable of commercial production.
Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.
Where surplus funds are available out of money borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from such short-term investments is also capitalised and reduced from the total capitalised borrowing cost.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
derivative finanCial instruments In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, the Group enters into forward, option, swap contracts and other derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair value on the date of the derivative transaction and are re-measured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement.
The hedged item is recorded at fair value and any gain or loss is recorded in the income statement and is offset by the gain or loss from the change in the fair value of the derivative.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in equity.
Amounts deferred to equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market at the balance sheet date and gains or losses are recognised in the income statement immediately.

Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the year.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
2 b CritiCal aCCounting judgement and estimation unCertaintY In the course of applying the policies outlined in note 2 a, management made estimations and assumptions that impact the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Vedanta believes that judgement and estimation has been made in the following areas: mining properties and leases The carrying value of mining property and leases is arrived at by depreciating the assets over the life of the mine using the unit of production method based on proved and probable reserves.
The estimate of reserves is subject to assumptions relating to life of the mine and may change when new information becomes available.
Changes in reserves as a result of factors such as production cost, recovery rates, grade of reserves or commodity prices could impact the depreciation rates, asset carrying values and environmental and restoration provisions.
useful eConomiC lives of assets and impairment Property, plant and equipment other than mining properties and leases are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Management reviews the useful economic lives at least once a year and any changes could affect the depreciation rates prospectively and hence the asset carrying values.
The Group also reviews its property, plant and equipment, including mining properties and leases, for possible impairment if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable.
In assessing the property, plant and equipment for impairment, factors leading to significant reduction in profits such as changes in commodity prices, the Groups business plans and significant downward revision in the estimated mining reserves are taken into consideration.
The carrying value of the assets of a cash generating unit CGU and associated mining reserves is compared with the recoverable amount of those assets, that is, the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Value in use is usually determined on the basis of discounted estimated future cash flows.
This involves management estimates on commodity prices, market demand and supply, economic and regulatory climates, long-term mine plan and other factors.
Any subsequent changes to cash flow due to changes in the above mentioned factors could impact on the carrying value of the assets.
restoration, rehabilitation and environmental Costs Provision is made for costs associated with restoration and rehabilitation of mining sites as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
Such restoration and closure costs are typical of extractive industries and they are normally incurred at the end of the life of the mine.
The costs are estimated on the basis of mine closure plans and the estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities and the costs of restoration are capitalised when incurred reflecting our obligations at that time.
A corresponding provision is created on the liability side.
The capitalised asset is charged to the income statement over the life of the asset through depreciation over the life of the operation and the provision is increased each period via unwinding the discount on the provision.
Management estimates are based on local legislation and or other agreements such as the KCM acquisition agreement.
The actual costs and cash outflows may differ from estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, changes in prices, analysis of site conditions and changes in restoration technology.
As per local legislation, our Indian operations provide for restoration costs in accordance with statutory requirements.
In Australia, appropriate provision has been made in accordance with local legal requirements and at KCM, a provision has been recognised with reference to a plan agreed with the Government of Zambia at the time of KCMs privatisation in April 2000 and pursuant to the KCM acquisition agreement.
provisions and liabilities Provisions and liabilities are recognised in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a future outflow of funds resulting from past operations or events that can be reasonably estimated.
The timing of recognition requires the application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances which may be subject to change.
The actual cash outflows takes place over many years in the future and hence the carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account the changing circumstances and other factors that influence the provisions and liabilities.

Where the potential liabilities have a low probability of crystallising or are very difficult to quantify reliably, we treat them as contingent liabilities.
Such liabilities are disclosed in the notes but are not provided for in the financial statements.
Although there can be no assurance regarding the final outcome of the legal proceedings, we do not expect them to have a materially adverse impact on our financial position or profitability.
underlYing earnings and speCial items In addition to the financial statements, we present underlying earnings after adjusting for special items as an additional measure of performance in order to provide a better understanding of the underlying business operational results.
Such special items are generally non-recurring in nature and are disclosed separately in the financial statements.
Identification of such items involves a degree of judgement by the management.
3. segment information The Groups primary format for segmental reporting is business segments.
The business segments consist of aluminium, copper, zinc and iron ore, with residual components being reported as Other mainly energy and gold.
Business segment data includes an allocation of certain directly attributable corporate costs, allocated on an appropriate basis.
The risks and returns of the Groups operations are primarily determined by the nature of the different activities in which the Group is engaged.
Inter-segment sales are charged based on prevailing market prices.
The Groups activities are organised on a global basis.
Our alumina operations in VAL were disclosed as part of other in financial year 2007.

There is no concept of tax consolidation or Group relief in India.
Companies are charged tax on profits of assessment years which run from 1 April to 31 March.
For each assessment year, a companys profits will be subject to either regular income tax or Minimum Alternative Tax MAT, whichever is the greater.
Regular income tax is charged on book profits prepared under Indian GAAP adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act.
Typically the required adjustments generate significant timing differences in respect of the depreciation on fixed assets, relief for provisions and accruals, the use of tax losses brought forward and pension costs.
Regular income tax is charged at 30.0% plus a surcharge and cess taking the effective tax rate to 33.99%.
The corporate tax rate for 200809 has been retained at 33.99%.
MAT is charged on the book profits but typically with a limited number of adjustments.
MAT is charged at 10.0% plus a surcharge and cess.
The effective rate of MAT is 11.33%.
However, MAT paid during a year can be set off against normal tax payable in the subsequent years but within a period of seven years succeeding the assessment year in which the MAT credit arose.
Investments in projects where alternative energy is generated are subject to accelerated depreciation whereby 80.0% of the investment is depreciated in the first year.
There are various tax exemptions or tax holidays available to companies in India subject to fulfilment of prescribed conditions.
The most important ones applicable to the Group are: the industrial undertakings exemption.
Profits of newly constructed industrial undertakings located in designated areas of India can benefit from a tax holiday.
A typical tax holiday would exempt 100.0% of the plants profits for five years, and 30.0% for the next five years: the power plants exemption.
Profits on newly constructed power plants can benefit from a tax holiday.
A typical holiday would exempt 100.0% of profits in 10 consecutive years within the first 15 years of the power plants operation.
The start of the 10-year period can be chosen by a company: Industrial undertakings located in certain designated areas would be exempt from paying taxes for 10 consecutive assessment years beginning with the year of operation: and Profits from units designated as an EOU, from where goods are exported out of India, are exempt from tax upto March 2010.
Tax is payable in the financial year to which it relates.
Tax returns submitted by companies are regularly subjected to a comprehensive review and challenge by the tax authorities.
There are appeals procedures prescribed.
Both the tax authorities and taxpayers can prefer appeals to the appellate forums and it is not uncommon for significant or complex matters in dispute to remain outstanding for several years before they are finally resolved either in the High Court or in the Supreme Court.
overview of the Zambian tax regime The following is an overview of the salient features of the Zambian direct tax regime relevant to the taxation of the Group: Copper and cobalt mining companies pay income tax at 25.0%.
The period for carry forward of tax losses for KCM is 20 years.
Companies are charged tax on profits of accounting years.
Income tax is charged on book profits prepared under IFRS adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1996 as amended.
Zambian income tax laws have been amended with effect from 1 April 2008 and the salient features of the new tax laws are: The tax rate for mining companies has been increased to 30.0% for profits generated from 1 April 2008 Capital expenditure deduction which is currently made at 100.0% in the year of incurrence, is being reduced to 25.0% per annum, with the following transitional position: 75.0% of the expenditure incurred in 20082009 will be allowed as a deduction in that year and the balance will be deducted in full in 20092010: 50.0% of the expenditure incurred in 20092010 will be allowed as a deduction in that year and the balance will be deducted in two equal annual instalments in 2010 and 2011.
New tax has been introduced in the form of either windfall tax or variable profit tax: Windfall tax becomes payable when copper is sold at prices above $5,512 per MT.
The tax is charged at rates ranging from 25.0% to 75.0% of differential between the realised price and specific price thresholds ranging upward from $5,512 per MT.
Windfall tax is not a deductible expense in the computation of income tax: and Variable profit tax becomes payable where income from mining activities exceeds 8.0% of gross sales at a rate determined according to a prescribed formula and payable only if windfall tax is not payable.
The period available to carry forward losses has been reduced from 20 years to 10 years.

Convertible bonds Vedanta Finance Jersey Limited VFJL issued $725.0 million of 4.6% guaranteed convertible bonds on 21 February 2006.
The bonds are first convertible into exchangeable redeemable preference shares to be issued by VFJL, which will then be automatically exchanged for ordinary shares of Vedanta Resources plc represented by depository receipts, which do not carry voting rights.
The bondholders have the option to convert at any time from 17 April 2006 to 15 February 2026.
The loan notes are convertible at 14.54 per share of US$0.10 each and at sterling to US dollar rate of 1.7845.
If the notes have not been converted, they will be redeemed at the option of the Company on or at any time after 14 March 2009 and on or prior to 15 February 2026, subject to the conditions as part of the issue, or be redeemed at the option of the bondholders on 21 February 2013, 21 February 2018 and 21 February 2022.
The net proceeds of the convertible issue have been split between the liability and equity components.
The equity component represents the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company.
The liability component is held at amortised cost: Year ended Year ended 31 march 2008 31 March 2007 $ million $ million opening liabilitY 598.4 600.4 Additional issue costs incurred 1.7 Interest and amortisation of issue costs note 6 36.9 36.7 Coupon interest paid 33.3 33.4 Conversion of bonds 1.1 0.1 Other 3.5 31 marCh 600.9 598.4 The interest charged for the year is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 6.16% 2007: 6.18%.
During the year ended 31 March 2008, $1.3 million of convertible bonds were converted into 50,169 equity shares, reducing the liability component of the convertible bonds by $1.1 million, generating share capital and share premium of $1.3 million and releasing $0.2 million from convertible bond reserve.
During the year ended 31 March 2008, $3.6 million was transferred from the convertible bond reserve to retained earnings, representing the realisation of distributable reserves following accretion of the convertible bond liability.
This amount constitutes the accretion during the year, being the interest and amortisation of issue costs, less coupon interest as outlined in the table above.
The fair value of the convertible bonds as on 31 March 2008 is $667.2 million 2007: $615.1 million.

derivatives instruments and risk management The Groups businesses are subject to several risks and uncertainties including financial risks.
The Groups documented risk management policies act as an effective tool in mitigating the various financial risks to which the businesses are exposed to in the course of their daily operations.
The risk management policies cover areas such as liquidity risk, commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and capital management.
Risks are identified through a formal risk management programme with active involvement of senior management personnel and business managers at both the corporate and individual subsidiary level.
Each operating subsidiary in the Group has in place risk management processes which are in line with the Groups policy.
Each significant risk has a designated owner within the Group at an appropriate senior level.
The potential financial impact of the risk and its likelihood of a negative outcome are regularly updated.
The risk management process is coordinated by the Management Assurance function and is regularly reviewed by the Groups Audit Committee.
Key business decisions are discussed at the monthly meetings of the Executive Committee.
The overall internal control environment and risk management programme including financial risk management is reviewed by the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board.

The treasury policies are approved by the Board and adherence to these policies is strictly monitored at the Executive Committee meetings.
Day-to-day treasury operations of the subsidiary companies are managed by their respective finance teams within the framework of the overall Group treasury policies.
Long-term fund raising including strategic treasury initiatives are handled by a central team while short-term funding for routine working capital requirements is delegated to subsidiary companies.
A monthly reporting system exists to inform senior management of investments, debt, currency, commodity and interest rate derivatives.
The Group has a strong system of internal control which enables effective monitoring of adherence to Group policies.
The internal control measures are effectively supplemented by regular internal audits.
The Group uses derivative instruments as part of its management of exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The Group does not acquire or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The Group does not enter into complex derivative transactions to manage the treasury and commodity risks.
Both treasury and commodities derivative transactions are normally in the form of forward contracts and interest rate and currency swaps and these are subject to the Group guidelines and policies.
Interest rate swaps are taken to achieve a balance between fixed and floating rates as described below under Interest rate Risks and currency swaps are taken primarily to convert the Groups exposure to non-US dollar currencies to US dollar currencies.
CommoditY risk The Group is exposed to the movement of base metal commodity prices on the London Metal Exchange.
Any decline in the prices of the base metals that the Group produces and sells will have an immediate and direct impact on the profitability of the businesses.
As a general policy, the Group aims to sell the products at prevailing market prices.
As much as possible, the Group tries to mitigate price risk through favourable contractual terms.
The Group undertakes hedging activity in commodities to a limited degree.
Hedging is used primarily as a risk management tool and, in some cases, to secure future cash flows in cases of high volatility by entering into forward contracts or similar instruments.
The hedging activities are subject to strict limits set out by the Board and to a strictly defined internal control and monitoring mechanism.
Decisions relating to hedging of commodities are taken at the Executive Committee level and with clearly laid down guidelines for their implementation by the subsidiaries.
Whilst the Group aims to achieve average LME prices for a month or a year, average realised prices may not necessarily reflect the LME price movements because of a variety of reasons such as uneven sales during the year.
Copper The Groups custom smelting copper operations at Tuticorin is benefited by a natural hedge except to the extent of a possible mismatch in quotational periods between the purchase of concentrate and the sale of finished copper.
The Groups policy on custom smelting is to generate margins from TC RCs, minimising conversion cost, premium over LME on sale of finished copper, sale of by-products and from achieving import parity on domestic sales.
Hence, mismatches in quotational periods are actively managed to ensure that the gains or losses are minimised.
The Group hedges this variability of LME prices and tries to make the LME price a pass-through cost between purchases of copper concentrate and sales of finished products, both of which are linked to the LME price.
The Company also benefits from the difference between the amounts paid for quantities of copper contents received and recovered in the manufacturing process, also known as `free copper.
The Group hedges on a selective basis the free copper and revenue from variable margins on the purchases of copper concentrates by entering into future contracts.
The Groups Australian mines in Tasmania supply approximately 7.0% to 8.0% of the requirement of the custom copper smelter at Tuticorin.
Hence, TC RCs are a major source of income for the Indian copper smelting operations.
Fluctuations in TC RCs are influenced by factors including demand and supply conditions prevailing in the market for mine output.
The Groups Copper business has a strategy of securing a majority of its concentrate feed requirement under long-term contracts with mines.
KCM is largely an integrated copper producer and hence the strategy to protect the Company from price fluctuations in copper is to focus on controlling KCMs costs.
For the mining assets in Australia and Zambia, part of the production may be hedged to secure cash flows on a selective basis.

The Group enjoys good ratings from reputed international rating agencies including Standard & Poors and Moodys.
The Groups current ratings from Standard & Poors and Moodys are BB and Baa3 respectively.
These ratings support the necessary financial leverage and access to debt or equity markets at competitive terms.

The majority of the assets are located in India and the Indian rupee is the functional currency for the Indian operating subsidiaries.
Foreign currency exposures are managed through the Group-wide hedging policy, which is reviewed periodically to ensure that the risk from fluctuating currency exchange rates is appropriately managed.
Natural hedges available in the business are identified at each entity level and hedges are placed only for the net exposure.
Short-term net exposures are hedged progressively based on their maturity.
A more conservative approach has been adopted for project expenditures to avoid budget overruns.
Stop losses and take profit triggers are implemented to protect entities from adverse market movements at the same time enabling them to encash in favourable market opportunities.
Vedanta has hedged some of its US dollar borrowings into other foreign currency borrowings by entering into cross currency swaps.

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on short-term and long-term floating rate instruments and on the refinancing of fixed rate debt.
The Groups policy is to maintain a balance of fixed and floating interest rate borrowings and the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt is determined by current market interest rates.
As at 31 March 2008, 29.0% 2007: 52.0% of the total debt was at a fixed rate and the balance was at a floating rate.
The floating rate debt is largely linked to US dollar LIBOR.
The Group also aims to minimise its average interest rates on borrowings by opting for a higher proportion of long-term debt to fund growth projects.
In certain circumstances, interest rate swaps are taken to minimise the impact of rising floating rates.
The Group invests cash and liquid investments in short-term deposits and debt mutual funds, some of which generate a tax-free return, to achieve the Groups goal of maintaining liquidity, carrying manageable risk and achieving satisfactory returns.
Floating rate financial assets are largely mutual fund investments which have debt securities as underlying asset.
The returns from these financial assets are linked to market interest rate movements: however the counterparty invests in the agreed securities with known maturity tenure and return and hence have manageable risk.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets to interest rate risk is as follows: at 31 march 2008 At 31 March 2007 non-interest Non-interest floating rate fixed rate bearing Floating rate Fixed rate bearing financial financial equity financial financial financial Equity financial $ million assets assets investments assets assets assets investments assets Financial assets 4,677.9 635.7 30.0 871.0 1,258.9 1,271.7 30.1 629.3 Derivative assets 139.8 123.6 total finanCial assets 4,677.9 635.7 30.0 1,010.8 1,258.9 1,271.7 30.1 752.9 The exposure of the Groups financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: at 31 march 2008 At 31 March 2007 non-interest Non-interest floating rate fixed rate bearing Floating rate Fixed rate bearing financial financial financial financial financial financial $ million liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities Financial liabilities 2,723.4 924.9 1,344.4 1,289.3 902.7 718.8 Derivative liabilities 107.0 196.2 total finanCial liabilities 2,723.4 924.9 1,451.4 1,289.3 902.7 915.0 The weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate financial liabilities is 6.5% 2007: 6.1% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 3.9 years 2007: 5.9 years.
Considering the net cash position as at 31 March 2008 and the investment in bank deposits and debt mutual funds, any increase in interest rates would result in a net gain and any decrease in interest rates would result in a net loss.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and nonderivative instruments at the balance sheet date.

The Group has clearly defined policies to mitigate counterparty risks.
Cash and liquid investments are held primarily in mutual funds and banks with high credit ratings.
Defined limits are in place for exposure to individual counterparties in case of mutual fund houses and banks.
The large majority of receivables due from third parties are secured.
Moreover, given the diverse nature of our businesses, trade receivables are spread over a number of customers with no significant concentration of credit risk.
No single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of the Groups net sales or for any of the Groups primary businesses during the year ended 31 March 2008 and in the previous year.
The history of trade receivables shows a negligible provision for bad and doubtful debts.
Therefore, the Group does not expect any material risk on account of nonperformance by any of our counterparties.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March 2008 is $6,324.4 million 2007: $3,279.0 million.

Non-qualifying Hedges The majority of these derivatives comprise copper sale and purchase contracts at Sterlite custom smelting operations which are economic hedges but which do not fulfil the requirements for hedge accounting of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Fair Value Hedges The fair value hedges relate to interest rate swaps fixed to floating taken out by the Group to hedge the fair value risk on the $600.0 million bonds due in 2010.
The Group has also entered into US dollar and Japanese yen cross-currency swaps with a maturity of 2010.
Equal and opposite swaps are held in two Group companies, such that no significant net exposure to the Group arises.

Three employee share schemes were approved by shareholders on Listing.
The Board has no present intention to introduce any further share schemes.
the vedanta resourCes long-term inCentive plan the ltip The LTIP is the primary arrangement under which share-based incentives are provided to the Executive Directors and the wider management group.
The maximum value of shares that can be conditionally awarded to an Executive Director in a year is 100.0% of annual salary.
In respect of Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kuldip Kaura, salary means the aggregate of their salary payable by Vedanta and their gross salary payable by Sterlite.
The maximum value of shares that can be awarded to members of the wider management group is calculated by reference to the base salary, share-based remuneration already received and consistent with local market practice.
The performance condition attaching to outstanding awards under the LTIP is that the Companys performance, measured in terms of Total Shareholder Return TSR being the movement in a companys share price plus reinvested dividends, is compared over the performance period with the performance of the companies as defined in the scheme from the date of grant.
The extent to which an award vests will depend on the Companys TSR rank against a group of peer companies Adapted Comparator Group at the end of the performance period.
The vesting schedule is shown in the table below, with adjusted straight-line vesting in between the points shown and rounding down to the nearest whole share.
vedantas tsr performanCe against adapted Comparator group % of award vesting Below median At median 40 At or above upper quartile 100 The performance condition will be measured by taking the Companys TSR over the four weeks immediately preceding the date of grant and over the four weeks immediately preceding the end of the performance period, and comparing its performance with that of the comparator group described above.
The information to enable this calculation to be carried out on behalf of the Remuneration Committee the Committee will be provided by the Companys advisers.
The Committee considers that this performance condition, which requires that the Companys total return has out-performed a group of companies chosen to represent the mining sector, provides a reasonable alignment of the interests of the Executive Directors and the wider management group with those of the shareholders.
No awards will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR performance reasonably reflects the Companys underlying financial performance.
Initial awards under the LTIP were granted on 26 February 2004 with further awards being made on 11 June 2004, 23 November 2004, 1 February 2006, 1 February 2007 and 14 November 2007.
The exercise price of the awards is 10 US cents per share and the performance period is one year for the February 2007 awards and three years for all other awards, with no re-testing being allowed.
The exercise period is six months from the date of vesting.
Further details on the LTIP are found in the Remuneration Report on pages 83 to 89.
The weighted average share price for the share options exercised during the year was 18.60.

The fair value of these awards has been determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the effect of any market-based performance conditions.
This fair value, adjusted by the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest as a result of non-market conditions, is expensed uniformly over the vesting period.
The fair values were calculated using a Monte Carlo model with suitable modifications to allow for the specific performance conditions of the LTIP.
The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends and the risk free rate of interest.
A progressive dividend growth policy is assumed in all fair value calculations.
Expected volatility has been calculated using historical share prices over the period to date of grant that is commensurate with the performance period of the option.
The share prices of the mining companies in the Adapted Comparator Group have been modelled based on historical price movements over the period to date of grant which is also commensurate with the performance period for the option.
The history of share prices is used to determine the volatility and correlation of share prices for the companies in the Adapted Comparator Group and is needed for the Monte Carlo simulation of their future TSR performance relative to the Companys TSR performance.
All options are assumed to be exercised six weeks after vesting.
The assumptions used in the calculations of the charge in respect of the LTIP awards granted during the year are set out below: LTIP November 2007 Date of grant 14 November 2007 Number of instruments 1,691,349 Exercise price $0.10 Share price at the date of grant 19.69 Contractual life 3 years Expected volatility 43.0% pa Expected option life 3.5 years Expected dividends 1.0% pa Risk free interest rate 4.7% pa Expected annual forfeitures 13.5% pa Fair value per option granted 9.207 30. retirement benefits The Group operates pension schemes for the majority of its employees in India, Australia and Zambia.
a defined Contribution sChemes indian Pension Schemes Central Provident Fund The Central Provident Fund relates to all full time Indian employees of the Group.
The amount contributed by the Group is a designated percentage of 12.0% of basic salary less contributions made as part of the Pension Fund see below, together with an additional contribution of 12.0% of salary made by the employee.
The benefit is paid to the employee on their retirement or resignation from the Group.
Superannuation Superannuation, another pension scheme applicable in India, is applicable only to senior executives.
Each relevant company holds a policy with the Life Insurance Corporation of India LIC, to which each company contributes a fixed amount relating to superannuation, and the pension annuity is met by the LIC as required, taking into consideration the contributions made.
Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a defined contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the income statement.
Pension Fund The Pension Fund was established in 1998 and is managed by the government.
The employee makes no contribution to this fund but the employer makes a contribution of 8.33% of salary each month subject to a specified ceiling per employee.
This must be provided for every permanent employee on the payroll.
At the age of superannuation, contributions cease and the individual receives a monthly payment based on the level of contributions through the years, and on their salary scale at the time they retire, subject to a maximum ceiling of salary level.
The government funds these payments, thus the Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of whether the central fund is in surplus or deficit.

The contribution of a proportion of an employees salary into a superannuation fund is a compulsory legal requirement in Australia.
The employer contributes 9.0% of the employees gross remuneration where the employee is covered by the industrial agreement and 12.0% of the basic remuneration for all other employees, into the employees fund of choice.
All employees have the option to make additional voluntary contributions.
Zambian Pension Scheme The KCM Pension Scheme is applicable to full time permanent employees of KCM subject to the fulfilment of certain eligibility criteria.
The management of the scheme is vested in the trustees consisting of representatives of the employer and the members.
The employer makes a monthly contribution to the KCM Pension Scheme of an amount equal to 11.0% of that months pensionable salary and the member makes monthly contributions to the fund of an amount equal to 5.0% of that months pensionable salary.
All contributions to the KCM Pension Scheme in respect of a member cease to be payable when the member attains normal retirement age of 55 years, or upon leaving the service of the employer, or when the member is permanently medically incapable of performing duties in the service of the employer.
Upon such cessation of contribution on the grounds of normal retirement, or being rendered medically incapable of performing duties, or early voluntary retirement within five years of retirement, the member is entitled to receive an immediate annual pension equal to his accrued pension.
The member is allowed to commute his her accrued pension subject to certain rules and regulations.
The trustees of the KCM Pension Scheme may also allow the purchase of an annuity for the benefit of members from a life assurance company or other providers of annuities, subject to statutory regulations.
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of whether the KCM Pension Scheme is in surplus or deficit.
b defined benefit sChemes india The Gratuity schemes are defined benefit schemes which are open to all Group employees in India who have a minimum of five years of service with their employing company.
These schemes are funded by the Group in some subsidiaries.
Based on actuarial valuation, a provision is recognised for the projected obligation over and above the funds held in scheme.
In case there is no funding against the scheme, full provision is recognised in the Balance Sheet.
Under these schemes, benefits are provided based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds and a full actuarial valuation of the schemes is carried out on an annual basis.
MALCO MALCO does not contribute to the LIC.
Its Gratuity scheme is accounted for on a defined benefit basis.

Commitments, guarantees and ContingenCies CONTiNUED MALCO claims with TECHMO Car SpA TECHMO In February 1999, MALCO entered into an agreement with TECHMO to modernise the smelter pot rooms at Mettur Dam.
In February 2003, this contract was terminated by TECHMO following disputes over the project.
In March 2003, MALCO issued a claim against TECHMO to recover expenditure incurred on the project, citing non-performance by TECHMO.
The value of this claim was $6.3 million.
The District Court had ordered TECHMO to provide the full amount of the claim to MALCO as security, which was subsequently reversed by the Madras High Court.
MALCO filed a petition with the Supreme Court of India, which as an interim measure directed both parties to arbitration and for each party to furnish security of $1.0 million.
Separately, in June 2003, TECHMO moved for arbitration, claiming a total of $3.0 million being the unpaid portion of the contract.
In September 2005, the final part of the hearing took place in which both parties made written submissions.

Sterlite exercised this option on 19 March 2004.
However, the government of India has contested the purchase price and validity of the option.
The Group sought an interim order from the High Court of Delhi to restrain the Government of India from transferring or disposing of its shareholding pending resolution of the dispute.
However, the Court directed on 7 August 2006 that the parties attempt to settle the dispute by way of amicable negotiation and conciliation.
As directed by the court, mediation proceedings were conducted and the Group believes that the mediation process has been completed.
The Group is now awaiting further communication from the Government of India on this matter.
