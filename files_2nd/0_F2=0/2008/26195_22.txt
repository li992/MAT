com The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. 68 Notes to the notice of annual general meeting 1.
A member who holds ordinary shares on the register of members and is entitled to attend and vote at this meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll, to vote in his or her place.
A proxy need not be a member of the Corporation.
Proxy rights do not apply to nominated persons although the nominated person may have a right under an agreement with the registered member to appoint a proxy.
In addition to instructing a proxy to vote for or against a resolution, the form enables you to instruct a vote withheld if you prefer.
A vote withheld is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of votes.
It may be used, for example, to convey a message of dissatisfaction on a particular issue, where the strength of feeling is not so great as to oppose the resolution, but supporting it is not appropriate either.
If you hold your shares on the register of members as opposed to holding them in a nominee, you will find enclosed a form of proxy for use at the meeting.
To be valid, forms of proxy must be lodged at the office of the Corporations registrar, Computershare Investor Services plc, P. O.
Box 1075, Bristol BS99 3ZZ, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting.
Lodgement of a form of proxy will not prevent a member from attending and voting in person.
The register of directors interests will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Corporation during normal business hours and at the annual general meeting.
No director has a service contract with the Corporation of more than one years duration.
Subject to the dividend on the ordinary shares now recommended being approved at the annual general meeting, dividends will be paid on 22 April 2009 to shareholders on the register on the record date on 13 March 2009.
Resolution 2 is to receive and approve the directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The remuneration report is set out at pages 30 to 35 of the annual report of the Corporation.
NB Commencing at this years AGM, all directors are required to seek re-election each year.
Resolution 4: Mr D. C. P. McDougall offers himself for re-election.
The board supports his re-election because he leads the board with skill and considerable success.
He is highly regarded in the investment trust sector and makes a full contribution to the board, with particular expertise in overseeing investment strategy.
His biography is included on page 5 of the annual report.
Resolution 5: Mr A. C. Cates offers himself for re-election.
The board supports his re-election because Mr Cates continues to perform well as senior non-executive director as evidenced in his appraisal by the Chairman.
His extensive knowledge of corporate trusts is valued and he is an informed and expert chairman of the principal holding company for the independent advisory services business.
Resolution 6: Mrs C. J. Banszky offers herself for re-election.
The board supports her re-election.
She continues to be a very effective managing director, considerably improving profitability of the independent fiduciary services business and enhancing shareholder value.
Her biography is included on page 5 of the annual report.
Resolution 7: Professor John Kay offers himself for re-election.
The board supports his re-election.
He provides a valuable insight into economic events and trends, and is an effective audit committee chairman.
Resolution 8 is to elect Mr C. Smith.
He was appointed by the board with effect from 1 March 2009 see page 21.
Until recently, a Managing Director - Corporate Finance for JPMorgan Cazenove, he brings a wealth of corporate finance experience to the board along with a thorough knowledge of the investment trust sector and regulatory matters.
The board is confident that he will make a valuable contribution to the groups activities.
Resolution 9 is to appoint BDO Stoy Hayward LLP as the Corporations auditors.
BDO Stoy Hayward LLP were appointed on 31 October 2008 replacing the resigning auditors, PKF UK LLP, who had been the Corporations auditors since October 2002.
Special resolution 10 renews the authority given to directors at the last annual general meeting to purchase ordinary shares in the market for cancellation.
Such purchases at appropriate times and prices could be a suitable method of enhancing shareholder value and would be applied within guidelines set from time to time by the board.
It should be noted that no such purchases would be undertaken if shares were trading at a premium to net asset value.
Special resolution 11 renews the authority given to directors at the last annual general meeting to allot unissued capital not exceeding 5,901,701 shares, being 5% of the issued share capital.
This authority is sought principally to allow the directors to satisfy demand for shares from participants in the Individual Savings Account, and would be exercised only at times when it would be advantageous to the Corporations shareholders to do so.
Shares would not be issued under this authority at a price lower than net asset value at the time of the issue.
If approved, the authority will continue to operate until the next annual general meeting.
Special resolution 12 is proposed because the directors consider that in order to allot shares in the circumstances described in resolution 11 it is in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders to allot a maximum of 5,901,701 shares other than on a pre-emptive basis.
The board would not, however, issue more than 7.5% of the issued share capital on a non-preemptive basis within any three year period.
