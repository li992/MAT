ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and the AIC Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Investment Trusts dated January 2003 and revised in December 2005. a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments at fair value and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted.
A resolution proposing the continuation of the Company as an investment trust will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 19 May 2009.
The Directors are recommending that shareholders vote in favour of this resolution.
In light of their recommendation and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18 Accounting Policies, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Accordingly the financial statements do not include any adjustments that may arise from a reconstruction or liquidation of the Company.
Such adjustments would include expenses of reconstruction or liquidation along with any costs associated with realising the portfolio.
b Income Income from equity investments is credited to the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Interest receivable on fixed interest securities is accounted for on an accruals basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate on the security.
Franked dividends are accounted for net of any tax credit.
Unfranked investment income includes tax deducted at source.
Interest receivable on short term loans and deposits is dealt with on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash foregone, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
c Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a capital receipt or a revenue receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement with the exception of the performance fee which is charged wholly to capital reserve realised as it arises mainly from capital returns on the portfolio.
Finance costs are accounted for using the effective interest method and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
e Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
f Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserves - realised and unrealised.
g Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors and other key management personnel.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost and subsequently, the investments are valued at fair value, which is measured as follows: Listed investments are valued at bid prices, where the bid price is available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations: Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2008 Page 37 Notes to the Financial Statements Unlisted investments where there is not an active market are valued using an appropriate valuation technique so as to establish what the transaction price would have been at the balance sheet date.
Transaction costs - FRS26: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement requires that the cost of purchasing investments be recognised and accounted for as a separate item from investment gains.
However in accordance with the AIC SORP the Company includes these costs in the cost of investments purchased and has disclosed them in Note 9 on pages 41 and 42. h Fidelity Institutional The Company holds an investment in Fidelity Institutional Cash Fund plc - Euro Fund Cash Fund plc the Fund.
The Fund invests in low risk short term investments.
It is a distributing fund and accordingly the interest earned within the Fund is treated as income.
i Loans Loans are initially included in the financial statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.
After initial recognition, the loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
j Capital reserve realised Gains and losses on the realisation of investments and realised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - realised, via the capital column of the Income Statement.
Capital reserve unrealised Changes in the fair value of investments held at the year end and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - unrealised, via the capital column of the Income Statement.
k Dividends In accordance with FRS21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date dividends declared and approved by the Company after the balance sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the balance sheet date.

This note is incorporated in accordance with FRS29 and refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Euro borrowings to finance operations The risks identified by FRS29 arising from the Companys financial instruments are other price risk which comprises equity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged from the previous accounting period.
Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Investment Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and balance sheet can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency sterling.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments and loans Movements in rates affecting short term timing differences Movements in rates affecting the income received The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments or other net assets priced in other currencies by the use of derivatives.
However, it has increased finance available to the Company for its investment activities with euro borrowings, thereby hedging part of the movements which are a result of exchange movements.
The Company might also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, financing has been obtained through two euro denominated fixed rate unsecured bank loans, which fall due for repayment on 22 June 2010 and 15 December 2011.
The Company is exposed, therefore, to a fair value interest rate risk if euro interest rates change.
In addition the Company has the facility to draw on a euro 25,000,000 credit facility which expires on 15 December 2011.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities, which can be sold easily to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Details of the Companys borrowing commitments are explained in Notes 11 and 12 on page 43 to the financial statements.
Page 46 Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2008 Notes to the Financial Statements Credit risk Investments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
All security transactions are through brokers which have been approved as an acceptable counterparty.
This is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
At the year end, the exposure to credit risk includes cash at bank and Fidelity Institutional Cash Fund plc and outstanding securities transactions.
Financial Assets The Companys financial assets comprise equity investments, short term debtors and cash.
The currency cash flow profile of these financial assets is shown below.

A 10% weakening of sterling against the euro, Swedish krona and Swiss franc exposures, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
The analysis for 2007 is performed on the same basis.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2008, if interest rates would have increased by 1.0% then the total return on ordinary activities would have increased by 997,000 2007: 1,112,000.
A decrease in the interest rates by 1.0% would have an equal but opposite effect.
The sensitivity is based on the Companys total cash balance held on 31 December 2008, with all other variables held constant.
Other price risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
Details of how the Board sets risk parameters and performance objectives can be found on pages 16 to 19 of the Directors Report.
Other price risk sensitivity analysis An increase of 10% in the fair value of the investments at 31 December 2008 would have increased total return on ordinary activities and total assets by 65,754,000 2007: 84,812,000.
A decrease of 10% in the fair value of investments would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the balance sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
As explained in Note 1 on pages 37 and 38 investments are shown at fair value which is bid market price.
In the case of cash, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
The exceptions are the unsecured term fixed rate loans, whose fair values as at 31 December 2008, given below, have been calculated by discounting future cash flows at current euro interest rates.
