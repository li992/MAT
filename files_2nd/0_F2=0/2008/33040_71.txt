A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2007 Budget statement which have been enacted in the 2007 and 2008 Finance Acts.
The 2007 financial statements were not impacted as the changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The effect of the change has been to reduce the value of the deferred tax liability recognised at 1 April 2007 by 104 million.
This comprises a credit of 154 million which has been recognised in the income statement as a specic item and a charge of 50 million which has been recognised in equity.
The decrease in deferred tax is due to the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
