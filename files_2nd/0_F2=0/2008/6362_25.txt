The group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The company therefore hedges a substantial portion of the groups exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts so as to hedge group translation risk not hedged by way of loans.
Gains and losses on such forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The notional value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2008 was 304.8m 2007: 373.2m.
All these contracts had matured by 28 February 2009.
Following maturity of the forward foreign exchange contracts in February, the contracts were not renewed.
The company is currently assessing its options with regards to hedging this portion of translation risk.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 134.2m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$265m of the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the sterling value on this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at floating rates as described in note e exposes the company to cash flow interest rate risk, which the company manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fix the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum period of five years.
At 31 December 2008 the nominal value of such contracts was 246.9m in respect of US dollar 2007: 213.5m and 271.7m in respect of euro 2007: 183.6m, their weighted average interest rate was 5.0% US dollar 2007: 4.9% and 3.8% euro 2007: 3.8%, and their weighted average period to maturity was two and a half years.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash flow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed rate market, with investors looking for a fixed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the first issue of notes in March 2007, the company was comfortable with the proportion of floating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is Libor 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 was kept at fixed rate.
Counterparty credit risk The companys strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
The total mark to market outstanding with each counterparty is closely monitored.
For short-term transactions under one year, at inception of the transaction the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction the financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of A A1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the companys relationship banks all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2008 the largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were 61.8m and 36.3m and both held with institutions with long term Standard & Poors credit ratings of A.
These exposures represent 40% and 24% of the carrying values of derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
Both of these banks had significant loans outstanding to the company at 31 December 2008.
The company participates in the groups multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an AA rated bank.
There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement.
