During 2008 Bulgarian Land Development Plc restated their 2007 accounts.
The result of this restatement has been reflected in these accounts in 2008.

Henry Klotz, Chief Executive Officer of the Group was appointed as Chairman of Catena in 2007.
The quoted value market value of the Groups investment in the shares of Catena AB at year end was 17,616 thousand 2007: 28,033 thousand.
Bulgarian Land Development Plc During 2007, the Company agreed to subscribe to 7,211,878 shares at a price of 1 per share in Bulgarian Land Development Plc BLD which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange.
BLD develops residential and commercial property opportunities in Bulgaria.
The new subscription increased the Groups stake in BLD to 11,461,787 shares, representing 28.65 per cent of the issued share capital.
In 2008 a further 2,859,500 shares were acquired by the Group to take the total shareholding to 35.8%.
This created negative goodwill of 2,073 thousand which has been released to the income statement in the year and included in the Groups share of loss after tax from associates above.
The quoted value market value of the Groups investment in the shares of Bulgarian Land Development Plc BLD at the year end was 4,583 thousand 2007: 9,055 thousand.
Flavour of the month AB In 2008 the Group acquired a 40% interest in a blog resourcing website, Flavour of the month AB.
Impairment Given the current economic instability and the likelihood of a slowdown in global growth the Group has considered that this represents a potential indication of impairment in relation to its associate investments.
As such the Group has tested the recoverability of its associate investments in accordance with IAS 36, by comparing the carrying amount of the associate investments at the balance sheet date to their recoverable amounts.
This has resulted in a write down of 5,262 thousand to goodwill 2007: Nil In assessing the carrying value of Catena AB, the Group has considered that the balance sheet of Catena AB at 31 December 2008 is stated at fair value except for certain deferred tax liabilities.
It is managements assessment that the realisation of Catenas property assets in the future would occur through corporate disposals and therefore latent deferred tax liabilities are unlikely to crystallise.
Taking this into account the write down in relation to Catena was 3,890k 2007: Nil representing excess of carrying value over fair value.
In assessing the carrying value of Bulgarian Land Development Plc BLD there is significant uncertainty around the timing and level of cash-flows in the future which has crystallised a write down of goodwill of 1,372k 2007: Nil.
A review of BLDs underlying assets has been undertaken which are not impaired at the balance sheet date.
On this basis the Directors consider the Groups share of net assets approximates to recoverable value.
