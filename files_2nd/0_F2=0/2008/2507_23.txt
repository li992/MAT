Job: 10795 British Energy R&A 08 BCK AW Proof: 02 Proof Read by: Operator: Nigel Date: 02.06.2008 Server: studio 3 Set-up: Dave First Read Revisions Parent Company Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2008 1.
Accounting Policies i Basis of Preparation The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
British Energy Group plcs financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom and are therefore being presented separately from the consolidated financial statements of the British Energy Group, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations.
References to the Company are to British Energy Group plc, the ultimate holding company of the British Energy Group.
References to the Group are to the Company and its subsidiaries.
These financial statements cover the financial year from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008, with comparative gures for the financial year from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007.
In preparing the financial statements for the current year, British Energy Group plc has adopted FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures FRS 29.
British Energy Group plc is exempt from the requirements of FRS 29 because the Company is included in British Energy Group plcs publicly available consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008, which include disclosures that comply with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures IFRS 7, the equivalent International Financial Reporting Standard.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results can differ from those estimates.
In accordance with FRS 18 Accounting Policies, the Directors have reviewed British Energy Group plcs accounting policies and con rm that they are the most appropriate.
A number of the policies require British Energy Group plc to use a variety of estimation techniques.
Signi cant factors considered when assessing the carrying value of assets include future electricity prices, expected annual output, expected station operating costs, remaining station lives and discount rates.
British Energy Group plc has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting a pro t and loss account, statement of total recognised gains and losses and cash ow statement.
Accordingly neither a pro t and loss account, statement of total recognised gains and losses, nor a cash ow statement is presented in these financial statements.
ii Fixed Asset Investments Investments in subsidiaries are initially recorded at the cost of shares allotted.
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provisions for diminution in value.
The carrying value of all xed asset investments is regularly assessed for permanent impairment and provision made, if appropriate.
iii Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between taxable pro ts and those stated in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable pro ts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in the pro t and loss account except to the extent that it is attributable to a gain or loss that is or has been recognised directly in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in which case the deferred tax is recognised directly in that statement.
iv Share-based Payment British Energy Group plc has five share compensation schemes, the Share Incentive Plan, the Deferred Incentive Plan, the Long-Term Deferred Bonus Plan, the Executive Share Option Plan 2004 and the Interim Bonus Plan.
British Energy Group plc accounts for its share compensation schemes in accordance with FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
British Energy Group plc issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees of its subsidiaries under the terms of the Companys various employee share compensation schemes.
The fair value of the share compensation schemes is recognised in investments with the corresponding credit included in shareholders equity.

i Called Up Equity Share Capital Called up equity share capital represents the nominal value of shares in issue see note 7.
On 30 May 2007 the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry now the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform announced his intention to direct the NLF to convert and sell part of its interest in British Energy Group plc.
On 1 June 2007 British Energy Group plc received notice from the NLF intimating its intention to convert and sell approximately 400 million shares in the Company, with an over allotment option of a further 50 million shares in the Company.
As a result on 6 June 2007 British Energy Group plc issued 450 million convertible shares of 10p each to the NLF, which were re-designated as 450 million ordinary shares of 10p each and admitted to the Of cial List of the UKLA and to trading on the London Stock Exchange on the same day.
Following the partial conversion and share issue the Cash Sweep Payment percentage was reduced to approximately 36% and resulted in the recognition of an investment in British Energy Bond Finance plc formerly British Energy Holdings plc of 2,340m, additional equity share capital of 45m and additional share premium of 2,295m representing the excess of the conversion share price of 5.20 over the nominal value of shares issued.
The investment in British Energy Bond Finance plc relates to the conversion asset recognised in British Energy Generation Limited and represents the fair value of British Energy Group plcs obligation, which was removed as a result of the exercise of the conversion right.
It should be noted that whilst British Energy Group plc has the commitment to make the Cash Sweep Payment as described in the Contribution Agreement, the Company has agreed with British Energy Generation Limited that British Energy Generation Limited will make the required contribution on behalf of the Company.

Reconciliation of Movement in Shareholders Funds and Movement in Reserves continued ii Share Premium The share premium recorded at 31 March 2008 of 59m 2007: 40m represents the excess of the fair value of Warrants exercised and Warrant proceeds received since Restructuring over the nominal value of the shares issued on exercise.
As a result of the partial conversion by the NLF on 6 June 2007 additional share premium of 2,295m was recognised during the year.
On 22 October 2007 the Court of Session in Edinburgh approved a 2,295m reduction of British Energy Group plcs share premium account, thereby creating distributable reserves of this value.
The reduction of the share premium reserve by 2,295m equates to the amount of new share premium created in relation to the NLF partial conversion.
iii Warrant Reserve On Restructuring the shareholders in British Energy plc were entitled to receive Shares and Warrants in British Energy Group plc.
The Warrants entitle the holder to subscribe for ordinary shares in British Energy Group plc within five years of the Restructuring.
As the Warrants are exercised this reserve will be transferred to share capital and the share premium account.
During the year, 6,955,809 Warrants 2007: 6,399,439 were exercised resulting in an increase of 6,955,809 ordinary shares 2007: 6,399,439, an increase to share premium of 19m 2007: 16m and a reduction in the warrant reserve of 12m 2007: 11m.
The proceeds received in the year in relation to the exercise of the Warrants amounted to 7m 2007: 6m.
Contingent Liabilities British Energy Group plc has given certain indemnities and guarantees in respect of its subsidiary undertakings.
No losses are anticipated to arise under these indemnities and guarantees, provided relevant subsidiary undertakings continue on a going concern basis.
