SHARE BASED PAYMENTS The Company has three equity share-based payment arrangements, namely approved and unapproved share option schemes, an LTIP scheme, and an Employee Share Save Scheme SAYE.
The Group recognised a total expense in the year related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions since 7 November 2002 of 491,000 2007: 336,000.
Equity-settled share option plans The Group granted options to employees under Approved and Unapproved Inland Revenue Share option schemes between 16 November 1999 and 11 November 2003.
The Groups schemes provided for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is three to ten years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Since 3 September 2004 the Group has operated an Employee Share Save Scheme SAYE which allows any employee who has more than six months service to purchase shares at a 20% discount to the average quoted market price of the Group shares at the date of grant.
The associated savings contracts are 3 years at which point the employee can exercise their option to purchase the shares or take the amount saved, including interest, in cash.
The scheme is administered by Yorkshire Building Society.
On 27 September 2004, 6 June 2005, 9 June 2006 and 13 July 2007 the Group awarded nil-paid options to senior management under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The awards are conditional on the achievement of challenging performance targets as described on page 35 of the remuneration report.
The awards granted on 27 September 2004 vested in full.
