Group Financial Statements 13 Earnings per share Earnings per share have been calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue and the losses profits for the financial year.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average numbers of shares used in the calculations are set out below: Based on loss profit attributable to equity holders Loss Number Earnings Profit Number Earnings 1 1 after tax of shares per share after tax of shares per share 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2007 m m p m m p Loss profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 1,067 5,968 17.88 724 6,444 11.24 2 Net shares under options allocable for no further consideration 22 34 0.06 Diluted earnings per share 1,067 5,990 17.88 724 6,478 11.18 The number of shares in issue at 31 December 2008 was 5,861,627,994 2007: 6,296,321,160.
Weighted average number of shares.
Net shares under options allocable for no further consideration are anti-dilutive and have therefore been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.
14 Share-based payments The fair values of the share grants made during the year have been calculated using the following assumptions: SAYE SAYE PSP Award date 10 Apr 08 29 Aug 08 29 Apr 08 Weighted average share price 132p 101p 126p Weighted average exercise price 99p 86p n a Expected volatility 26 33% 27 34% n a Expected life 3 7 years 3 7 years 3 years Risk free investment rate 4.0 4.3% 4.5% n a Dividend yield 4.1% 4.8% n a Expected volatility is a measure of the tendency of a security price to fluctuate in a random, unpredictable manner.
Expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous ten years.
The expected life has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group provides the following equity settled share-based long term incentive plans for directors and eligible employees: Savings related share option scheme SAYE The SAYE allows employees to enter into a regular savings contract over either three, five or seven years, coupled with a corresponding option over shares of the Group.
The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the Group shares on the invitation date.
Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group.

The assumptions used in the model are shown above.
The weighted average fair value of each SAYE option granted during the year was 29p 2007: 45p.
The Group recognised total expenses of 2m 2007: 2m related to the SAYE scheme.
The intrinsic value of vested SAYE options was nil 2007: nil at the year end.
Intrinsic value of a share option is calculated as the current share price less the option price.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2008 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3 years.
com Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 97 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 14 Share-based payments continued Company share option scheme CSOP Executive share option scheme ESOS The CSOP, approved by HMRC, and unapproved ESOS were designed to provide a long term incentive to directors and managers of the Group.
The number of options granted is based on the managers level, salary and performance.
The options have a ten year life but do not normally vest in the first three years.
In order to exercise the options, the Legal & General Total Shareholder Return TSR must exceed the median TSR of the FTSE 100 for a period of at least three years commencing on the date of the grant.

The assumptions used in the model are disclosed on page 97.
No options have been granted since 2004 under these schemes.
The Group recognised total expenses of nil 2007: nil related to the CSOP and ESOS.
The intrinsic value of vested share options at the year end was nil 2007: 4m.
Share bonus plan SBP SBP grants restricted shares which vest with employees three years after the grant date: recipients are entitled to both vote and receive dividends.
The rights associated with SBP grants are normally forfeited on leaving the Group.
The fair value of the shares awarded has been calculated as the market value on the grant date.
During the year, 9,512,807 shares 2007: 6,670,313 shares were awarded under the SBP.
The weighted average fair value of the shares issued was 124p 2007: 155p.
The Group recognised a total expense of 11m 2007: 7m relating to the SBP.
Performance share plan PSP Conditional shares can be granted to top managers under the PSP, based upon individual and Company performance.
Under the PSP, the number of performance shares transferred to the individual at the end of the three year vesting period is dependent on the Groups relative TSR.
The award will vest in full for upper quintile performance.
One quarter of the award will vest for median performance.
Awards will vest on a straight line prorated basis for performance between the median and upper quintile.
For awards made prior to 2008, the performance condition is based upon the FTSE 100.
For awards made during or after 2008, half of each award will be measured using the existing FTSE 100 test, the remaining half is measured against a bespoke group of UK and European insurance companies.
The group comprises all UK-listed life insurers that are constituents of the FTSE 350, plus all members of the insurance sector of the FTSE Eurotop 300.
The two halves are measured independently, thus it is possible that one half may vest, whilst the other does not.
For both comparator groups, the companies used are members of the relevant indices as at the date of award.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee assesses whether the underlying performance of the Company is reflective of the TSR result.
In exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may exercise their discretion to scale back the vesting of awards, if it is felt that the Companys performance did not justify the level of vesting.
The parameters which the Remuneration Committee use in making this assessment include market share, partnerships gained and maintained, cost constraint, capital management and shareholder perception.
During the year, 2,036,380 performance shares 2007: 1,773,775 were awarded.
The weighted average fair value of each award issued was 232p 2007: 306p.
The Group recognised a total expense of 5m 2007: 5m relating to the PSP during the year.
