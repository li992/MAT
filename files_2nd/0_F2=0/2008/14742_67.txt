Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset, including the asset balances analysed the tables above.
The following is an analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: Consolidated Company 2008 2007 2008 2007 m m m m Deferred tax liabilities 967.3 923.7 9.6 27.9 Deferred tax assets 43.1 66.0 Net deferred tax liabilities 924.2 857.7 9.6 27.9 The deferred tax assets disclosed relate to the Groups pension scheme liabilities.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 39.3m 2007 40.6m available for offset against future profits.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 2.1m 2007 2.1m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and jointly controlled entities are recorded as part of the Groups share of investment in those entities.
The aggregate amount of these is a credit of 10.1m 2007 17.5m charge.
