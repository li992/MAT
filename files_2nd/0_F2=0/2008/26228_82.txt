Notes to the Financial Statements continued 49 Assets analysis The Group has categorised its assets and liabilities in the following disclosure in accordance with the level of shareholder exposure to market and credit risks.
The four categorisations presented are: Unit linked For unit linked contracts, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
Unit linked business is written in both the Society LTF and in the LTF of PMC.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders.
The Group is, therefore, not directly exposed to any market risk, currency risk or credit risk for these contracts.
Detailed risk disclosures have not been presented for unit linked assets and liabilities.
With-profits Policyholders and shareholders share in the risks and returns of the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
The return to shareholders on virtually all participating products is in the form of a transfer to shareholders equity, which is analogous to a dividend from the Society LTF and is dependent upon the bonuses credited or declared on policies in that year.
The bonuses are broadly based on historic and current rates of return on equity, property and fixed income securities, as well as expectations of future investment returns.
With-profits also includes participating business in the France operation which shares similar characteristics.
The with-profits classification excludes unit linked contracts.
Non profit non-unit linked Shareholders are exposed to the risk and rewards of ownership of assets backing non profit non-unit linked business held within UK LTFs.
Shareholder All other assets are classified as shareholder.
Shareholders of the Group are directly exposed to market and credit risk on these assets.
This includes the assets and liabilities of our overseas insurance operations.
The table below presents an analysis of the balance sheet by category.
All of the quantitative risk disclosures in Note 50 have been provided using this categorisation.
