Contingent liabilities arising from litigation against the Group are disclosed in Note 42.
Nominal principal amounts represent the amounts at risk should contracts be fully drawn upon and clients default.
The amount of the loan commitments shown above reflects, where relevant, the expected level of take-up of pre-approved loan offers made by mailshots to personal customers.
As a significant portion of guarantees and commitments is expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not representative of future liquidity requirements.
Guarantees HSBC provides guarantees and similar undertakings on behalf of both third-party customers and other entities within the HSBC Group.

2 Standby letters of credit which are financial guarantee contracts are irrevocable obligations on the part of HSBC to pay third parties when customers fail to make payments when due.
3 Other direct credit substitutes include re-insurance letters of credit and trade-related letters of credit issued without provision for the issuing entity to retain title to the underlying shipment.
4 Performance bonds, bid bonds, standby letters of credit and other transaction-related guarantees are undertakings by which the obligation on HSBC to make payment depends on the outcome of a future event.

The risks and exposures arising from guarantees are captured and managed in accordance with HSBCs overall credit risk management policies and procedures.
Approximately half of the above guarantees have a term of less than one year.
Guarantees with terms of more than one year are subject to HSBCs annual credit review process.
Financial Services Compensation Scheme The UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS has provided compensation to consumers following the collapse of a number of deposit takers such as Bradford & Bingley plc, Heritable Bank plc, Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander Limited, Landsbanki Icesave and London Scottish Bank plc.
The compensation paid out to consumers is currently funded through loans from the Bank of England and HM Treasury.
HSBC Bank plc the bank could be liable to pay a proportion of the outstanding borrowings that the FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury which at 16 December 2008 stood at 19.7 billion US$28.7 billion.
The bank is also obligated to pay its share of forecast management expenses based on the banks market share of deposits protected under the FSCS.
The bank has provided 86 million US$125.4 million as at 31 December 2008 in respect of the share of forecast management expense, including interest costs, for the 2008 9 and 2009 10 levy years.
This accrual is based on the banks estimated share of total market protected deposits at 31 December 2007 and 2008, respectively.
However, the ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of the 2008 collapses cannot currently be estimated reliably as it is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS and changes in the interest rate, the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members at the time.
Commitments In addition to the commitments disclosed on page 440, at 31 December 2008, HSBC had US$1,541 million 2007: US$942 million of capital commitments contracted but not provided for and US$267 million 2007: US$194 million of capital commitments authorised but not contracted for.
