JPMorgan Emerging Markets Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 33 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 30th June 2008 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the AIC in December 2005.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments and derivative financial instruments at fair value.
The Company has adopted FRS 29: Financial Instruments: Disclosures for the first time in these accounts.
FRS 29 introduces new disclosure requirements relating to financial instruments.
This standard does not have any impact on the classification and or valuation of the Companys financial instruments.
The disclosures required by this standard are given in notes 22 and 23 on pages 42 to 47. b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off in the capital column of the income statement at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value which is bid market price for listed investments.
Unquoted and restricted investments are valued at fair value by the Board.
In making its valuations, the Board has taken into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, assets values and other relevant factors.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains or losses on disposal are included in the capital column of the income statement within Gains from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Expenses incidental to the purchase and sale of investments are also included within this caption.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is taken to capital.
UK dividends are accounted for net of any tax credits.
Overseas dividends are shown gross of withholding tax.
Interest receivable from debt securities together with any premiums or discounts on purchase are allocated to revenue on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate of those securities.
Stock lending income and interest receivable on deposits is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Special dividends are recognised on an ex-dividend basis and are treated as a capital item or an income item depending on the facts and circumstances of each dividend.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue with the following exceptions: performance related fees are allocated 100% to capital: expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are included within the cost of the investment and those incidental to the sale are deducted from the sales proceeds.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and include items such as stamp duty and broker commissions.
In accordance with the SORP, disclosure of transaction costs is now required and can be found in note 11.
34 JPMorgan Emerging Markets Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Accounts continued e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated wholly to revenue.
f Financial instruments Cash at bank and in hand may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments are valued at fair value and are included in current assets or current liabilities in the balance sheet in accordance with FRS 26: Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Short term forward currency contracts are classified as derivative financial instruments and the net unrealised gain or loss is included in debtors or creditors respectively.
This represents a change in accounting policy from the prior year where the amount receivable under these contracts and the amount payable was included separately in debtors and creditors respectively.
The prior year accounts have been restated, however, this adjustment has no effect on the net assets of the Company.
g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, have determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising on monetary assets from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
Gains and losses on investments arising from a change in exchange rates are included in gains from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
h Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
i Dividends In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are paid.
j VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
The basis on which it has been calculated is the partial exemption method using the proportion of taxable supplies to non taxable supplies.
Further information regarding VAT on management fees is given in note 6 on page 36.

VAT recoverable In November 2007, HM Revenue & Customs announced that it had withdrawn its appeal in the case, brought jointly by the AIC and JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust plc, challenging the imposition of VAT on management fees paid by investment trust companies.
The Company ceased paying VAT on management fees with effect from 1st October 2007 and is entitled to seek reimbursement of VAT paid in the past.
The VAT stated as recoverable represents VAT which is expected to be recovered from the Manager with sufficient certainty in respect of most years from the Company's launch in 1991 to 30th September 2007.
The Board is satisfied with the legal advice that it has received on this matter.
The amounts will not be actually received by the Company from the Manager until HM Revenue & Customs refunds certain amounts to the Manager.
The VAT expected to be recoverable has been allocated between income and capital in the proportions in which it was expensed to income and capital in each relevant period when it was paid by the Company.

This has arisen because deductible expenses have exceeded taxable income.
This asset may be utilised in future years where there is an excess of taxable income over deductible expenses.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust company, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on page 16.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close co-operation with the Board and the Manager, co-ordinates the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise the following: investments in equity shares of overseas companies and a US Dollar liquidity fund which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: and short term forward currency contracts for the purpose of settling short term liabilities.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analysis where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least five occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.
It is currently not the Companys policy to hedge against foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure as at 30th June are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of profit after taxation for the year and equity with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and assumes a 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the US Dollar, South Korean Won, South African Rand, Indian Rupee, New Taiwan Dollar and other currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is deemed reasonable based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened this would have had the following effect: 2008 2007 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 934 788 Capital return 2,370 84 Total return after taxation for the year 3,304 872 Net assets 3,304 872 44 J JPMor PMorgan Emer gan Emergin ging Markets Inv g Markets Investment estment T Trust plc rust plc Annual R Annual Repor eport & Accounts 2008 t & Accounts 2008 Notes to the Accounts continued Conversely if sterling had strengthened this would have had the following effect: 2008 2007 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 934 788 Capital return 2,370 84 Total return after taxation for the year 3,304 872 Net assets 3,304 872 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is not representative of the whole of the current year.
However the analysis is broadly representative of the whole of the comparative year.
ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and investments in liquidity funds.
Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings are used when required.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below.
2008 2007 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and short term deposits 7 925 JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund 23,793 Total exposure 23,800 925 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin over LIBOR.
The target interest rate earned on the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund is the 7 day US Dollar London Interbank Bid Rate.
The exposure to floating interest rates has fluctuated during the year between net overdraft balances and net cash and liquidity fund balances as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Maximum interest rate exposure to floating rates net overdraft balances 5,134 1,530 Minimum interest rate exposure to floating rates net cash and liquidity fund balances 26,372 7,183 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the revenue after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least five occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys exposure to changes in market prices at 30th June comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2008 2007 000 000 Equity investments at fair value through profit or loss 494,019 511,914 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 13 and 14.
This shows that the investments value is in a broad spread of countries with no concentration of exposure to any one country.
It should also be noted that an investments country of domicile does not necessarily equate to the economic conditions in that country.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% in the fair value of the Companys equities in sterling terms.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and adjusting for change in the management fee, but with all other variables held constant.

Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and to maximise capital return to shareholders.
The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: the need for issues of new shares, including issues from Treasury: and the ability to employ gearing when the Manager believes it to be appropriate.
