Financial statements MCEV 286 324 Aviva plc 295 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Notes to the MCEV financial statements Financial statements MCEV Other information M1 Basis of preparation Introduction The summarised consolidated income statement and balance sheet on pages 289 to 291 present the Groups results and financial position for the life and related businesses on the Market Consistent Embedded Value MCEV basis and for its non-life businesses on the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS basis.
The MCEV methodology adopted is in accordance with the MCEV Principles published by the CFO Forum in June 2008 with the exception of the use of an adjusted risk-free yield due to current market conditions for immediate annuities in the UK and Netherlands and for immediate annuities, deferred annuities and all other contracts in the US.
The CFO Forum MCEV Principles were designed during a period of relatively stable market conditions.
As announced on 19 December 2008, the CFO Forum has agreed to conduct a review of the impact of turbulent market conditions on the MCEV Principles, the result of which may lead to changes to the published MCEV Principles or the issuance of guidance.
The particular areas under review include implied volatilities, the cost of non-hedgeable risks, the use of swap rates as a proxy for risk-free rates and the effect of liquidity premia.
The directors consider that Avivas MCEV methodology gives useful insight into the drivers of financial performance of the groups life and related businesses.
This basis values future cash flows from assets consistently with market prices, including more explicit allowance for the impact of uncertainty in future investment returns and other risks.
Embedded value is also consistent with the way pricing is assessed and the business is managed.
The results for 2008 and 2007 have been audited by our auditors, Ernst & Young.
Their report in respect of 2008 can be found on page 288 in the Report and Accounts.
Covered business The MCEV calculations cover the following lines of business: life insurance, long-term health and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business written by our life insurance subsidiaries, including managed pension fund business and our share of the other life and related business written in our associated undertakings and joint ventures, as well as the equity release business written in the UK.
Covered business includes the Groups share of our joint ventures including our arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group RBSG and our associated undertakings in India, China, Turkey, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea.
In addition, the results of group companies providing significant administration, fund management and other services and of group holding companies have been included to the extent that they relate to covered business.
Together these businesses are referred to as Life and related businesses.
Adjusted risk-free rate Avivas MCEV methodology adopts the CFO Forum Principles and Guidance with the exception of the use of an adjusted risk-free yield due to current market conditions for UK and Netherlands immediate annuities and for immediate annuities, deferred annuities and all other contracts in the US.
In stable markets, swap curves are an appropriate risk-free rate.
However, in the current turbulent market it is possible, for products where backing asset portfolios can be held to maturity, to earn returns in excess of swaps by investing in corporate bonds and credit default swaps CDS.
The reference rate for these products has been increased above the swap curve to estimate the additional returns available through replicating portfolios where backing assets can be held to maturity in the current market.
Due to the limited availability of CDS assets, particularly at the long durations, this is a material area of judgement and sensitivity analysis has been provided on page 320 on the additions to the swap curves.
In current markets, adjustments have been made to the swap rate for UK and Netherlands immediate annuities and all US contracts.
Details of adjustments can be found in note M14.
Aviva plc 296 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the MCEV financial statements M1 Basis of preparation continued New business premiums New business premiums include: premiums arising from the sale of new contracts during the period: non-contractual additional premiums, including future Department of Work and Pensions DWP rebate premiums: and expected renewals on new contracts and expected future contractual alterations to new contracts.
The Groups definition of new business under MCEV includes contracts that meet the definition of non-participating investment contracts under IFRS.
For products sold to individuals, premiums are considered to represent new business where a new contract has been signed, or where underwriting has been performed.
Renewal premiums include contractual renewals, noncontractual variations that are reasonably predictable and recurrent single premiums that are pre-defined and reasonably predictable.
For Group products, new business includes new contracts and increases to aggregate premiums under existing contracts.
Renewal premiums are based on the level of premium received during the reporting period and allow for premiums expected to be received beyond the expiry of any guaranteed premium rates.
Life and pensions operating earnings For life and pensions operating earnings, Aviva uses normalised investment returns, which are generally expressed as one year swap returns plus an asset risk premium.
The use of asset risk premiums reflects managements long-term expectations of asset returns in excess of the swap yield from investing in different asset classes.
This assumption does not impact the embedded value as asset risk premia are not recognised until earned.
MCEV methodology Overview Under the MCEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of products defined within covered business.
The total profit recognised over the lifetime of a policy is the same as under the IFRS basis of reporting, but the timing of recognition is different.
Calculation of the embedded value The shareholders interest in the life and related businesses is represented by the embedded value.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life and related businesses and the value of in-force covered business.
Calculations are performed separately for each business and are based on the cash flows of that business, after allowing for both external and intra-group reinsurance.
Where one life business has an interest in another, the net worth of that business excludes the interest in the dependent company.
The embedded value is calculated on an after-tax basis applying current legislation and practice together with future known changes.
Where gross results are presented, these have been calculated by grossing up post-tax results at the full rate of corporation tax for each country based on opening period tax rates.
Net worth The net worth is the market value of the shareholders funds and the shareholders interest in the surplus held in the non-profit component of the long-term business funds, determined on a statutory solvency basis and adjusted to add back any non-admissible assets, and consists of the required capital and free surplus.
Required capital is the market value of assets attributed to the covered business over and above that required to back liabilities for covered business, for which distribution to shareholders is restricted.
Required capital is reported net of implicit items permitted on a local regulatory basis to cover minimum solvency margins which are assessed at a local entity level.
The level of required capital for each business unit is set equal to the higher of: The level of capital at which the local regulator is empowered to take action: The capital requirement of the business unit under the Groups economic capital requirements: and, The target capital level of the business unit.
This methodology reflects the level of capital considered by the directors to be appropriate to manage the business.
The same definition of required capital is used for both existing and new business.
The free surplus is the market value of any assets allocated to, but not required to support, the in-force covered business at the valuation date.
The level of required capital across the business units expressed as a percentage of the EU minimum solvency margin or equivalent can be found on page 316.
Financial statements MCEV 286 324 Aviva plc 297 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information M1 Basis of preparation continued Value of in-force covered business VIF The value of in-force covered business consists of the following components: present value of future profits: time value of financial options and guarantees: frictional costs of required capital: and, cost of residual non-hedgeable risks.
Present value of future profits PVFP This is the present value of the distributable profits to shareholders arising from the in-force covered business projected on a best estimate basis.
Distributable profits generally arise when they are released following actuarial valuations.
These valuations are carried out in accordance with any local statutory requirements designed to ensure and demonstrate solvency in long-term business funds.
Future distributable profits will depend on experience in a number of areas such as investment return, discontinuance rates, mortality, administration costs, as well as management and policyholder actions.
Releases to shareholders arising in future years from the in-force covered business and associated required capital can be projected using assumptions of future experience.
Future profits are projected using best estimate non-economic assumptions and market consistent economic assumptions.
In principle, each cash flow is discounted at a rate that appropriately reflects the riskiness of that cash flow, so higher risk cash flows are discounted at higher rates.
In practice, the PVFP is calculated using the certainty equivalent approach, under which the reference rate is used for both the investment return and the discount rate.
This approach ensures that asset cash flows are valued consistently with the market prices of assets without options and guarantees.
Further information on the risk-free rates is given in note M14.
The PVFP includes the capitalised value of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the extent that they relate to covered business.
This is referred to as the look through into service company expenses.
In addition, expenses arising in holding companies that relate directly to acquiring or maintaining covered business have been allowed for.
Where external companies provide services to the life and related businesses, their charges have been allowed for in the underlying projected cost base.
Time value of financial options and guarantees TVOG The PVFP calculation is based on a single base economic scenario.
However, a single scenario cannot appropriately allow for the effect of certain product features.
If an option or guarantee affects shareholder cash flows in the base scenario, the impact is included in the PVFP and is referred to as the intrinsic value of the option guarantee.
However, future investment returns are uncertain and the actual impact on shareholder profits may be higher or lower.
The value of in-force business needs to be adjusted for the impact of the range of potential future outcomes.
Stochastic modelling techniques can be used to assess the impact of potential future outcomes, and the difference between the intrinsic value and the total stochastic value is referred to as the time value of the option or guarantee.
Stochastic modelling typically involves projecting the future cash flows of the business under thousands of economic scenarios that are representative of the possible future outcomes for market variables such as interest rates and equity returns.
Under a market consistent approach, the economic scenarios generated reflect the markets tendency towards risk aversion.
Allowance is made, where appropriate, for the effect of management and or policyholder actions in different economic conditions on future assumptions such as asset mix, bonus rates and surrender rates.
Stochastic models are calibrated to market yield curves and volatility levels at the valuation date.
Tests are performed to confirm that the scenarios used produce results that replicate the market price of traded instruments.
Where evidence exists that persistency rates are linked to economic scenarios, dynamic lapse assumptions are set that vary depending on the individual scenarios.
This cost is included in the TVOG.
Dynamic lapses are modelled for parts of the US and French business.
Asymmetries in non-economic assumptions that are linked to economic scenarios, but that have insufficient evidence for credible dynamic assumptions, are allowed for within mean best estimate assumptions.
Aviva plc 298 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the MCEV financial statements continued M1 Basis of preparation continued Frictional costs of required capital The additional costs to a shareholder of holding the assets backing required capital within an insurance company rather than directly in the market are called frictional costs.
They are explicitly deducted from the PVFP.
The additional costs allowed for are the taxation costs and any additional investment expenses on the assets backing the required capital.
The level of required capital has been set out above in the net worth section.
Frictional costs are calculated by projecting forwards the future levels of required capital.
Tax on investment return and investment expenses are payable on the assets backing required capital up until the point that they are released to shareholders.
Cost of residual non-hedgeable risks CNHR The cost of residual non-hedgeable risks CNHR covers risks not already allowed for in the time value of options and guarantees or the PVFP.
The allowance includes the impact of both non-hedgeable financial and non-financial risks.
The most significant risk not included in the PVFP or TVOG is operational risk.
Avivas methodology includes a cost of non-hedgeable risk equivalent to a charge of 2.5% applied to groupdiversified capital.
The cost has been calculated as a 1.5% charge applied to business unit-level capital, that is, allowing for diversification within a business unit, but not between business units.
The charge was set so as to give an aggregate allowance that was in excess of the expected operational risk costs arising from the in-force covered business over its remaining lifetime.
The capital levels used are projected to be sufficient to cover non-hedgeable risks at the 99.5% confidence level one-year after the valuation date.
The capital is equal to the capital from the ICA results for those risks considered.
The capital has been projected as running off over the remaining life of the in-force portfolio in line with the drivers of the capital requirement.
In addition to the operational risk allowance, financial non-hedgeable risks and other product level asymmetries have been allowed for.
These allowances are not material as significant financial non-hedgeable risks and product level asymmetries are either modelled explicitly and included in the TVOG or are included in the PVFP through the use of appropriate best estimate assumptions.
Asymmetric risks allowed for in the TVOG or PVFP are described earlier in the Basis of Preparation.
No allowance has been made within the cost of non-hedgeable risk for symmetrical risks as these are diversifiable by investors.
Participating business Future regular bonuses on participating business are projected in a manner consistent with current bonus rates and expected future market-consistent returns on assets deemed to back the policies.
For with-profit funds in the UK and Ireland, for the purpose of recognising the value of the estate, it is assumed that terminal bonuses are increased to exhaust all of the assets in the fund over the future lifetime of the in-force with-profit policies.
However, under stochastic modelling there may be some extreme economic scenarios when the total assets in the Groups with-profit funds are not sufficient to pay all policyholder claims.
The average additional shareholder cost arising from this shortfall has been included in the TVOG.
For profit sharing business in continental Europe, where policy benefits and shareholder value depend on the timing of realising gains, the apportionment of unrealised gains between policyholders and shareholders reflect contractual requirements as well as existing practice.
Under certain economic scenarios where additional shareholder injections are required to meet policyholder payments, the average additional cost has been included in the TVOG.
The embedded value of the US spread-based products anticipates the application of management discretion allowed for contractually within the policies, subject to contractual guarantees.
This includes the ability to change the crediting rates and indexed strategies available within the policy.
Consideration is taken of the economic environment assumed in future projections and returns in excess of the reference rate are not assumed.
Anticipated market and policyholder reaction to management action has been considered.
The anticipated management action is consistent with current decision rules and has been approved and signed off by management and legal counsel.
Financial statements MCEV 286 324 Aviva plc 299 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information M1 Basis of preparation continued Consolidation adjustments The effect of transactions between group life companies such as loans and reinsurance arrangements have been included in the results split by territory in a consistent manner.
No elimination is required on consolidation.
As the MCEV methodology incorporates the impact of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the Groups life companies, the equivalent profits and losses have been removed from the relevant segment non-insurance or fund management and are instead included within the results of life and related businesses.
In addition, the underlying basis of calculation for these profits has changed from the IFRS basis to the MCEV basis.
The capitalised value of the future profits and losses from such service companies are included in the embedded value and value of new business calculations for the relevant business, but the net assets representing historical profits and other amounts remain under non-insurance or fund management.
In order to reconcile the profits arising in the financial period within each segment with the assets on the opening and closing balance sheets, a transfer of IFRS profits from life and related business to the appropriate segment is deemed to occur.
An equivalent approach has been adopted for expenses within our holding companies.
The assessments of goodwill, intangibles and pension schemes relating to life insurance business utilise the IFRS measurement basis.
Prior year comparatives The prior year comparatives have been restated to MCEV as announced on 4 February 2009.
Presentation changes Please refer to note 2 of the IFRS section of the Report and Accounts.
Exchange rates The Groups principal overseas operations during the period were located within the Eurozone and the United States.
The results and cash flows of these operations have been translated at the average rates for that period and the assets and liabilities have been translated at the period end rates as follows: 2008 2007 Eurozone Average rate 1 equals 0.80 0.68 Period end rate 1 equals 0.97 0.73 United States Average rate US$1 equals 0.54 0.50 Period end rate US$1 equals 0.69 0.50 Aviva plc 300 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the MCEV financial statements continued M2 Analysis of life and pension earnings The following table provides an analysis of the movement in embedded value for the covered business.
The analysis is shown separately for free surplus, required capital and the value of in-force covered business, and includes amounts transferred between these categories.
Included within capital and dividend flows is the transfer to life and related businesses from other segments consisting of service company profits and losses during the reported period that have emerged from the value of in-force.
Since the look through into service companies includes only future profits and losses, these amounts must be eliminated from the closing embedded value.
All figures are shown net of tax and minority interests.
Required capital is shown net of implicit items permitted by local regulators to cover minimum solvency margins.
Financial statements MCEV 286 324 Aviva plc 301 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information M3 Life MCEV operating return The components of the life MCEV earnings in the consolidated income statement have been further analysed in this note.
This analysis shows the life MCEV earnings gross of both taxes and minorities analysed in total.
In this table the life and pensions MCEV earnings have been broken down into constituent parts.
The life and pensions MCEV operating earnings comprise: the value of new business written during the year: the earnings from existing business: and, the expected investment return on the shareholders net worth.
These components are calculated using economic assumptions as at the start of the year in-force business or start of the quarter new business and operating demographic and expenses assumptions as at the end of the year.
Restated 2008 2007 Life and pensions MCEV earnings m m Value of new business 780 897 Earnings from existing business expected returns at the reference rate 992 877 expected returns in excess of the reference rate 446 420 expected returns 1,438 1,297 experience variances 224 111 operating assumption changes 165 25 other operating variances 271 1 Expected return on shareholders net worth 701 485 Life and pensions operating earnings before tax 2,801 2,544 Economic variances 12,422 19 Other non-operating variances 329 Life and pensions loss earnings before tax 9,950 2,525 Tax on operating earnings 821 754 Tax on other activities 3,779 48 Life and pensions loss earnings after tax 6,992 1,819 There were no separate development costs reported in these years.
The table above presents a summarised breakdown of the life and pensions MCEV earnings on a gross of minorities basis and gross of tax with tax shown separately.
The Group favours the gross presentation for consistency with the IFRS results.
The table below compares the key items on the different bases as the subsequent analysis is provided predominantly on a net of tax and minorities basis as preferred by the CFO Forum Principles.

The tables below set out the present value of new business premiums PVNBP, written by the life and related businesses, the value of new business and the resulting margin firstly gross and then net of tax and minority interests.
The PVNBP calculation is equal to total single premium sales received in the period plus the discounted value of regular premiums expected to be received over the term of the new contracts, and is expressed at the point of sale.
New business sales are expressed as the PVNBP.
The premium volumes and projection assumptions used to calculate the present value of regular premiums for each product are the same as those used to calculate the value of new business, so the components of the new business margin are on a consistent basis.
The value generated by new business written during the period is the present value of the projected stream of after tax distributable profit from that business.
The value of new business has been calculated using economic assumptions at the point of sale which has been implemented with the assumptions being taken as those appropriate to the start of each quarter.
For contracts that are re-priced more frequently, weekly or monthly economic assumptions have been used.
The operating assumptions are consistent with those used to determine the embedded value.
The value of new business is shown after the effect of the frictional costs of holding required capital, and after the effect of the costs of residual non-hedgeable risks on the same basis as for the in-force covered business.
The internal rate of return IRR is a measure of the shareholder return expected on this capital investment.
It is equivalent to the discount rate at which the present value of the post-tax cash flows expected to be earned over the life time of the business written, including allowance for the time value of options and guarantees, is equal to the total invested capital to support the writing of the business.
The capital included in the calculation of the IRR is the initial capital required to pay acquisition costs and set up statutory reserves in excess of premiums received initial capital, plus required capital at the same level as for the calculation of the value of new business.
The payback period shows how quickly shareholders can expect the total capital to be repaid.
The payback period has been calculated based on undiscounted cash flows and allows for the initial and required capital.
Aviva plc 304 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the MCEV financial statements continued M4 New business continued The projected investment returns in both the IRR and payback period calculations assume that equities, properties and bonds earn a return in excess of risk-free consistent with the long-term rate of return assumed in operating earnings.
In the Netherlands, the value of new business is low on a real world basis, and so it is not possible to calculate a meaningful payback period.
Consequently, the total and Europe average payback periods exclude the Netherlands.
On a comparable basis the total payback period in 2007 is 7 years.

Hence, it is higher than the impact of writing that new business on net worth of 758 million 2007 restated: 624 million shown on page 298, because the latter amount includes expected profits from the point of sale to the end of the reporting period, partly offset by the cost of holding the initial capital.
The fall in IRR reflects the reduction on reference rates and the higher weighting of the Netherlands.

The cashflows projected are the expected future cashflows including expected investment cashflows from equities, bond and properties earning a risk premium in excess of risk free, statutory reserves and required capital.
The risk premiums used are consistent with those used in the expected existing business contribution within operating earnings.
As the risk premiums are positive, a discount rate higher than risk-free is required to give a value equal to the marketconsistent embedded value.
Average derived risk discount rates are shown below for the embedded value.
Where the value of in force business is negative, an IDR can not be calculated.
Consequently an average total IDR is not meaningful.

Financial statements MCEV 286 324 Aviva plc 315 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information M14 Principal economic assumptions a Economic assumptions Deterministic calculations Economic assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each reporting period.
In setting the risk-free rate we have, wherever possible used the mid-price swap yield curve for an AA-rated bank.
The curve is extrapolated if necessary to get rates suitable to the liabilities.
For markets in which there is no reliable swap yield curve the relevant government bond yields are used.
Required capital is shown as a multiple of the EU statutory minimum solvency margin or equivalent.
The adjustments made to swap rates to derive a risk-free rate for UK and Netherlands immediate annuities and immediate annuities, deferred annuities and all other US business are shown below the reference rate table.
The principal economic assumptions used are as follows: Reference rate and expense inflation Eurozone excluding United Kingdom the Netherlands 2008 2007 2008 2007 Reference rate term 1 year 2.8% 5.7% 2.5% 4.8% Reference rate term 5 years 3.2% 5.1% 3.3% 4.6% Reference rate term 10 years 3.5% 5.0% 3.8% 4.7% Reference rate term 15 years 3.8% 4.9% 3.9% 4.9% Reference rate term 20 years 3.8% 4.8% 3.9% 4.9% Expense inflation 3.5% 3.6% 2.1% 2.9% 1 Netherlands Poland 2008 2007 2008 2007 Reference rate term 1 year 2.5% 4.7% 4.4% 6.2% Reference rate term 5 years 3.3% 4.6% 4.3% 5.8% Reference rate term 10 years 3.8% 4.7% 4.2% 5.5% Reference rate term 15 years 4.0% 4.9% 4.1% 5.4% Reference rate term 20 years 3.9% 5.0% 4.0% 5.4% Expense inflation 2.5% 3.0% 2.9% 4.7% United States 2008 2007 Reference rate term 1 year 1.3% 4.2% Reference rate term 5 years 2.2% 4.2% Reference rate term 10 years 2.6% 4.7% Reference rate term 15 years 2.9% 4.9% Reference rate term 20 years 2.9% 5.0% Expense inflation 3.0% 3.5% 1.
The economic assumptions used in the Netherlands differ from those in the Eurozone as the Dutch bank swap rate is used in the Netherlands.
For service companies, expense inflation relates to the underlying expenses rather than the fees charged to the life company.
In current markets, the following adjustments are made to the swap rate for UK and Netherlands immediate annuities and all US contracts.
The risk-free rate is taken as the swap yield curve for the currency of the liability, adjusted by: New business Embedded value Fourth Third Quarter First half Second half Quarter 2008 2008 2008 2007 2008 2007 UK and Netherlands immediate annuities 1.45% 0.85% 0.55% 0.25% 1.50% 0.50% US immediate annuities 2.00% 0.65% 0.55% 0.25% 3.00% 0.50% US deferred annuities and other contracts 1.50% 0.65% 0.55% 0.25% 2.50% 0.50% Aviva plc 316 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Notes to the MCEV financial statements continued M14 Principal economic assumptions continued Risk premium used for operating profit, Implied Discount Rates IDR, Internal Rates of Return IRR and payback period For life and pensions operating earnings, Aviva uses normalised investment returns, which are generally expressed as one year swap returns plus an asset risk premium.
The use of asset risk premia only impacts operating earnings as expected returns reflect managements long-term expectations of asset returns in excess of the reference rate from investing in different asset classes.
This assumption does not impact the balance sheet embedded value or value of new business as asset risk premia are not recognised until earned.
The asset risk premia set out in the table below are added to the 1 year reference rate to calculate expected returns.
All territories 2008 2007 Equity risk premium 3.5% 3.5% Property risk premium 2.0% 2.0% Future returns on corporate fixed interest investments are calculated from prospective yields less an adjustment for credit risk.
The required capital in the United Kingdom under MCEV is 100% for unit-linked and other non-participating business and 110% for annuity business 2.
Required capital in Italy under MCEV is 184% of the EU minimum for Eurovita and 115% for other companies 3.
Required capital in the Netherlands is 168%.
This capital level is the aggregate capital required for the Netherlands.
Required capital in Spain is 125% of the EU minimum for Aviva Vida y Pensiones and 110% for bancassurance companies.
Correct tax legislation and rates have been assumed to continue unaltered except where changes in future tax rates have been announced.
Other economic assumptions Required capital relating to with-profit business is assumed to be covered by the surplus within the with-profit funds and no effect has been attributed to shareholders.
Bonus rates on participating business have been set at levels consistent with the economic assumptions.
The distribution of profit between policyholders and shareholders within the with-profit funds assumes that the shareholder interest in conventional with-profit business in the United Kingdom and Ireland continues at the current rate of one-ninth of the cost of bonus.
b Economic Assumptions Stochastic calculations The calculation of time value of options and guarantees allows for expected management and policyholder actions in response to varying future investment conditions.
The management actions modelled include changes to asset mix, bonus rates and rates of interest and other guarantees granted to policyholders.
Modelled policyholder actions are described under Other assumptions.
The embedded value of the US spread based products anticipates the application of management discretion allowed for contractually within the policies, subject to contractual guarantees.
Model United Kingdom, Europe excluding Delta Lloyd and North America Swap rates are generated by a model, the Libor Market Model LMM, that projects a full swap curve at monthly intervals.
Forward rates are assumed to have a log-normal distribution which guarantees non-negative interest rates.
The model is calibrated to at-the-money swaptions of a variety of terms and tenors.
Swaption volatilities are taken from Bloomberg.
Tests have been performed to ensure that sufficient scenarios have been used that the result converges to the stochastic value of the business being valued.
Financial statements MCEV 286 324 Aviva plc 317 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information M14 Principal economic assumptions continued The total annual return on equities is calculated as the return on one-year swaps plus an excess return.
This excess return is modelled using a log-normal model where volatility varies by time horizon.
This allows the model to capture the term structure of implied volatilities.
The model is calibrated to at-the-money options of a variety of terms.
Option volatilities are taken from a survey of investment banks.
The model also generates property total returns and real yield curves, although these are not significant asset classes for Aviva outside the UK.
In the absence of liquid market data, the volatilities of these asset classes are based on historic data.
Assumptions for correlations between asset classes have been set based on historic data.
Model Netherlands In the Netherlands, yield curves are based on fide Nederlandsche Bank DNB yield curve data.
The interest rate model used is a short rate G2 model.
The model is calibrated to the DNB yield curve and the swaption implied volatilities.
Swaption implied volatilities are taken from Bloomberg.
The equity model is a Heston model.
The model considers an equity volatility surface in the market and covers strike levels between 0.8 and 1.2.
The model is calibrated to the same DNB curves used in interest rate model.
The option volatilities used for year-end 2007 are DJ Eurostoxx 50-quotes taken from Bloomberg.
For 2008 the model was calibrated to DJ Eurostoxx 50-quotes end of August 2008 provided by a market maker.
The inflation model used is based on the standard Jarrow-Yildirim inflation model which connects real and nominal yields and an inflation index.
This is calibrated to ZCII quotes on HICPxT-index.
Asset classes The significant asset classes for UK participating business are equities, property and long-term fixed rate bonds.
The most significant assumption is the distribution of future long-term interest rates, since this is the most important factor in the cost of guaranteed annuity options.
For many businesses, including US, France and Netherlands, the most important assets are fixed rate bonds of various durations.
Summary statistics Swaption implied volatilities The implied volatility is that determined by Black's formula to reproduce the market price of the option.
The following table sets out the model swaption implied volatilities.
Volatilities are calibrated to end August 2008.

The following tables sets out the model equity implied volatilities.
Property implied volatilities Best estimate levels of volatility have been used, in the absence of meaningful option prices from which implied levels of volatility can be derived.
For the UK and the Netherlands, model property implied volatility is 15% for 31 December 2008 31 December 2007:15%.
Demographic assumptions Assumed future mortality, morbidity and lapse rates have been derived from an analysis of Avivas recent operating experience with a view to giving a best estimate of future experience.
We have anticipated future changes in experience where that is appropriate, e. g. we have allowed for improvements in future policyholder longevity.
We have set the assumptions based on a best estimate of outcome of shareholder outcomes.
In particular, where the policyholder behaviour varies with economic experience, we have set assumptions which are dynamic, i. e. vary depending on the economic assumptions.
For example, surrender and option take up rate assumptions that vary according to the investment scenario under consideration have been used in the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees, based on our assessment of likely policyholder behaviour in different investment scenarios.
Additionally, where demographic experience is not driven by economic scenarios but is asymmetric on a stand-alone basis, the best estimate assumption considers the weighted-average expected experience, not simply the median or most likely outcome.
Expense assumptions Management expenses and operating expenses of holding companies attributed to life and related businesses have been included in the MCEV calculations and split between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business, the maintenance of business in-force and project expenses.
Future expense assumptions include an allowance for maintenance expenses and a proportion of recurring project expenses.
Certain expenses of an exceptional nature, when they occur, are identified separately and are generally charged as incurred.
No future productivity gains have been anticipated.
Where subsidiary companies provide administration, investment management or other services to our life businesses, the value of profits or losses arising from these services have been included in the embedded value and value of new business.
Non-hedgeable risk A charge of 2.5% has been applied to the Group-diversified capital required on a 1-in-200 one-year basis over the remaining lifetime of in-force business.

M15 Sensitivity analysis In this note the sensitivity of both our embedded value and value of new business is presented.
There are sensitivities to the economic assumptions used and the non-economic assumptions.
a Economic assumptions The following tables show the sensitivity of the embedded value and the value of new business to: Using swap yields as the risk-free rate.
one and two percentage point increase and decrease in the risk-free rate, including all consequential changes including assumed investment returns for all asset classes, market values of fixed interest assets, risk discount rates : 10% increase and decrease in market values of equity and property assets: 25% increase in equity and swaption volatilities: 50 basis point increase and decrease in credit spreads: and decrease in the level of required capital to 100% EU minimum or equivalent.
In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised economic conditions.
For example, future bonus rates are automatically adjusted to reflect sensitivity changes to future investment returns.
Some of the sensitivity scenarios may have consequential effects on valuation bases, where the basis for certain blocks of business is actively updated to reflect current economic circumstances.
Consequential valuation impacts on the sensitivities are allowed for where an active valuation basis is used.
Where businesses have a target asset mix, the portfolio is re-balanced after a significant market movement otherwise no re-balancing is assumed.
For new business, the sensitivities reflect the impact of a change immediately after inception of the policy.
In general, the magnitude of the sensitivities will reflect the size of the embedded values, though this will vary as the sensitivities have different impacts on the different components of the embedded value.
In addition, other factors can have a material impact, such as the nature of the options and guarantees, as well as the types of investments held.
Sensitivities will also vary according to the current economic assumptions, mainly due to the impact of changes to both the intrinsic cost and time value of options and guarantees.
Options and guarantees are the main reason for the asymmetry of the sensitivities where the guarantee impacts to different extents under the different scenarios.
This can be seen in the sensitivity of a 1%2% movement in the interest rate for the Netherlands and US, where there is a significant amount of business with investment return guarantees.

Where there is a look through into service company expenses the fee charged by the service company is unchanged while the underlying expense decreases: 10% decrease in lapse rates a 10% sensitivity on a base assumption of 5% pa would represent a lapse rate of 4.5% pa : and 5% decrease in both mortality and morbidity rates disclosed separately for life assurance and annuity business.
No future management actions are modelled in reaction to the changing non-economic assumptions.
In each sensitivity calculation all other assumptions remain unchanged.
No changes to valuation bases have been included.
