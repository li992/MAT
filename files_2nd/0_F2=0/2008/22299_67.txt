Share-based payment The Group implemented a long-term incentive scheme in 2006.
The scheme includes an element payable in shares, which has resulted in expenses during the year of 4.6m 2007 8.5m.
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment, the recognition of those share related expenses resulted in the creation of a bonus reserve within equity.
The scheme will result in the grant of shares, some of which will attract matching shares if the Groups performance meets certain conditions in the future.
For each share that attracts matching shares, the scheme allows the Group to grant: Up to one matching share on satisfaction of a market condition test, which compares the Groups growth in total shareholder return to the growth in an index of comparator companies: and Up to one matching share on satisfaction of non-market condition tests, which compare the growth of net asset value per share with that of the UK retail price index.
The Group may grant proportional numbers of shares on partial satisfaction of the performance conditions.
The Group used an actuarial model to estimate the number of shares required to match the market condition related shares.
The model looked at the historic out-performance of the Group of comparator companies to determine the distribution of probabilities of outperformance and applied a stochastic analysis to determine the expected number of matching shares.
The Group estimated the number of non-market condition related matching shares by comparing the internal and market growth forecasts for net assets per share to the UK retail price index at relevant future balance sheet dates.
The Group bases the fair value of all the shares on estimated market values at the date of grant.
The Group grants shares issued under the scheme four months after the end of the year and the shares then vest three years after the grant date.
Accordingly, the total cost of the shares will be amortised over a period of 52 months, which is the period from the beginning of the service period until the end of the vesting period.
The Group has recognised twelve months worth of costs in 2008.
Costs associated with matching shares have also been amortised over the same period.
Each individual Group company that contributes to the consolidated profit for the year recognises its share of the cost of the shares awarded.
The estimated value of shares that the Group will grant and the associated costs excluding national insurance costs are as follows: Cost recognised Cost recognised Total cost in 2008 in 2007 m m m Shares granted in 2008 -- - Shares granted in 2007 Attracting matching shares 3.1 0.5 1.4 Not attracting matching shares 7.1 1.6 1.6 Matching shares: market conditions 0.8 0.2 0.2 Matching shares: non-market conditions 2.1 0.5 0.5 1 Adjustment to 2007 declared bonus 3.0 1.5 - 10.1 1.3 3.7 Shares granted in 2006 Attracting matching shares 1.9 0.4 0.4 Not attracting matching shares 11.2 2.7 2.8 Matching shares: market conditions 0.6 0.1 0.1 Matching shares: non-market conditions 2.6 0.6 1.2 2005 matching shares: market conditions 0.4 0.1 - 2005 matching shares: non-market conditions 0.5 0.1 0.3 1 Adjustment to 2007 declared bonus 2.3 0.7 - 14.9 3.3 4.8 25.0 4.6 8.5 1 The adjustments to previous years bonus refer to adjustments to the cost of matching shares previously calculated, due to the yearly update of the assumptions behind the calculations, such as number of shares in circulation and profit forecasts.
