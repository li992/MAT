The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan both UK have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections had already closed to new entrants in 2002 03.
During the year, following consultation with members, it was decided that future benefit accruals for existing members of these sections would cease from 1 December 2014.
The members would then join the existing defined contribution section, which was established within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
This closure to future benefit accruals resulted in a curtailment gain of 4,246,000 before closure costs of 298,000, which has been included in the Adjustments column in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Overseas subsidiaries have adopted mainly defined contribution schemes, with the exception of two small defined benefit schemes in the Swiss entities of Medicel AG and Robutec GmbH.
Defined contribution schemes The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 4,042,000 2013: 3,658,000 and represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the ancillary contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
Defined benefit schemes The Groups significant defined benefit schemes are for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries.
Under the schemes, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 60, for members of the Executive Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employees.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The schemes are funded schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out at 1 December 2011 by Mr Adrian Gibbons, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
Mr Gibbons also carried out the 1 April 2012 actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan on the same basis.
