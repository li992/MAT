Post employment benefits We operate a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for our employees.
The Groups largest defined benefit schemes are in the UK.
For further details see Critical accounting judgements in note 1 Basis of preparation to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position.
Scheme liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date.
Assets are valued at market value.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements.
The interest cost less the expected return on assets is also charged to the income statement.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Groups share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.
The Groups contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses at 1 April 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised in the statement of financial position.
Background At 31 March 2014 the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The Groups pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements.
Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria.
Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.
The Group operates defined benefit schemes in Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK and the United States.
Defined contribution pension schemes are currently provided in Australia, Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, SouthAfrica, Spain and the UK.

The Vodafone UK plan and the CWWRP plan closed to future accrual on 31 March 2010 and 30 November 2013, respectively.
Until 30 November 2013 the CWWRP allowed employees to accrue a pension th at a rate of 1 85 of their final salary for each year of service until the retirement age of 60 with a maximum pension of two thirds of final salary.
Employees contributed 5% of their salary into the scheme.
The CWWRP is expected to merge with the Vodafone UK plan during the second quarter of 2014.
The defined benefit plans are administered by Trustee Boards that are legally separated from the Group.
The Trustee Board of each pension fund consists of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company.
The Board of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interest of the plan participants and are responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment and contribution policies and the governance of the fund.
The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of members, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the plans.

Post employment benefits continued Actuarial assumptions The Groups scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit method using the principal actuarial assumptions set out below: 2014 2013 2012 % % % 1 Weighted average actuarial assumptions used at 31 March : 2 Rate of inflation 3.2 3.3 3.0 Rate of increase in salaries 3.1 3.8 2.9 Discount rate 4.2 4.3 4.7 Notes: 1 Figures shown represent a weighted average assumption of the individual schemes.
2 The rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred payment is the rate of inflation.
Mortality assumptions used are based on recommendations from the individual scheme actuaries which include adjustments for the experience of the Group where appropriate.
The largest schemes in the Group are the UK schemes.

Post employment benefits continued Funding plans are individually agreed for each of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes with the respective trustees, taking into account local regulatory requirements.
It is expected that contributions of 400 million will be paid into the Groups defined benefit pension schemes during the year ending 31 March 2015, including a special one-off contribution of 325 million payable into the Vodafone UK plan and 40 million into the CWWRP in April 2014.
These one-off contributions represent accelerated funding amounts that would have been due for each scheme over the period to 31 March 2020.
The Group has also provided certain guarantees in respect of the UK schemes: further details are provided in note 30, Contingent liabilities.
Duration of the benefit obligations The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 March 2014 is 21.7 years 2013: 21.4 years, 2012: 23.6 years.
Fair value of pension assets 2014 2013 m m Cash and cash equivalents 65 117 Equity investments: With quoted prices in an active market 1,318 1,310 Without quoted prices in an active market 102 129 Debt instruments: With quoted prices in an active market 1,320 1,129 Without quoted prices in an active market Property 20 36 1 Derivatives 541 485 Annuity policies 476 517 Total 3,842 3,723 Note: 1 Derivatives include collateral held in the form of cash.
The schemes have no direct investments in the Groups equity securities or in property currently used by the Group.
Each of the plans manage risks through a variety of methods and strategies including equity protection, to limit downside risk in falls in equity markets, inflation and interest rate hedging and, in the CWWRP, a substantial insured pensioner buy-in policy.
The actual return on plan assets over the year to 31 March 2014 was 48 million 2013: 335 million.
Sensitivity analysis Measurement of the Groups defined benefit retirement obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions.
The sensitivity analysis below shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2014.
Rate of inflation Rate of increase in salaries Discount rate Life expectancy Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 0.5% Increase by 1 year Decrease by 1 year m m m m m m m m Decrease increase in present value of defined obligation 349 382 18 20 512 439 103 103 The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another.
In presenting this sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated on the same basis as prior years using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position.
