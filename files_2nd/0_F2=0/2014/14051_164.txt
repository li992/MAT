Serco Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 11.
Exceptional Items continued Impairment Relating to Global Services Business Transferred to Assets Held for Sale As part of the Strategic Review certain assets have been designated as non-core and are disclosed in the balance sheet as held for sale.
Consequently a calculation of the fair value of the Global Services businesses has been performed and resulted in an impairment of the carrying value of assets of 39.2m.
This relates to an impairment of the UK part of the Global Services business.
Impairment of Goodwill As goodwill is not amortised, it is tested for impairment annually or if there are indications that it might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of each cash generating unit CGU is based on value in use calculations derived from forecast cash flows based on past experience, adjusted to reflect market trends, economic conditions and key risks.
These forecasts include an appropriate level of new business wins and an assumption that the final year forecast continues on into perpetuity at a CGU specific terminal growth rate that does not exceed the forecast GDP growth for the relevant market of the business.
The output of the Strategic Review identified a non-cash exceptional impairment of goodwill of 466.0m in relation to the reduction in the carrying value of net assets to the estimated recoverable amounts in the CGUs of the Group.
The impairments arise as a result of two key issues.
Firstly, forecasts of cash flows have been significantly impacted by the Strategy Review undertaken during the year, and secondly, the discount rates applied in the impairment calculations have increased to reflect the changing level of risk associated with the business and the fall in the Groups market capitalisation.
