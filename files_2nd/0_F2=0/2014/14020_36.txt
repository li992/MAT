Share Registrars All shareholder records are maintained by Equinti and all correspondence should be addressed to the Registrars, Senior plc at the Equniti address shown on the inside back cover, quoting the reference number starting with 0228 detailed on your dividend vouchers.
The Registrars should be notified regarding changes to name or address, loss of share certificate, or request for, or change to, a dividend mandate.
Equiniti provides a range of shareholder information on-line.
Shareholders can check their holdings, update details and obtain practical help on transferring shares at: www.
Instead of payment by post to your registered address, dividends can be paid through the BACS system direct into a UK bank or building society account, with the dividend voucher still sent to your registered address.
If you wish to use this facility and have not previously applied, then please apply direct to Equiniti and request a dividend mandate form.
Shareholders who are currently receiving duplicate sets of Company mailings, as a result of any inconsistency in name or address details, should write direct to Equiniti so holdings can be combined, if appropriate.
