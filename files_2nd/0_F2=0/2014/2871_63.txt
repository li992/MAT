Contingent consideration has been calculated based on the Groups Currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 139.4 139.4 expectation of what it will pay in relation to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired entities by weighting the probability of a range of payments to give an estimate of the final obligation.

Interest rate risk As at 31 December 2014, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the Groups long term debt.

Assets measured at fair value Non-designated foreign exchange forward contracts 0.1 The Group has primarily issued fixed rate coupon US$ denominated bonds, which have been swapped to floating rate GBP liabilities at the date Interest rate swaps in relation to GBP denominated bonds 9.8 7.7 of issuance using currency swaps.
These currency swaps are designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of the bonds due to Currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 175.6 139.4 changes in prevailing foreign currency exchange and interest rates.
Liabilities measured at fair value In February 2008, Capita executed a series of fixed rate interest rate swaps to convert from paying floating rate GBP interest to fixed rate GBP Bonds 1,181.8 1,142.3 interest on certain of its swapped bonds.
Up to June 2012, the counterparty held the option to cancel these swaps on each semi-annual coupon Cash flow hedges 18.7 30.2 payment date.
In June 2012, the counterpartys option to cancel was removed, the duration of the swaps was extended and the fixed rate was Non-designated foreign exchange forward contracts 1.2 1.8 reduced, taking advantage of the lower prevailing interest rate environment.
These fixed rate interest rate swaps are not designated in any hedge Currency swaps in relation to US$ denominated bonds 0.6 13.5 relationship so their change in fair value is recognised in net finance costs in the income statement see note 9 Net finance costs.

This movement Contingent consideration 56.1 35.2 results in a non-cash accounting loss in the year of 36.7m 2013: gain of 26.3m.
In addition to the fixed rate bonds of 753.1m in issue as at 31 December 2014 underlying value not adjusted for the impact of the swaps, the Group had a further 371.0m of swapped bonds, a 300.0m 2-year term loan and a 600.0m undrawn committed revolving credit facility, all paying floating rate interest.
This gives the Group, as a whole, a balanced interest rate risk profile through the use of both fixed and floating rate financial instruments.

It is the Groups policy to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the underlying cash flows in order to maximise hedge effectiveness.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had cash flow hedges in place against forecast monthly INR costs in 2015 and each year up to and including 2019.
These forecast INR costs have been determined on the basis of the underlying cash flows associated with the delivery of services under signed contracts which run to 2019.

In general, under such agreements the amounts owed to each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single amount that is payable by one party to the other.
In certain circumstances e. g. when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.
The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial position.
This is because the Group does not have any currently enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events such as a default on the bank loans or other credit events.
In addition, the Groups banks have the right to set off amounts owed to them under ISDA master netting agreements and loans against cash amounts held by the relevant Group member with that bank, but only in certain circumstances e. g. when a credit event such as a default occurs.
The Group also has notional cash pools with its banks under which the bank may net cash balances with overdrafts held by other members of the Group.
