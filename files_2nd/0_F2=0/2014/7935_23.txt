82 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2014 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 3 Segment Information Imperial Tobacco comprises two distinct businesses Tobacco and Logistics.
The Tobacco business comprises the manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products, including sales to but not by the Logistics business.
The Logistics business comprises the distribution of tobacco products for tobacco product manufacturers, including Imperial Tobacco, as well as a wide range of non-tobacco products and services.
The Logistics business is run on an operationally neutral basis ensuring all customers are treated equally, and consequently transactions between the Tobacco and Logistics businesses are undertaken on an arms length basis reflecting market prices for comparable goods and services.
The Tobacco business is managed based on the strategic role of groups of markets rather than their geographic proximity, with divisions focused on prioritising growth or returns.
Returns Markets are typically mature markets where we have relatively large market shares and our objective is to maximise returns over the long term by growing profits while actively managing market share.
Growth Markets are mainly large profit or volume pools where we typically have market shares below 15 per cent and where our total tobacco approach provides many opportunities for share and profit growth both now and in the future.
The function of Chief Operating Decision Maker defined in IFRS 8, which is to review performance and allocate resources, is performed by the Board and the Chief Executive, who are regularly provided with information on our segments.
This information is used as the basis of the segment revenue and profit disclosures provided below.

The programme includes major restructuring of a number of sales forces to align with our strategy, rationalisation of our manufacturing footprint, and aligning organisational structures, processes and resource levels with future requirements.
A number of initiatives delivered savings of over 60 million in our 2014 results 2013: 30 million.
Asset impairments in 2014 relate mainly to the proposed closure of our manufacturing facilities in Nottingham and Nantes while in 2013 they were mainly due to the closure of our facility in Cadiz.
Restructuring costs are included within administrative and other expenses in the consolidated income statement.

Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by taking into account the weighted average number of shares that would be issued if rights held under the employee share schemes were exercised.
No instruments have been excluded from the calculation for any period on the grounds that they are anti-dilutive.

Supply agreements include Logistics customer relationships and exclusive supply arrangements in Cuba.
All were acquired under the purchase of Altadis.
In November 2013, the Group acquired e-vapour intellectual property rights from the Hong Kong based company Dragonite for 46 million.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2014 89 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 11 Intangible Assets continued With effect from 1 October 2013 we have revised the estimated useful lives over which certain brands, trademarks and supply agreements in the Tobacco business will be amortised.
In line with our strategy to focus on Growth and Specialist Brands, we have reduced the estimated remaining useful lives for all other brands to a maximum of five years.
This change in estimate is the main reason for the increase in the charge for amortisation of acquired intangibles for the year ended 30 September 2014.
Impairment charges in 2013 of 0.6 billion were in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets relating to the Spanish market.
Intangible amortisation and impairment are included within administrative and other expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Amortisation and impairment in respect of intangible assets other than software are treated as reconciling items between reported operating profit and adjusted operating profit.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment review Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
For the Tobacco business CGUs are based on the markets where the business operates and are grouped in line with the divisional structure in operation during the year.
The groupings represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill and intangible assets have been reallocated from the previously reported geographically based CGU groupings.
A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives is set out below.
2014 2013 Intangible Intangible assets with assets with million Goodwill indefinite lives Goodwill indefinite lives Returns Markets North 3,948 177 4,243 190 Returns Markets South 1,484 93 1,597 100 Growth Markets 3,611 495 3,728 507 Tobacco 9,043 765 9,568 797 Logistics 1,525 1,640 10,568 765 11,208 797 Goodwill has arisen principally on the acquisitions of Reemtsma in 2002 all CGU groupings, Commonwealth Brands in 2007 Growth Markets and Altadis in 2008 all CGU groupings.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The value of a CGU, or group of CGUs as appropriate, is based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections derived from three year financial plans which are approved by the Board annually and are based on detailed bottom-up market-by-market forecasts of projected sales volumes for each product line.
These forecasts reflect, on an individual market basis, numerous assumptions and estimates regarding anticipated changes in market size, prices and duty regimes, consumer uptrading and downtrading, consumer preferences and other changes in product mix, based on long-term market trends, market data, anticipated regulatory developments, and management experience and expectations.
We consider that pricing, market size, market shares and cost inflation are the key assumptions used in our plans.
Growth rates and discount rates used The compound annual growth rates implicit in these value-in-use calculations are shown below.
2014 Pre-tax Initial Long-term % discount rate growth rate growth rate Returns Markets North 8.9 1.9 1.8 Returns Markets South 11.6 2.2 1.8 Growth Markets 8.6-12.9 0.9-23.4 1.8-4.0 Logistics 9.6 7.8 1.8 Cash flows from the three year plan period are extrapolated out to year five using the growth rate implicit in the three year plan, shown in the table above as the initial growth rate.
Estimated long-term weighted average compound annual growth rates of between 1.8 per cent and 4.0 per cent per annum are used beyond year five.
Long-term growth rates are based on managements long-term expectations, taking account of industry specific factors such as the nature of our products, the role of excise in government fiscal policy, and relatively stable and predictable long-term macro trends in the Tobacco industry.
Discount rates used are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the different risk profiles of the CGUs.
Our impairment projections are prepared under the basis set out in IAS 36 which can differ from our internal plans.
90 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2014 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Growth Markets Within our Growth Markets reporting segment, there are a number of CGU groupings based on our operating segments, including Drive Growth and Other Premium Cigar.
The Drive Growth CGU grouping includes our markets in Russia, Italy and Japan, and has been affected in 2014 by destocking in Russia, the major market in this CGU grouping.
Our impairment test for this CGU grouping indicated headroom of 240 million, and assumed a compound annual growth rate for Russia over the first five years of 23.4 per cent, reflecting maintenance of more consistent levels of trade inventory together with price increases achieved in 2014 and anticipated over the plan period.
The test also assumed a discount rate for the Russian market of 12.9 per cent reflecting recent political uncertainty and a long-term growth rate of 3.0 per cent.
A reduction of 24 per cent in overall forecast cash flows, or an increase in the discount rate by 290 basis points, or a reduction in the long-term growth rate of 300 basis points, or a further 24 per cent devaluation of the Russian rouble would cause the carrying value to equal the recoverable amount.
The impairment test for our Other Premium Cigar CGU grouping that includes our non-Cuban Premium Cigar business indicated headroom of 170 million.
A reduction in overall forecast cash flows of 25 per cent, or an increase in the discount rate by 240 basis points from 9.9 per cent, or a reduction in the short-term growth rate of 630 basis points from 9.8 per cent, or a reduction in the long-term growth rate of 180 basis points from 2.3 per cent would cause the carrying value to equal the recoverable amount.
Other CGU groupings For the rest of the Group, any reasonable movement in the assumptions used in the impairment tests would not result in an impairment.

For future results, equity accounting will be compulsory for joint arrangements, and our current policy of proportionately consolidating joint ventures results and assets and liabilities will no longer be permitted.
If the standard had been in effect in FY14, the revenue and profit after taxation figures above for 2014 would not have been included in revenue and profit after taxation in the Groups consolidated income statement.
Instead, the profit and loss items would have been shown in the consolidated income statement below net finance costs as post-tax share of investments accounted for using the equity method.
Similarly, the asset and liability amounts would not have been included in the corresponding line items in the Groups consolidated balance sheet, but would have been reclassified as Investments accounted for using the equity method.

It is generally recognised industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the processing cycle, ordinarily would not be consumed within one year.
We estimate that around 250 million 2013: 262 million of leaf tobacco held within raw materials will not be utilised within a year of the balance sheet date.

This note explains the Groups exposure to these risks, how they are measured and assessed, and summarises the policies and processes used to manage them, including those related to the management of capital.
The Group operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing external and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of the Groups strategic objectives, specifically its exposure to funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty credit risk.
Imperial Tobacco operates on a global basis and manages its capital to ensure that subsidiaries are able to operate as going concerns and to optimise returns to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The Groups treasury activities are monitored by the Group Treasury Committee GTC, which meets regularly throughout the year and comprises the Chief Financial Officer, the Company Secretary and other senior management from Group Finance, Manufacturing and Group Treasury.
The GTC operates in accordance with the terms of reference set out by the Board and a framework which sets out the expectations and boundaries to assist in the effective oversight of Group Treasury activities.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, and to the GTC on a monthly basis.
The Board reviews and approves all major treasury decisions and Group Treasury does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions.
Market risk Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk or financial instrument price risk other than its pension assets disclosed in note 22.
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be fluctuations in the price of tobacco leaf.
As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations influence tobacco plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown.
Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price.
The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from a number of different countries and counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.
Currently, these techniques reduce the expected exposure to this risk to levels considered not material and accordingly, no sensitivity analysis has been presented.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading transactions denominated in foreign currencies, as well as cash investments, borrowings and derivatives in non-functional currencies.
The Groups financial results are principally exposed to fluctuations in euro and US dollar exchange rates.
Foreign currency transaction exposures arising on internal and external trade flows are not hedged.
The Group minimises the transaction risk associated with overseas operating subsidiaries by matching local currency flows where possible.
96 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2014 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Translation risk In order to reduce foreign currency translation exposure, the Group seeks to match borrowings to the currency of underlying net assets which are primarily euros and US dollars.
The Group has a policy of issuing debt in the most appropriate market or markets at the time of raising new finance and to subsequently enter into derivative financial instruments to change the currency of debt as required.
Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into foreign currencies to match the Groups investment in overseas assets are treated as a hedge against the net investment wherever possible.
Transaction risk The Groups material transaction exposures arise on costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of subsidiaries, including the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number of currencies.
The Groups sterling dividend to external shareholders is sourced from foreign subsidiary earnings.
Cash flows are managed using liquidity swaps in line with the Groups daily cash management processes, and the timing of internal and external dividend flows as appropriate.
Foreign exchange sensitivity analysis The tables below illustrate on an indicative basis, the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on monetary items held by Group companies in currencies other than their functional currencies.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that net debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain constant, and that there is no change to the net investment hedge designations in place at 30 September 2014.
The sensitivity analysis does not reflect any change to revenue or non-finance costs that may result from changing exchange rates and ignores any taxation implications and offsetting effects of derivative financial instruments fair value movements.
The effect in the consolidated income statement from foreign exchange rate movements primarily relates to financial instruments that commercially hedge Group exposures, but which are not accounted for as hedges under IAS 39.
This value is expected to be substantially offset by related movements through other comprehensive income and, accordingly, any residual gain or loss is excluded from our adjusted performance measures.
At 30 September 2014, after the effect of derivative financial instruments, approximately 17 per cent 2013: 25 per cent of reported net debt was denominated in sterling, 73 per cent in euro 2013: 69 per cent and 10 per cent in US dollars 2013: 6 per cent.

Interest rate risk Interest rate risk on Group borrowings is managed by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and subsequently entering into derivative financial instruments to change the currency and interest rate mix in line with the GTC framework.
Group Treasury monitors the Groups borrowing levels using adjusted net debt which excludes interest accruals and fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The Groups debt maturity profile is detailed in the contractual cash flows table below.
At 30 September 2014, including the effect of derivative financial instruments detailed in note 20, 71 per cent 2013: 49 per cent of reported net debt was at floating rates of interest and 29 per cent 2013: 51 per cent was at fixed rates of interest.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2014 97 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 19 Financial Risk Factors continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis The tables below illustrate on an indicative basis the Groups sensitivity to interest rates on its euro, US dollar and sterling monetary items which are primarily external borrowings, cash and cash equivalents.
The impact in the consolidated income statement due to changes in interest rates reflects the effect on net finance costs in respect of the Groups net debt and the fixed to floating rate debt ratio prevailing at 30 September 2014, and ignores any taxation implications and offsetting effects of derivative financial instruments fair value movements.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the net debt and derivatives portfolio remain constant and that there is no net impact on other comprehensive income.
The movement in interest rates is considered reasonable for the purposes of this analysis and the estimated effect assumes a lower limit of zero for interest rates where relevant.

To manage this risk the Group has a policy of actively maintaining a mixture of short, medium and long-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for the forecast requirements of the Group over the short to medium term.
To prevent over-reliance on individual sources of liquidity, funding is provided by a range of instruments including bank loans, commercial paper and capital market issuance.
Counterparty credit risk associated with the Groups investment and derivative portfolio is discussed in the credit risk section below.
The Group borrows centrally in order to meet forecast funding requirements, and Group Treasury is in regular dialogue with subsidiaries to ensure their liquidity needs are met.
Subsidiary companies are funded by a combination of share capital and retained earnings, loans from central finance companies, and in very limited cases through external local borrowings.
Cash pooling structures are used to centralise cash and minimise external borrowings as appropriate and cash flow forecasts and funding requirements are reviewed by Group Treasury on a regular basis.
Management periodically performs stress tests and sensitivity analysis on forecasts, which are subsequently reviewed by the Audit Committee.
The table below summarises the Groups financial liabilities by maturity based on their contractual cash flows.
The contractual cash flows disclosed in the table include interest to be paid, are undiscounted and have been calculated using spot rates of exchange at the relevant balance sheet date.

The Group defines capital as adjusted net debt and equity attributable to the owners of the Company.
Besides the minimum capitalisation rules that may apply to subsidiaries in different countries, the Groups only externally imposed capital requirements are interest cover and gearing covenants contained within external debt facilities, within which the Group was fully compliant during the current and prior periods and expects to be so going forward.
The Group seeks to maintain an investment grade credit rating which it monitors by reference to a number of key financial ratios.
The framework within which the Groups capital base is managed includes the return of capital to shareholders through an appropriate mix of share buy backs and dividends.
In order to accelerate the pace of debt repayment associated with the acquisition of certain US assets as announced in July 2014, the Group has suspended its share buy-back programme.
As at 30 September 2014 c14.2 million shares had been repurchased during the financial year at a cost of approximately 341 million 2013: 500 million.
The Group is currently rated Baa3 negative outlook by Moodys Investors Service Limited, BBB stable outlook by Standard & Poors Credit Market Services Europe Limited and BBB negative outlook by Fitch Ratings Limited.
The Groups investment grade credit rating is not expected to be impacted by the US acquisition.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk arising from trade receivables due from its customers, cash deposits and financial instruments held with external counterparties.
Trade and other receivables The Group has some significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
However, policies have been implemented to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and credit support or guarantees are obtained where appropriate.
Analysis of trade and other receivables is provided in note 15.
Financial instruments In order to manage its credit risk to any one counterparty, the Group places cash deposits and enters into derivative financial instruments with a diversified group of financial institutions carrying suitable credit ratings in line with GTC approved limits.
Utilisation of counterparty credit limits is regularly monitored by Group Treasury and to reduce credit exposures, the Group has ISDA Agreements in place with most of its counterparties which permit net settlement of assets and liabilities in certain circumstances.
In very limited cases, collateral is deposited against derivative financial liabilities which are all supported by an ISDA Credit Support Annex.
The Group considers its maximum aggregate credit risk to be 4,722 million at 30 September 2014 2013: 5,175 million, which includes trade receivables, derivative financial assets and cash and cash equivalents.
The table below summarises the Groups five largest financial institution counterparties, based on maximum exposure to credit risk, by credit rating and balances at 30 September 2014.
As at the balance sheet date, management does not expect these counterparties to default on their current obligations.
The impact of the Groups own credit risk on the fair value of derivatives and other obligations held at fair value is not considered to be material.

However, the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting.
As a result, and as permitted under IAS 39, the Group has decided not to apply cash flow or fair value hedge accounting for its derivative financial instruments.
The Group does apply net investment hedging, designating certain borrowings and derivatives as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations as permitted by IAS 39, in order to minimise income statement volatility.
Interest rate swaps As outlined in note 19, interest rate risk on Group borrowings is managed by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and then using derivative financial instruments to change the debt into the appropriate proportions of fixed and floating interest rates in accordance with the GTC framework where necessary.
Interest rate swaps entered into to change fixed rate borrowings into floating rate borrowings are as follows: 2014 million unless otherwise indicated Notional Fair value Receiving rates Paying rates GBP 3,670 281 3.7% to 8.7% LIBOR plus 212bps to 511bps EUR 4,081 255 2.2% to 8.0% EURIBOR plus 109bps to 503bps USD 1,390 12 2.0% to 3.4% LIBOR plus 94bps to 126bps 9,141 524 2013 million unless otherwise indicated Notional Fair value Receiving rates Paying rates GBP 1,166 268 5.4% to 8.7% LIBOR plus 269bps to 511bps EUR 4,954 238 3.9% to 8.0% EURIBOR plus 55bps to 503bps USD 452 24 2.0% to 3.4% LIBOR plus 94bps to 126bps 6,572 482 Interest rate swaps entered into to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate risk are as follows: 2014 million unless otherwise indicated Notional Fair value Paying rates Receiving GBP 1,266 96 2.7% to 4.4% LIBOR EUR 5,193 558 0.8% to 5.2% EURIBOR USD 1,483 18 1.4% to 4.1% LIBOR 7,942 672 2013 million unless otherwise indicated Notional Fair value Paying rates Receiving GBP 2,600 125 3.0% to 4.4% LIBOR EUR 5,166 436 1.5% to 5.2% EURIBOR USD 1,452 23 1.4% to 4.1% LIBOR 9,218 584 A small number of the interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk have embedded options.
Assumptions have been made based on market information and from counterparties expectations at 30 September 2014 to determine whether, and if so when, such options are likely to be exercised in order to determine the probable maturity date.
The actual maturity date could be earlier depending upon future market conditions and a cancellation would not result in a cash flow other than in respect of interest outstanding at the cancellation date.
The effect of the cancellation of any of these interest rate swaps would be to reduce the proportion of the Groups borrowings that were at a fixed rate, increasing the Groups exposure to cash flow interest rate risk.
Included in the above are forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 2,729 million equivalent 2013: 1,266 million equivalent with tenors extending between 5 and 10 years, starting between October 2015 and May 2017.
The fair value of these swaps was a net liability of 115 million 2013: net liability of 43 million as at the balance sheet date.
Forward foreign currency contracts The Group has entered into forward currency contracts to manage short-term foreign currency exposures.
As at 30 September 2014 the notional amount of these contracts was 1,146 million equivalent 2013: 3,011 million equivalent and the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of nil 2013: 47 million net liability.
102 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2014 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Cross currency swaps The Group enters into cross currency swaps to change the currency of debt into the appropriate currency with consideration to the underlying assets of the Group as appropriate.
As at 30 September 2014, the notional amount of cross currency swaps entered into to convert issued fixed rate debt into the desired currency at floating rates of interest was 650 million 2013: 650 million and the fair value liability of these swaps was 30 million 2013: 73 million net liability.
As at 30 September 2014, the notional amount of cross currency swaps entered into to convert floating rate sterling debt into the desired currency at floating rates of interest was 2,000 million 2013: 1,000 million and the fair value asset of these swaps was 71 million 2013: 1 million net liability.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations As at 30 September 2014 external debt with a carrying value of 5,165 million 2013: 6,507 million and cross currency swaps with a notional value of 2,461 million 2013: 2,835 million have been designated as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations.
To the extent that these hedges are effective, gains or losses on the retranslation of these borrowings and derivatives are recognised in other comprehensive income to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the Groups foreign operations.
Permanent intra-group loans with a fair value of 5,440 million 2013: 5,608 million as at the balance sheet date have been treated as a reduction in investments in the Groups foreign operations, in line with IAS 21.
During the year, as a result of net investment hedging, foreign exchange gains amounting to 831 million 2013: 662 million losses were transferred to reserves through other comprehensive income.

As at the balance sheet date, deferred tax assets of 373 million 2013: 598 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the underlying tax losses in certain jurisdictions.
Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets, 332 million 2013: 486 million losses are expected to expire at approximately 50 million 2013: 60 million per annum between 2015 and 2021, 11 million 2013: 12 million are expected to expire within 5 years and 27 million are expected to expire between 2022 and 2026.
Also within Other temporary differences, deferred tax assets of 10 million 2013: 22 million are recognised for tax credits carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the tax related benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
Deferred tax assets of 229 million 2013: 131 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the credits.
These unrecognised deferred tax assets are expected to expire between 2021 and 2027.
We have reviewed the recoverability of deferred tax assets in an overseas territory in the light of forecast business performance.
Consequently, we have increased deferred tax assets of 90 million 2013: 76 million reduction previously fide-recognised on the basis that it is more likely than not that these are recoverable.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 7 billion 2013: 7 billion.
A provision of 4 million 2013: 6 million has been made for taxation expected to arise on a planned future dividend payment of 54 million from one subsidiary.
No liability has been recognised in respect of other differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax liability of 48 million arising on an internal disposal has not been recognised as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is probable that the liability will not crystallise in the foreseeable future.
In addition, the liability is less than current unrecognised deferred tax assets which will be available to reduce the liability to nil.
The rate of UK corporation tax was reduced by 2 per cent from 23 per cent to 21 per cent from 1 April 2014.
A further reduction to 20 per cent from 1 April 2015 was enacted at the balance sheet date and is reflected in the deferred tax balances.
22 Retirement Benefit Schemes The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes for its employees, including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The Groups two principal schemes are defined benefit schemes and are operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited in the UK and Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH in Germany: these schemes represent 71 per cent and 12 per cent of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations and 61 per cent and 15 per cent of the current service cost respectively.
During the year ITG has adopted IAS 19 Revised with effects as described in note 1, Accounting Policies, and also resulting in the revised presentation formats set out below.
Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund The UK scheme the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund or ITPF is a voluntary final salary pension scheme with a normal retirement age of 60 for most members.
The ITPF is offered to employees who joined the company before 1 October 2010 and has a weighted average maturity of 16 years.
The population comprises 59 per cent in respect of pensioners, 37 per cent in respect of deferred members and 4 per cent in respect of active employees.
New employees in the UK are now offered a defined contribution scheme.
Should surplus funds arise in the defined benefit section they may be used to finance defined contribution section contributions with company contributions reduced accordingly.
The ITPF operates under trust law and is managed and administered by the Trustees on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation.
The ITPFs assets are held by the trust.
Annual increases in benefits in payment are dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the ITPF are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increases and the actual longevity of the membership.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2014 105 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 22 Retirement Benefit Schemes continued Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund continued The contributions paid to the ITPF are set by the ITPF Scheme Actuary every three years.
The Scheme Actuary is an external consultant, appointed by the Trustees.
Principal factors that the Scheme Actuary will have regard to include the covenant offered by Imperial Tobacco Limited, the level of risk in the ITPF, the expected returns on the ITPFs assets, the results of the funding assessment on an ongoing basis and the expected cost of securing benefits if the fund were to be discontinued.
The latest valuation of the ITPF was carried out as at 31 March 2013 when the market value of the invested assets was 2,957 million.
Based on the ongoing funding target the total assets were sufficient to cover 100 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 90 per cent of the total benefits that had accrued to members for past service and future service benefits for current members.
In compliance with the Pensions Act 2004, Imperial Tobacco Limited and the Trustee agreed a scheme-specific funding target, statement of funding principles and a schedule of contributions accordingly.
Following the valuation, the level of employers contributions to the scheme was increased from 31 million per year.
The Company paid 47.5 million on 31 March 2014 and agreed to pay 52.5 million in the year to 31 March 2015, 57.5 million in the year to 31 March 2016 and 65 million each year for the subsequent 12 years.
Further contributions were agreed to be paid by the Company in the event of a downgrade in the credit rating of Imperial Tobacco Groups senior unsecured long-term debt.
In addition, surety guarantees with a total value of 400 million and a parental guarantee with ITG have been put in place.
The contributions agreed, plus the surety guarantees, cover the expected discontinuance cost as at the valuation date.
The Scheme Actuary prepares an annual update of the funding position as at 31 March each year.
The latest annual update on an ongoing basis was carried out as at 31 March 2014 and showed a surplus of 196 million in relation to past service accrued benefits.
The main risk for the Group in respect of the ITPF is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns are not sufficient to pay for the benefits which will be influenced by the factors noted above.
The level of equity returns will be a key determinant of overall investment return.
The investment portfolio is also subject to a range of other risks typical of the asset classes held, in particular credit risk on bonds and exposure to the property market.
The IAS 19 liability measurement of the defined benefit obligation DBO and the current service cost are sensitive to the assumptions made about future inflation and salary growth levels, as well as the assumptions made about life expectation.
They are also sensitive to the discount rate, which depends on market yields on sterling denominated AA corporate bonds.
The main differences between the funding and IAS 19 assumptions are a more prudent longevity assumption for funding and a different approach to setting the discount rate.
A consequence of the ITPFs investment strategy, with a significant proportion of the assets invested in equities and other return-seeking assets, is that the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 liabilities may be relatively volatile.
The Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken Pension Plan The German scheme, the Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken Pension Plan RCPP, is primarily a career average pension plan that is open to new entrants, though a small closed group of members has final salary benefits.
It has a weighted average maturity of 17 years.
The scheme population comprises 53 per cent in respect of pensioners, 16 per cent in respect of deferred members and 31 per cent in respect of active employees.
The plan is unfunded and the company pays benefits as they arise.
The plans obligations arise under a works council agreement and are subject to standard German legal requirements around such matters as the benefits to be provided to employees who leave service, and pension increases in payment.
Over the next year Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH expects to pay 20 million in respect of benefits.
Annual increases in benefits in payment are dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the plan are future inflation levels and the actual longevity of the membership.
The IAS 19 liability measurement of the defined benefit obligation and the current service cost are sensitive to the assumptions made about the above variables, as well as the discount rate, which depends on market yields on euro denominated AA corporate bonds.
106 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2014 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Other plans Other plans of the Group include various pension plans, other post-employment and long-term employee benefit plans in several countries of operation.
Many of the plans are funded, with assets backing the obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts, others are operated on an unfunded basis.
The benefits provided, the approach to funding and the legal basis of the plans reflect their local environments.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate for calculating the DBO and service cost is set according to the level of relevant market yields on corporate bonds where the market is considered deep, or government bonds where it is not.
The results of the most recent available actuarial valuations for the various plans have been updated to 30 September 2014 in order to determine the amounts to be included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The aggregate IAS 19 position is as follows: Defined benefit plans 2014 2013 restated million DBO Assets Total DBO Assets Total At 1 October 4,400 3,350 1,050 4,138 3,095 1,043 Consolidated income statement expense Current service cost 49 49 55 55 Past service credit Spanish free tobacco settlement 52 52 2 2 Past service credit curtailment 69 69 3 3 Settlement 1 1 Cost of termination benefits 32 32 15 15 Net interest expense income on net defined benefit liability asset 174 138 36 167 128 39 Administration costs paid from plan assets 3 3 2 2 Cost recognised in the income statement 1 105 Remeasurements Actuarial gain loss due to liability experience 38 38 5 5 Actuarial loss due to financial assumption changes 202 202 188 188 Actuarial gain loss due to demographic assumption changes 22 22 1 1 Return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest expense income above 187 187 237 237 Remeasurement effects recognised in OCI 45 43 Cash Employer contributions 116 116 98 98 Employee contributions 2 2 2 2 Benefits paid directly by the company 46 46 47 47 Benefits paid from plan assets 181 181 171 171 Net cash 116 98 Other Spanish free tobacco settlement 48 48 Exchange movements 88 28 60 53 10 43 Total other 108 43 At 30 September 4,315 3,535 780 4,400 3,350 1,050 During the year, there have been some special events that have impacted the liabilities and the cost of the Groups retirement benefit schemes.
The announcement of the proposed closure of the Nottingham factory has given rise to a curtailment gain of 55 million and termination costs of 25 million.
Other redundancies in the United Kingdom and Germany gave rise to termination costs of 7 million.
We reached an agreement in Spain with around 70 per cent of pensioners who had previously received payments in respect of former entitlements to free cigarettes to accept a one-off cash payment in full settlement.
This has given rise to a past service credit of 52 million.
The cash settlement of 48 million was paid at the beginning of October 2014 and the liability was recognised in the balance sheet at 30 September 2014 in other liabilities.
In The Netherlands the defined benefit scheme has been replaced by a multi-employer scheme for most employees which is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme under IAS 19, because it is not possible to determine the Groups share of the plan assets and by a defined contribution plan for some employees.
As a consequence of these changes a curtailment gain of 14 million has been recognised.

In particular for the ITPF, SAPS tables are used with various adjustments for different groups of members, reflecting observed experience.
The largest group of members uses the SAPS All Pensioner Male Amounts table with a 109.8 per cent multiplier.
An allowance for improvements in longevity is made using the continuous mortality investigation improvement rates with a long-term trend of 1.25 per cent per annum.
108 Imperial Tobacco Group PLCAnnual Report and Accounts 2014 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS Sensitivity analysis for key assumption at the end of the reporting period Sensitivity analysis is illustrative only and is provided to demonstrate the degree of sensitivity of results to key assumptions.
Generally, estimates are made by re-performing calculations with one assumption modified and all others held constant.

We estimate that a 0.5 per cent decrease increase in the discount rate at the start of the reporting period would have increased decreased the consolidated income statement pension expense by approximately 15 million.

25 Share Schemes The Group operates three types of share-based incentive programmes, designed to incentivise staff and to encourage them to build a stake in the Group.
Share Matching Scheme Awards are made to eligible employees who are invited to invest a proportion of their eligible bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC shares for a period of three years, after which additional shares are awarded on a 1:1 ratio.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards of shares under the LTIP are made to the Executive Directors and senior executives at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
They vest three years after grant and are subject to performance criteria.
Sharesave Plan Options are granted to eligible employees who participate in a designated savings scheme for a three or five year period.

This gave rise to goodwill of 41 million, largely representing the value of the sales force in place.
In July 2014, the Group entered into a purchase agreement with Reynolds American Inc. for the acquisition of assets, including a portfolio of US brands, plus the national sales force, offices and production facilities currently owned by Lorillard Inc.
The transaction is subject to the acquisition of Lorillard by Reynolds and requires US anti-trust and shareholder approvals.
The approval processes are likely to take a minimum of six to nine months.
If approved, the assets are to be acquired for cash consideration of $7.1 billion.
Costs of 13 million were incurred in 2014 in relation to the transaction, and have been excluded from our adjusted results in line with our accounting policy.

This increased non-controlling interest by 363 million.
Net proceeds after fees and costs were 395 million and were used to reduce the Groups debt.
A gain of 32 million was recognised in equity.
