The Company accounts for its investment in its direct subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. at fair value.
The Company, together with its direct subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and all the intermediate holding subsidiaries compose the Group investing in PPP assets the Group.
The net assets of the intermediate holding companies, which at 31 December principally comprise working capital balances, are required to be included at fair value in the carrying value of investments.
The primary impact of this change is that the cash balances in some intermediate subsidiaries are presented as part of the fair value of the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l..
This change does not affect the Net Assets.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED a Basis of accounting continued Changes in accounting policy In the current period, the Group has adopted the following accounting standards: Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Dec 2015 : Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sep 2014 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012-2014 Cycle Sep 2014 : Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012-2014 Cycle Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2011-13 Cycle Dec 2013 : Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2011-13 Cycle Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2010-12 Cycle Dec 2013 : Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2010-12 Cycle Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Following the adoption of the Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 the Company no longer consolidates on a line by line its Group but recognises the subsidiaries at fair value.
As a result of adopting the amendments, the Company recognises its investment in its subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. at fair value through profit or loss.
The fair value estimate of JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. includes the fair value of both this company and all of that companys subsidiaries and investments.
The following table summarises the key adjustments made to the Balance Sheet on implementation of the amended accounting policy.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED a Basis of accounting continued The effects on the Income Statement were as follows.
Results in the Impact of Restated year ended change in results 31 December accounting 31 December 2013 policy 2013 Income statement 000s 000s 000s Operating income 48,512 7,995 40,517 Administrative expenses 12,846 3,385 9,461 Other losses gains 387 387 Operating expenses 13,233 3,772 9,461 Finance costs 3,156 3,157 1 profit before tax 32,123 1,066 31,057 Tax 1,066 1,066 profit after tax 31,057 31,057 The impact of adopting Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 is the non-consolidation of assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the subsidiaries which were previously consolidated on a line by line basis and the recognition of the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. at fair value through profit or loss.
The above table also shows the effect of reclassication of these assets, liabilities, income and expenses to Investment at fair value through profit or loss.
Net assets The Net Assets at 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2013 reects the recognition of the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. at fair value.
This means that previously consolidated assets accounted at book value are now recognised at fair value and included in the Companys investment at fair value.
The categories of assets and liabilities have changed and the net impact of the restatement on the overall net assets is nil.
profit after tax Prior to adoption of the Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28, the Company consolidated its subsidiaries that were investment entities and recognised in its income statement, Interest and Dividend income received from PPP investments and the net gain or losses on investments at fair value.
The Company recognises in the restated profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2013 and in this years operating profit, the operating income which reects the change in fair value of the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. comprising the intermediate holding companies and the public-private partnership PPP asset portfolio.
Cash ow statement The restated Cash Flow Statement at 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2013 reects the adoption of Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28.
In the 2013 financial statements, the Cash Flow Statement included the Companys and the intermediate holding companies transactions.
As the Company now accounts for its investment in its sole direct subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss, the net cash inow from operations only includes the Company's transactions and not those within the Group as presented in the annual statements at 31 December 2013.
Similarly, the closing bank balance only includes the Companys balance.
The intermediate holding companies cash balances are included in investments at fair value in the balance sheet.
b Basis of consolidation The Company a Obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investor s with investment management services: b Commits to its investor s that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both: and c Measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
Consequently, the Company does not consolidate its subsidiaries or apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations when it obtains control of another entity as it is considered to be an Investment Entity under IFRSs.
Instead, the company measures its investment in its subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED b Basis of consolidation continued The financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company only.
Following the adoption of Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 issued in December 2014, the Company recognises its investment in its subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. at fair value through profit or loss see note 10.
The fair value estimate of JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. includes the fair value of both this company and all of the Companys subsidiaries and PPP investments.
The Company holds its portfolio of investments indirectly through JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. As stated earlier, the Company invests solely for capital appreciation, investment income, or both.
Consequently, the Company does not plan to holds its investments indefinitely.
The Company has an exit strategy for the portfolio of investments held indirectly.
JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. is itself an investment entity.
Consequently, the Company need not have an exit strategy for its investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. Similarly, any other subsidiaries that are investment entities themselves do not require an exit strategy to meet the denition of an investment entity.
Each investment indirectly held subordinated debt together with equity has a nite life.
The subordinated debt will mature towards the end of the concession and at the end of the concession the investment will be liquidated.
The exit strategy is that investments will normally be held to liquidation at the end of the concession unless the Company sees an opportunity in market to dispose of investments.
John Laing Capital Management Limited the Investment Advisor and JLIF Board regularly consider whether any disposals should be made.
c Going concern The Directors, in their consideration of going concern have reviewed comprehensive cash ow forecasts prepared by the Investment Adviser, which are based on prudent market data and past experience and believe, based on those forecasts and an assessment of the Companys and the Groups committed banking facilities, that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Company on the going concern basis.
In arriving at their conclusion that the Group has adequate financial resources, the Directors were mindful that the Group had unrestricted cash of 26.5 million including 4.5 million for the Company and a three year banking facility available for investment in new or existing projects and working capital of 150 million, which expires in February 2016 and a 11.9 million commitment refer to note 19 for details which can be fullled by the use of the Companys and the intermediate holding companies cash available.
The Directors and the Investment Adviser are currently in the process of securing a new banking facility which should be available to the Group upon expiry of the existing facility.
As at 31 December 2014, there was no amount drawn under the facility.
In addition, all key financial covenants are forecast to continue to be complied with.
The Company completed the following capital raises in the year: in May 2014, additional equity of 1.1 million was raised through Offer of a Scrip Dividend alternative to the dividend for the period 1 July 2013 to 31 December 2013: in September 2014, additional equity of 50.0 million was raised following a tap issue of 43.1 million shares: and in October 2014, additional equity of 1.5 million was raised through Offer of a Scrip Dividend alternative to the proposed dividend for the period 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2014.
The Company, through its intermediate holding companies, holds investments in 56 operational PPP project companies which yield annual interest, dividends and loan repayments.
The cash ow yields from the projects comfortably covers the Groups expected cash ow requirements for overheads and targeted dividend distribution policy.
The Company and its intermediate holding companies have sufficient financial resources together with their PPP investments public sector long-term contracts across a range of infrastructure projects.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Company and its intermediate holdings companies are well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Certain risks and uncertainties, as detailed in the note 18 have been considered by the Board.
The Board has concluded that these do not represent a significant threat to the Group as its income is generated from a portfolio of PPP concessions which are supported by government backed cash ows and are forecast to cover the Groups committed costs.
The Directors, at the time of approving the financial statements, are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these annual financial statements.
d Revenue recognition Operating income Operating income in the income statement represents the movement in the fair value of the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. refer to note 10 for details.

f Foreign currencies The financial statements are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the financial statements, the results and financial position of the Company and the underlying fair valued financial position of JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the financial statements.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
g Taxation Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company is exempt from paying taxes on income, profits or capital gains.
Dividend income and interest income received by the Group may be subject to withholding tax imposed in the country of origin of such income.
The underlying project companies in which the Group invests provide for and pay taxation at the appropriate rates in the countries in which they operate.
h Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash ows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement.
i Financial assets The Company classies its financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables.
The classication depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
The Company determines the classication of its financial assets at initial recognition.
a Investments at fair value through profit or loss Investments at fair value through profit or loss are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
In these financial statements, investment at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value of the Company's subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. which comprises the fair value of JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. all the intermediate holding companies and the PPP Investments.
JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and the intermediate holding companies net assets are mainly composed of cash and working capital balances and are recognised at fair value which is equivalent to their net assets.
The Company's investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. comprises both equity and a profit participating agreement PPA.
Both elements are exposed to the same primary risk, being performance risk.
This performance risk is taken into consideration when determining the discount rate applied to the forecast cash ows.
In determining fair value the Board considered observable market transactions and have measured fair value using assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset including assumptions regarding risk.
The profit participating agreement and equity are considered to have the same risk characteristics.
As such the profit participating agreement and equity form a single class of financial instrument for the purposes of disclosure.
The Company measures its investment as a single class of financial asset at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
b Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that are non-derivative financial assets and that have xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classied as loans and other receivables.
Loans and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
They are included in current assets, except where maturities are in greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date which are classied as Non-Current Assets.
The Companys loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED h Financial instruments continued ii Financial liabilities and equity Debt and equity instruments are classied as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
a Equity instruments share capital and share premium Ordinary shares are classied as equity.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or associated with the establishment of the Company that would otherwise have been avoided are written off against the balance of the Share Premium Account.
b Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classied as other financial liabilities, comprising of: Loans and borrowings which are recognised initially at fair value of the consideration received, less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loan and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis: and Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
iii Effective interest method The effective interest rate is that rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the relevant assets carrying amount.
iv Fair value estimation The Companys investments at fair value are not traded in active markets.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
In these financial statements, investment at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value of the Company's subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. which comprises the fair value of JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. all the intermediate holding companies and the PPP investments.
Fair value of the PPP investments is calculated by discounting at an appropriate discount rate future cash ows expected to be received by the group intermediate holdings, from investments in both equity dividends and equity redemptions and subordinated loans interest and repayments.
The basis of discount rates are long run average government bond rates adjusted for an appropriate premium to reect PPP specic risk.
Risk premia are then added to this adjusted base gilt rate depending on the phase of the project.
The discount rates that have been applied to the PPP investments at 31 December 2014 were in the range 7.40% to 8.54% 31 December 2013 7.50% to 8.85% which are relevant and in the range of those applied in the market for similar PPP investments.
Refer to note 10 for details of the areas of estimation in the calculation of the fair value.
i Segmental reporting In the financial statements, the Company recognises one investment into its 100% owned subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. The Board of Directors considers and analyses the performance of the Company by considering the Groups main activity which is to invest into PPP investments through its intermediate holding companies.
Information reported to the Companys Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on the sector risk associated within the Group.
The Group has investments in the Health, Education, Justice & Emergency Services, Transport, Regeneration & Social Housing, Government Buildings and Street Lighting sectors and therefore these form the Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8. j Statement of compliance Pursuant to the Protection of Investors Bailiwick of Guernsey Law, 1987 the Company is an Authorised Closed-Ended Investment Scheme.
As an authorised scheme, the Company is subject to certain ongoing obligations.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2014 3.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS In the application of the Companys accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the fair value of assets and liabilities that affect reported amounts.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss Fair value of intermediate holdings companies The Directors consider that the carrying value of the financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements are approximately equal to their fair value.
Fair value of PPP investments Fair values for those investments for which a market quote is not available are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash ows at the appropriate rate.
In determining the discount rate, regard is had to risk free rates, specic risks and the evidence of recent transactions.
Underlying assumptions and discount rates are disclosed in note 10.
The Directors have satisfied themselves that the PPP investments share the same investment characteristics and as such constitute a single asset class for IFRS 7 disclosure purposes.
OPERATING SEGMENTS Information reported to the Companys Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on the sector risk associated within the Group.
The Company has changed the structure of its internal organisation in a manner that causes the composition of its reportable segment to change to a sectorial split.
The change in internal organisation is due to experience gained in the past years and that different sectors have different amount of management time, required level of maintenance and generally different risk proles.
As such, and because the Fund has grown, the Board now receives the Portfolio Valuation analysis by sector and the Directors, Investment Advisers and Asset Management teams monitor the business in those lines.
Currently the Company, via its 100% owned subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. has investments in Health, Education, Justice & Emergency Services, Transport, Regeneration & Social Housing, Government Buildings and Street Lighting sectors and therefore these form the Companys reportable segments under IFRS 8.

Investments in PPP projects are valued using a discounted cash ow methodology.
The valuation techniques and methodologies have been applied consistently with the methodology used to value the Portfolio since launch in 2010.
Discount rates applied range from 7.40% to 8.54% weighted average 7.94% 2013 7.50% to 8.85% weighted average 8.18%.
The following economic assumptions were used in the discounted cash ow valuations: 2014 2013 Ination rates UK 2.75% 2.75% Canada 2.10% 2.10% Netherlands 1.90% 1.90% Finland 3% MAKU and 2.5% ELSPOT 3% MAKU and 2.5% ELSPOT Deposit interest rates UK 1% for 2015 rising to 3.5% from 2018 1% for 2015, rising to 3.5% from 2018 The prevailing Sterling exchange rate at 31 December was: 2014 2013 Canadian dollar 1.8054 1.7585 Euro 1.2808 1.1991 01 Overview 02 Strategic Report 03 Corporate Governance 04 Financial Statements 05 Additional Information Annual Report 2014 65.

The fair value of the Canadian and European investments include assumed tax payments at the appropriate local rates.
The fair value of the PPP investments would be an estimated 75.6 million higher or 65.6 million lower 2013 estimated 70.8 million higher or 61.2 million lower if the discount rate used in the discounted cash ow analysis were to differ by 1% from that used in the fair value calculation.
The weighted average discount rate for the PPP portfolio as at 31 December 2014 was 7.94% 2013 8.18%.
The fair value of the PPP investments would be an estimated 33.0 million higher 2013 34.0 million higher if the ination rate used in the discounted cash ow analysis was an absolute 1% higher than that used in the fair value calculation, and 30.8 million lower 2013 30.5 million lower if the ination rate was an absolute 1% lower.
The ination rate assumed for all future periods from 31 December 2014 was 2.75% 2013 2.75% for all UK projects, 2.1% 2013 2.1% for Canadian projects, for the Finnish project a rate of 3.0% 2013 3.0% was assumed for the MAKU index Finnish construction price index and a rate of 2.5% 2013 2.5% was assumed for the Elspot index Finnish utilities price index and for the Dutch project a CPI index of 1.9% 2013 1.9% was assumed.
The fair value of the PPP investments would be an estimated 6.3 million higher or 5.7 million lower 2013 estimated 6.3 million higher or 5.7 million lower if the exchange rates used in the discounted cash ow analysis were to differ by 5% from that used in the fair value calculation.
The fair value of the PPP investments would be an estimated 17.8 million higher or 17.6 million lower 2013 estimated 16.7 million higher or 16.2 million lower if the deposit rates used in the discounted cash ow analysis were to differ by 1% from that used in the fair value calculation.
The deposit rates assumed for all future periods from 31 December 2014 were 1% for 2015, gradually rising to 3.5% from 2018 for all projects except for the Canadian projects where the deposit rates assumed were 2.5% in 2015, rising to 3% from 2016 and the Finnish and Dutch projects where the deposit rates assumed were 1% in 2015, gradually rising to 2.5% from 2017.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2014 18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and ination risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and capital risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group and its investment entities use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
For the Company and the intermediate holding companies, financial risks are managed by the Investment Adviser who operate within the Board approved policies.
For the PPP investments, due to the nature of the investments, certain financial risks typically interest rate and ination risks are hedged at the inception of a project.
The various types of financial risk are managed as follows: Financial risk management Company only The Company accounts for its investments in its subsidiaries at fair value.
Accordingly, to the extent there are changes as a result of the risks set out below, these impact the fair value of the Companys investments.
Capital risk The Company has implemented an efficient nancing structure that enables it to manage its capital effectively.
The Companys capital structure comprises its equity only refer to the Statement of Changes in Equity.
As at 31 December 2014 the Company had no debt 2013 nil.
Liquidity risk The Directors monitor the Companys liquidity requirements to ensure there is sufficient cash to meet the Companys operating needs.
The Company adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by maintaining sufficient cash and available committed facilities to meet its obligations.
Due to the nature of its investments the timing of cash outows is reasonably predictable and, therefore, is not a major risk to the Company.
The Companys liquidity management policy involves projecting cash ows and forecasting the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
The Company was in a net cash position and had no outstanding debt at the balance sheet date.
Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company accounts for its investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. at fair value in Pounds Sterling.
The Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l and its subsidiaries have a small portion of their expenses and net assets denominated in Euro.
The Company considers that the currency exposure is minimal and as such does not require currency hedging.
Financial risk management Company and subsidiaries The following risks impact the Companys subsidiaries and in turn may impact the fair value of investments held by the Company.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by ensuring it maintains adequate cash and available banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity proles of the financial assets and liabilities.
Due to the nature of its investments PPP projects the timing of cash outows is reasonably predictable and, therefore, is not a major risk to the Group.
The Groups liquidity management policy involves projecting cash ows in major currencies and assuming the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty of the Company, its intermediate holding companies or its PPP project companies will default on the contractual obligations they entered into.
Credit risk is subsumed within the overall Companys performance risk.
The Company, its 100% owned immediate subsidiary and the intermediate holding companies rely on the performance of their main counterparties where credit risk arises, mainly from the Group's investments in PPP projects.
The performance risk arises from the PPP investments inability to pay the forecast distributions as the Group relies on its PPP investments projects companies to perform adequately and return the expected yields.
Several factors could hinder this ability such as poor operational performance, exceptional expenditures, major maintenance overspend or an event that would affect the PPP project companys cover ratios.
The Group's PPP investments are also dependant on the performance of their main operational contractors.
The Group regularly monitors the contractors' concentration and financial strength.
01 Overview 02 Strategic Report 03 Corporate Governance 04 Financial Statements 05 Additional Information Annual Report 2014 71.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Financial risk management Company and subsidiaries continued The Directors and Investment Adviser regularly assess the returns forecast from PPP investments through the update of cash ow forecasts and by monitoring the operational and financial performance of these investments with regular performance meetings.
The Group's PPP investments' project companies receive regular, long term, index linked revenue from government departments, public sector or local authority clients or directly from the public via real tolls, providing a stable and low risk income stream.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
The Group mitigates its risk on cash investments and derivative transactions by only transacting with banking counterparties with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies a minimum of Standard and Poors A-1.
The Directors believe that the Group is not signicantly exposed to credit risk and that its investments' underlying risks are monitored and sufciently mitigated for the investments to deliver the expected return to the Group.
The Board have considered the above factors and the discount rate sensitivities disclosed in note 10 and does not consider it appropriate to present a detailed analysis of credit risk.
Market risk ination risk Each of the Groups PPP asset investments will typically have part of its revenue and some of its costs linked to a specic ination index at inception of the project.
In most cases this creates a natural hedge, meaning a derivative does not need to be entered into in order to mitigate ination risk.
However, in a minority of cases where the investment has index-linked cash ows that fall outside of this natural hedge, the ination risk is hedged using RPI ination swaps.
For a sensitivity analysis of investments at fair value through profit or loss, refer to note 10.
Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company has one investment in its direct subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. which has exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through holding Euro cash balances and contracting with service providers paid in Euro.
The level of these balances and expenditures are marginal and do not pose a significant risk to the value recognised in the Companys balance sheet.
As at 31 December 2014 the fair value of the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. includes six 2013 five overseas investments.
The Company and its subsidiaries foreign currency exchange rate risk policy is not to automatically hedge on an individual project basis but to determine the total Group exposure to individual currencies.
At 31 December 2014 the Companys investment at fair value through profit or loss in the balance sheet includes the fair value of four foreign exchange forward contracts of 27,000 31 December 2013 restated 523,000, three in Canadian Dollar currency and one in Euro which are entered into by one of the Companys indirect intermediate holding companies.
The Company and its subsidiaries are mainly exposed to uctuations in the Euro and Canadian dollar exchange rates.

The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items fair valued within the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and reects a 5% change in foreign currency exchange rates.
A negative number below indicates a decrease in profit from operations where the relevant currency weakens by 5% against Sterling.
For a 5% strengthening of the relevant currency against Sterling, there would be an equal and opposite impact on profit from operations, and the negative balances below would be positive.

Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to variability of interest payment cash ows.
Each PPP investment hedges its interest rate risk at the inception of a project.
This will either be done by issuing a xed rate bond or, if the project is bank nanced, with xed rate bank debt or variable rate debt which will be swapped into xed rate by the use of interest rate swaps.
The uctuations in interest rates impact the return from oating rate deposits and hence the income from investments at fair value through profit or loss.
A 1% increase or decrease represents the Boards assessment of the reasonable possible change in interest rates.
The Group was in a net cash position and had no outstanding debt at 31 December 2014.
The interest rate sensitivity of the Groups assets and liabilities had nil impact.
The Company held the following financial instruments at fair value at 31 December 2014.
There have been no transfers of financial instruments between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.

There were no Level 1 assets or liabilities during the year 2013 none.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2, Level 1 and 3 or Level 2 and 3 during the year 2013 none.
In the table above, financial instruments are held at carrying value as an approximation to fair value unless stated otherwise.
Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities An analysis of the movement between opening to closing balances of the investments at fair value through profit or loss is given in note 10.
The investments at fair value through profit or loss, whose fair values include the use of Level 3 inputs, include the fair value of the Companys 100% owned subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. the intermediate holding companies and the Group's PPP investments.
The fair value of the companys direct subsidiary and the intermediate holding companies mainly comprises cash and working capital balances.
The fair value of these companies are equivalent to their Net Assets.
The Groups PPP investments are valued by discounting future cash ows from investments in both equity dividends and equity redemptions and subordinated loans interest and repayments to the Group at an appropriate discount rate.
The basis of each discount rate, which is a weighted average cost of capital, is a long run average government bond rates adjusted by an appropriate premium to reect PPP specic risk, phase of the PPP project and counterparty credit risk.
The weighted average discount rate applied was 7.94% year ended 31 December 2013 8.18%.
The discount rate is considered the most significant unobservable input through which an increase or decrease would have a material impact on the fair value of the investments at fair value through profit or loss.
An increase in 1% in the discount rate would cause a decrease in fair value of the PPP investments of 65.6 million year ended 31 December 2013 61.2 million.
The remaining investments at fair value through profit or loss is composed of the fair value of the intermediate holding companies which mainly comprises cash and working capital balances.
For a sensitivity analysis of Financial Assets at fair value through profit or loss, refer to note 10.
The Directors consider that the carrying value amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements are approximately equal to their fair values.
