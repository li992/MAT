Other intangible assets arising on acquisition represent customer relationships, customer contracts at the date of acquisition, patents and trade names.
In 2014, for impairment testing purposes goodwill has been allocated to 16 separate cash-generating units CGUs.
Of these, the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to four individual CGUs Keller Canada, Suncoast, HJ Foundations and Keller Limited is significant in comparison to the total carrying amount of goodwill and comprises 76% of the total.
The carrying amounts allocated to three further CGUs, taken together, comprise a further 15% of the total.
The relevant CGUs and the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to each are as set out below, together with the pre-tax discount rate and medium-term growth rate used in their value in use calculations: 2014 2014 2014 2013 2013 2013 Carrying Pre-tax Forecast Carrying Pre-tax Forecast value discount rate growth rate value discount rate growth rate Cash-generating unit Geographical segment m % % m % % Keller Canada North America 64.9 11.3 2.0 66.8 11.5 2.0 Suncoast North America 27.7 13.4 3.0 26.1 13.0 3.0 HJ Foundations North America 17.9 16.0 3.0 16.8 16.9 3.0 Keller Limited EMEA 12.1 12.4 2.0 12.1 13.0 2.0 Hayward Baker North America 9.0 16.7 3.0 8.4 16.3 3.0 Resource Piling Asia 7.9 11.9 2.0 7.7 11.8 2.0 Waterway Australia 7.4 15.7 1.0 7.5 16.2 1.0 Other Various 13.6 11.1 160.5 156.5 The recoverable amount of the goodwill allocated to each CGU has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The calculations all use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a five-year period.
The Groups businesses operate in cyclical markets, some of which are expected to continue to face uncertain conditions over the next couple of years.
The most important factors in the value in use calculations, however, are the forecast revenues and operating margins during the forecast period and the discount rates applied to future cash flows.
The key assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts are therefore the revenue and operating margins assumed throughout the forecast period.
The discount rates used in the value in use calculations are based on the weighted average cost of capital of companies comparable to the relevant CGUs, adjusted as necessary to reflect the risk associated with the asset being tested.
Management considers all the forecast revenues, margins and profits to be reasonably achievable given recent performance and the historic trading results of the relevant CGUs.
Cash flows beyond 2019 have been extrapolated using a steady growth rate of between 1% and 3% shown in the table above, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which the relevant CGUs operate.
80 Keller Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements 13 Intangible assets continued Management believes that, with the exception of Keller Limited UK and Keller Canada Canada, any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amounts of the CGUs identified above are based would not cause any of their carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.
Keller Limited UK Although revenues are forecast to reduce in 2015 as two significant contracts were substantially completed during 2014, the assumptions underlying the forecasts in subsequent years are for a gradual recovery to more normal, mid-cycle, market conditions by 2019.
Clearly, in the event that this assumption proves over optimistic and the UK construction market experiences a prolonged depression, such that demand for our products is materially below long-term historic levels, this would adversely impact the forecast cash flows and may lead to an impairment of goodwill.
Based on the value in use calculation, the recoverable amount of Keller Limited exceeds the carrying amount by 11.5m.
In order for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying amount, forecast revenue growth in each year, at the assumed operating margins, would have to decrease by 6.3%, which would result in a negative 2.6% compound annual growth rate over the period from 2015 to 2019.
Alternatively, assumed operating margins in each year would have to decrease by 1.5%.
Keller Canada Canada The 2014 results of Keller Canada are below those expected at the time of acquisition, primarily due to worsening market conditions.
The assumptions underlying the forecasts in subsequent years are for a recovery in the Canadian market in the medium term.
Clearly, in the event that this assumption proves over optimistic and the Canadian market experiences a prolonged depression such that demand for our products is materially below long-term historic levels, this would adversely impact the forecast cash flows and may lead to an impairment of goodwill.
Based on the value in use calculation, the recoverable amount of Keller Canada exceeds the carrying amount by C$71.2m 39.3m.
In order for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying amount, forecast revenue growth in each year, at the assumed operating margins, would have to decrease by 5.1%, which would result in a 3.2% compound annual growth rate over the period from 2015 to 2019.
Alternatively, assumed operating margins in each year would have to decrease by 2.5%.

Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values.
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Derivatives The fair value of interest rate and cross-currency swaps is calculated based on expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
In 2014 and in 2013, the valuation methods of all of the Groups derivative financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised as Level 2.
Level 2 is defined as inputs, other than quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Keller Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 85 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Financial instruments continued Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Contingent consideration Fair value is calculated based on the amounts expected to be paid, determined by reference to forecasts of future performance of the acquired businesses discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and the probability of contingent events and targets being achieved.
In 2014 and in 2013, the valuation methods of all of the Groups contingent consideration carried at fair value are categorised as Level 3.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Groups contingent consideration are forecast revenue growth rates 2014: 1%10%, forecast EBITDA margins 2014: 9%14% and pre-tax discount rates 2014: 17%22%.
The following table shows a reconciliation from the opening to closing balances for Level 3 fair values: Contingent consideration m At 1 January 2014 8.5 Provision released Note 7 7.5 Additional amounts provided 0.9 Assumed within business combinations Note 4 0.9 Unwind of contingent consideration Note 7 0.2 1 Exchange differences 0.2 At 31 December 2014 2.8 1 Included in other comprehensive income.
The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration could be affected if the forecast revenue growth rates or forecast EBITDA margins are different to those stated above.
A higher forecast revenue growth rate or higher EBITDA margin may increase the value of the contingent consideration payable.

The Scheme can invest in a wide range of asset classes including equities, bonds, cash, property, alternatives including private equity, commodities, hedge funds, infrastructure, currency, high yield debt and derivatives and annuity policies.
