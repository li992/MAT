On 31st May 2011, we filed a claim with the Authority for Advance Rulings to seek to confirm that Serco was not required to withhold Indian income tax from the purchase price on the acquisition of Intelenet.
The AAR declined to rule on the matter, so Serco filed a claim with the High Court to decide on the matter or direct the AAR to rule on the matter.
The High Court has currently reserved judgment.
Should the matter be decided against Serco, it would be liable for unprovided tax of 27m together with accrued interest to 31 December 2014 of 11m.
Having taken appropriate professional advice, Serco considers it likely that it will ultimately be successful in this matter.
In December 2013, following a review of billing arrangements on the EM contract by the Ministry of Justice, a settlement of 64.3m was reached in respect of contractual claims.
In addition, a 2.0m settlement was reached on the Prisoner Escort and Custody Services PECS contract which was also subject to Government review to reflect repayment of past profits earned on this contract.
The settlement was full and final in respect of contractual claims with the proviso that additional payments might be sought in limited circumstances, such as if criminality was to be established.
Serco continues to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigations by the Serious Fraud Office.
Financial Risk Management 33. a Fair Value of Financial Instruments i Hierarchy of fair value The classification of the fair value measurement falls into three levels, based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The levels are as follows: Level 1: inputs derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly : and Level 3: inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Based on the above, the derivative financial instruments held by the Group at 31 December 2014 and the comparison fair values for loans and finance leases, are all considered to fall into Level 2.
There have been no transfers between levels in the year.
