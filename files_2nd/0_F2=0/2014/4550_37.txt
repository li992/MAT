126 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Accounting Policies Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2014 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries.
a Statement of Compliance These consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP and they are separately presented on pages 170 to 178. b Basis of Preparation The Groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 6 to 61.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Refer to the Corporate Governance Report on page 75 for details.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
They are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except where International Financial Reporting Standards require an alternative treatment.
The principal variations relate to derivative financial instruments, cash settled share-based transactions and contingent consideration that are stated at fair value.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of accounting estimates and for management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
These judgements and estimates are based on historical experience and managements best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions under review and the actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
Areas involving a high degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are, where necessary, disclosed separately.
Discontinued Operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Classification of a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement is presented as if the operation had discontinued from the start of the comparative period.
The disposal of the Services Segment, as described in note 30, gives rise to a discontinued operation.
Critical Judgements in applying the Groups Accounting Policies and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the Directors have made the following judgements and estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty which may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are also discussed below.
i Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets The Group determines whether goodwill and indefinite life assets are impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which they are allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Further detail on the assumptions used in determining value in use calculations is provided in note 13. ii Valuation of Intangible Assets Product rights and customer relationships that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Fair value at the date of acquisition reflects managements judgement of the fair value of the individual intangible asset calculated by reference to the net present value of future benefits accruing to the Group from the utilisation of the asset, discounted at an appropriate discount rate.

Accounting Policies continued Adoption of New and Revised Standards The following standards and interpretations are applicable to the Group and have been adopted in the current period as they are mandatory for the year ended 30 June 2014.
Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits the amendments require immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income and eliminate the corridor method.
The principal amendment that has affected the Company is the requirement to calculate net interest income or expense using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation.
The adoption of this standard has no significant impact.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurements replaces existing guidance on fair value measurement in different IFRSs with a single definition of fair value, a framework for measuring fair values and disclosures about fair value measurements.
This standard applies to assets, liabilities and the Companys own equity instruments that, under other IFRSs, are required or permitted to be measured at fair value or when disclosure of fair value is provided.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
There are no other new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations mandatory for the first time for the year ended 30 June 2014.
New Standards and Interpretations not yet Adopted The following standards and interpretations have been published, endorsed by the EU, and are available for early adoption, but have not yet been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
IAS 27 Revised Separate Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
The Group does not anticipate that the adoption of the above amendments will have a material effect on its financial statements on initial adoption.

Accounting Policies continued c Basis of Consolidation Subsidiary Undertakings Subsidiary undertakings are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They cease to be consolidated from the date that the Group no longer has control.
All subsidiary undertakings have been consolidated.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
The financial statements of all subsidiary undertakings are prepared to the same reporting date as the Company.
During the 2013 financial year the reporting dates of the previously acquired Eurovet companies were brought in line with the Company.
d Foreign Currency Translation i Functional and Presentational Currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency and are rounded to the nearest thousand, except where it is deemed relevant to disclose the amounts to the nearest pound.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
ii Foreign Currency Translation Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to effective cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
iii Foreign Operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Sterling at the closing rate at the reporting date.
The income and expenses are translated to Sterling at the average rate for the period being reported.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the foreign currency translation reserve, a separate component of equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
On disposal of a foreign entity, accumulated exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.
e Accounting for Financial Assets, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities The Gr oup classifies its financial assets into the following categories: held for trading financial assets, and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial r ecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date for financial assets other than those held at fair value through the income statement.
Financial assets ar e derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Gains and losses both realised and unrealised arising from changes in the value of financial assets held at fair value through the income statement are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
The Gr oup assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2014 Our Financials 129 1.
Accounting Policies continued Held for Trading Financial Assets This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading and those designated at fair value thr ough the income statement at inception.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated by management.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are also categorised as held for trading.
Held for trading financial assets are recognised and subsequently carried at fair value.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Gr oup uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivatives ar e initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.
Cash Flow Hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges ar e recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expir es or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income remains there until the forecast transaction occurs.
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised.
In other cases, the amount recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Trade Receivables T rade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently stated at amortised cost less appropriate allowances for amounts which are expected to be non-recoverable.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement in operating expenses.
Trade and Other Payables T rade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowings and Borrowing Costs Borr owings are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borr owings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
Borr owing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.

Accounting Policies continued f Property, Plant and Equipment Owned Assets Items of pr operty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy j.
Leased Assets Leases under the terms of which the Gr oup assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets acquired by finance leases are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation Depr eciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the date the assets become available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: freehold buildings 25 years short leasehold buildings period of lease plant and fixtures 3 to 10 years motor vehicles 4 years The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
g Intangible Assets Goodwill All business combinations ar e accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 July 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Acquisitions after this date fall under the pr ovisions of Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2009.
For these acquisitions, transaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, are expensed as incurred and subsequent adjustments to the fair value of consideration payable are recognised in the income statement.
Contingent consideration is measur ed at fair value based on an estimate of the expected future payments.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually for impairment.

Accounting Policies continued Research and Development Costs Expenditur e on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense is incurred.
The Gr oup is also engaged in development activity with a view to bringing new pharmaceutical products to market.
Due to the strict regulatory process involved, there is inherent uncertainty as to the technical feasibility of development projects often until regulatory approval is achieved, with the possibility of failure even at a late stage.
The Group considers that this uncertainty means that the criteria for capitalisation are not met unless it is highly probable that regulatory approval will be achieved and the project is commercially viable.
Internally generated costs of development are capitalised, once the criteria are met, in the consolidated statement of financial position unless those costs cannot be measured reliably or it is not probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group, in which case the relevant costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
Wher e development costs are capitalised, the expenditure includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditur e is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Acquired Intangible Assets Intangible assets r ecognised as a result of a business combination are stated at fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets that ar e acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and other intangibles is recognised in the income statement as an expense is incurred.
Subsequent Expenditure Subsequent expenditur e on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each consolidated statement of financial position date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date that they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: software 5 to 7 years capitalised development costs 5 to 10 years or period of patent patent rights period of patent marketing authorisations indefinite life product rights 10 to 15 years customer relationships 10 years h Inventories Inventories ar e stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditur e incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.

Accounting Policies continued i Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank over drafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
j Impairment The carrying amounts of the Gr oups assets are reviewed at each consolidated statement of financial position date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The r ecoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that ar e not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each consolidated statement of financial position date and when there is an indication that the asset is impaired.
An impairment loss is r ecognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses r ecognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units group of units, and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the units group of units on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss in r espect of goodwill is not reversed.
In r espect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is r eversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
k Dividends Dividends ar e recognised in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders or, in the case of an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.
l Employee Benefits Pensions The Gr oup operates a stakeholder personal pension scheme for certain employees.
Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Dechra V eterinary Products SAS and Dechra Veterinary Products BV participate in state-run pension arrangements.
These are not considered to be material to the Group financial statements and are accounted for as defined contribution schemes, with contributions being recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
The Gr oup sponsors defined benefit arrangements in certain countries, the most material being a defined benefit pension plan in the Netherlands.
This is a funded career average pay arrangement, where pensionable salary is subject to a cap.
The arrangement is financed through an insurance contract.
Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2014 Our Financials 133 1.
Accounting Policies continued The Gr oups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its pr esent value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The liability discount rate is the yield at the Statement of Financial Position date using AA rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Gr oups obligation in respect of a scheme are recognised immediately in reserves and reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Share-based Payment Transactions The Gr oup operates a number of equity settled share-based payment programmes that allow employees to acquire shares in the Company.
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Plan for Directors and Senior Executives.
The fair value of shar es or options granted is recognised as an employee expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis in the income statement with a corresponding movement to equity reserves.
Fair values are determined by use of an appropriate pricing model and are determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each consolidated statement of financial position date, the Gr oup revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
The impact of the revisions of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves, over the remaining vesting period.
The fair values of grants under the Long T erm Incentive Plan have been determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as performed by a qualified third party valuation expert.
The fair values of options granted under all other shar e option schemes have been determined using the BlackScholes option pricing model, as performed by a qualified third party valuation expert.
National Insurance contributions payable by the Company on the intrinsic value of shar e-based payments at the date of exercise are treated as cash settled awards and revalued to market price at each consolidated statement of financial position date.
m Revenue Recognition Revenue is r ecognised in the income statement when goods are supplied to external customers against orders, title and risk of loss are passed to the customer, reliable estimates can be made of relevant deductions and all relevant obligations have been fulfilled, such that the earnings process is regarded as being complete.
Revenue represents net invoice value after the deduction of discounts and allowances given and accruals for estimated future rebates and returns.
The methodology and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are monitored and adjusted regularly in the light of contractual and legal obligations, historical trends, past experience and projected market conditions.
Market conditions are evaluated using wholesaler and other third party analysis, and internally generated information.
Value added tax and other sales taxes are excluded from revenue.

Accounting Policies continued n Leases Operating Leases Payments made under operating leases ar e recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement evenly over the period of the lease, as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Finance Leases Minimum lease payments ar e apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability using the effective interest rate method.
o Net Financing Costs Net financing costs comprise inter est payable on borrowings, unwinding of discount on provisions, interest receivable on funds invested, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement see accounting policy e and gains or losses on the retranslation of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues.
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
p Basis of Charge for Taxation Income tax expense comprises curr ent and deferred tax.
Current and deferred taxes are recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Curr ent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the consolidated statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferr ed tax is provided using the consolidated statement of financial position liability method and represents the tax payable or recoverable on most temporary differences which arise between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes the tax base.
Temporary differences are not provided on: goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and do not arise from a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, and is based upon tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the consolidated statement of financial position date.
A deferr ed tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is not probable that the related tax benefit will be realised against future taxable profits.
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each consolidated statement of financial position date.
Curr ent and deferred tax credits received in respect of share-based payments are recognised in the Income Statement to the extent that they do not exceed the standard rate of taxation on the Income Statement charge for share-based payments.
Credits in excess of the standard rate of taxation are recognised directly in equity.

Accounting Policies continued q Earnings per Share The Gr oup presents basic and diluted earnings per share EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the effects of all potential dilutive ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to employees.
The Gr oup has also chosen to present an alternative EPS measure, with profit adjusted for non-underlying items.
A reconciliation of this alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRSs is given in notes 4 and 5.
Operating Segments The Group has three reportable segments four including the divested Services Segment, as discussed below, which are based on information provided to the Board of Directors, which is deemed to be the Groups chief operating decision maker.

The principal assets within acquired intangibles are the development costs and product rights recognised on the acquisitions of Dechra Veterinary Products Holding A S, DermaPet Inc. Genitrix Limited and Eurovet Animal Health B. V. The carrying value of these assets at 30 June 2014 was 114.7 million with a remaining amortisation period of 3 years, 11 years, 6 years and 8 years respectively.
The other significant assets within acquired intangibles are the product rights recognised on the acquisition of Pharmaderm Animal Health and HY-50.
The carrying value at 30 June 2014 was 1.3 million and 3.9 million with a remaining amortisation period of 9 years and 7 years respectively.
In May 2014, the Company completed the purchase of product rights to Phycox, a patented nutraceutical which competes in the US veterinary joint health supplement market, as well as a new product in the final phase of development.
The carrying value of these assets at 30 June 2014 is 7.4 million, with a remaining amortisation period of 10 years.
During the prior year the Company completed a licensing, supply and distribution agreement for a branded veterinary generic pharmaceutical product from a US pharmaceutical development company.
Under the terms of the agreement Dechra paid US$1.5 million upon signing and will pay a further US$1.5 million on approval.
There is a potential further contingent payment of US$2.0 million based on achieving US$20.0 million cumulative sales.
The principal asset within patent rights comprises payments to acquire the right to develop and market Trilostane, the active ingredient of Vetoryl Capsules, for animal health applications in the USA and Canada.
The carrying value at 30 June 2014 was 1.0 million with a remaining amortisation period of 4 years.
The rights to Equidone, which was launched in the US during 2011, has a carrying value of 0.8 million with an amortisation period of 7 years.
822,000 of the marketing authorisations relate to the Vetivex range of products.
The Vetivex marketing authorisations are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives and have not been amortised.
Ownership of the marketing authorisations rests with the Group in perpetuity.
There are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit their useful lives.
Vetivex is an established range of products which are relatively simple in nature and there are a limited number of players in the market.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate that the marketing authorisations are treated as having indefinite lives for accounting purposes.

Impairment Reviews Goodwill, indefinite life assets and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that amounts might be impaired.
Acquired intangible assets that are being amortised are effectively tested for impairment by virtue of their inclusion in the carrying value of the cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated.
The impairment test involves determining the recoverable amount of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, which corresponds to the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or its value in use.
Value in use calculations are performed by forecasting the future cash flows attributable to the asset being tested or the relevant cash generating unit in respect of goodwill.
The forecast cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate as described below.
Projected future cash flows have been derived from the business plan and extrapolated by applying a growth rate of 3% 2013: 3% per annum up to year five and thereafter a growth rate of 0% 2013: 0% per annum into perpetuity which is considered to be conservative compared to the long term average growth rate for the industry.
The business plan has been formulated based on various factors, including market growth forecasts, the competitive and legislative environments and existing product growth.
These factors reflect past experience of the Group and, where applicable, are consistent with external sources of information.
The pre-tax discount rates have been estimated using a market participant rate, which is adjusted for consideration of market information, and risk adjusted dependent upon the specific circumstances of each asset or cash generating unit.
Value in use calculations were performed at 30 June 2014 for the following assets: 2014 Indefinite Goodwill life assets Pre-tax carrying carrying Total discount value value value rate Cash generating unit 000 000 000 % Dechra Veterinary Products EU 52,368 822 53,190 11.4 Dechra Veterinary Products US 379 379 12.2 Dechra Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Skipton 2,231 2,231 11.3 54,978 822 55,800 2013 Indefinite Goodwill life assets Pre-tax carrying carrying Total discount value value value rate Cash generating unit 000 000 000 % Dechra Veterinary Products EU 55,794 822 56,616 8.8 Dechra Veterinary Products US 330 330 10.4 Dechra Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Skipton 2,231 2,231 8.7 58,355 822 59,177 In all cases there was significant headroom between the carrying value and the value in use and no impairment provision is therefore required.
An increase in the pre-tax discount rate of 1% and a reduction in the growth rate to nil would still not result in the requirement for an impairment provision.

In September 2013, the proceeds from the divestment of the Services Segment were used to pay down the term loan in full and partly pay down the revolving credit facility.
This gave rise to a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1,213,000.
Resetting of foreign currency borrowings within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows relates to the cash adjustment required to ensure the movements in foreign exchange rates do not result in the committed revolving credit facility being exceeded.
In September 2014, the Group refinanced its existing bank facility, which will give rise to a loss on extinguishment of debt of 386,000 in the year ending 30 June 2015.
The Groups revised borrowing facility comprises a 90.0 million revolving credit facility and a 30.0 million Accordion facility committed until September 2019 and various finance lease obligations.
At the year end, the Group had the following unutilised borrowing facilities: 2014 2013 000 000 Bank overdraft facility 10,000 The current revolving credit facility is secured by a fixed and floating charge on the assets of the Group.
Interest is charged at 2.50% over LIBOR or the applicable base rate.
All covenants were met during the year ended 30 June 2014.
The revised borrowing facility is not secured on any assets of the Group but is supported by a joint and several crossguarantee structure.
Interest will be charged at 1.30% over LIBOR.

Employee Benefit Obligations The Group sponsors defined benefit arrangements in certain countries, the most material being a defined benefit pension plan in the Netherlands.
The other defined benefit pension arrangements operated by the Company are unfunded: Jubilee awards of 182,000 2013: 98,000 for employees in the Netherlands are recognised within other payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2014.
The pension cost relating to the defined benefit pension arrangement in the Netherlands is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The major actuarial assumptions used by the actuary were: 2014 2013 Discount rate 3.40% 3.90% Inflation assumption 1.80% 1.90% Salary growth 2.30% 2.40% Rate of increase in accrued pensions of active members 1.20% 1.30% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 0.00% 0.00% Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 0.00% 0.00% Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2014 Our Financials 151 21.
Employee Benefit Obligations continued In valuing the liabilities of the pension scheme at 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2013, mortality assumptions have been made as indicated below.
The mortality assumption follows the AG Prognosetafel 2012-2062 mortality tables with an experience adjustment in line with the ES-P2 tables as published by the Dutch Alliance of Insurers.
The assumptions used by the Group are the best estimates chosen by the Directors from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

Under this contract, a market price for the assets in respect of this insurance contract is not available.
In accordance with IAS 19 for such insurance policies, an asset value has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows.
The discount rate used for this calculation reflects the risk associated with the scheme assets and the maturity or expected disposal date of those assets.
The fair value of the schemes assets is as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Discount rate used to value assets 3.40% 3.90% Total fair value of assets 4,857 3,726 Actual return on scheme assets 159 123 The long term rate of return on pension plan assets is determined by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the strategic asset allocation as at the year end.
This rate of return is then adjusted for any expected profit sharing based on market related returns on notional loans.
The schemes assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments or any property occupied by or other assets used by the Group.
The employer has a contract with the insurance company  to cover the committed pension benefits.
The employer contributions expected to be paid into the scheme for the next financial period amount to 694,000 2013: 571,000.

The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and the Groups treasury policy specifically prohibits such activity.
All transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities, not for speculation.
Capital Management The capital structure of the Group consists of net borrowings and shareholders equity.
At 30 June 2014, net borrowings were 5.0 million 2013: 80.8 million, whilst shareholders equity was 204.8 million 2013: 174.6 million.
The Group maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain investors, creditors and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Group manages its capital structure to maintain a prudent balance between debt and equity that allows sufficient headroom to finance the Groups product development programme and appropriate acquisitions.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
The Group operates globally, primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which the Group trades.
The Groups operating subsidiaries are generally cash generative and none are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
There are financial covenants associated with the Groups borrowings which are cash flow cover, interest cover, net debt to EBITDA and consolidated net worth.
The Group comfortably complied with these covenants in 2014 and 2013.
Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in the development of new products as well as to make the routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt.
The Groups policy is to maintain borrowing facilities centrally which are then used to finance the Groups operating subsidiaries, either by way of equity investments or loans.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Financial Risk Management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: liquidity risk market risk credit risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet liabilities as they fall due.
Cash flows and covenants of the Group are monitored quarterly.
These are reviewed to ensure sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12 month period.
The Group manages its funding requirements through the following lines of credit: 65.0 million revolving credit facility, of which 32.0 million was drawn down at 30 June 2014: and various finance leases The Groups undrawn borrowing facilities at 30 June 2014 and details of its revised facility are detailed in note 20.
Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates or interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
Interest Rate Risk Management The majority of the Groups borrowings bear interest at floating rates linked to base rate or LIBOR and are consequently exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group has hedged interest rate risk on a proportion of its revolving credit facility by means of an interest rate swap arrangement whereby the Groups exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR is fixed at a rate of 0.85% on the revolving credit facility.
The amount of the revolving credit outstanding at 30 June 2014 was 32.0 million 2013: 115.1 million.
The hedge is in place until 31 October 2016 and the amount hedged matches the repayment profile of the facility.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management Foreign currency transaction exposure arising on normal trade flows is not hedged.
The Group matches receipts and payments in the relevant foreign currencies as far as possible.
To this end, bank accounts are maintained for all the major currencies in which the Group trades.
Translational exposure in converting the income statements of foreign subsidiaries into the Groups presentational currency of Sterling is not hedged.
The Group hedges selectively expected currency cash flows outside normal trading activities, principally using foreign currency options.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 55,955,000 2013: 59,009,000 which is the total carrying value of the Groups financial assets.
Cash is only deposited with highly rated banks in line with our treasury policy.
The Group offers trade credit to customers in the normal course of business.
Trade and bank references are obtained prior to extending credit.
The financial statements of corporate customers are monitored on a regular basis.
The principal customers of the Pharmaceuticals Segments are European and US wholesalers.
The failure of a large wholesaler could have a material adverse impact on the Groups financial results.
The largest customer of the Group excluding assets relating to discontinued operations accounted for approximately 8.4% of gross trade receivables at 30 June 2014 2013: 2.0%.
No customer accounted for more than 10% of total Group revenues.
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers the debt to be no longer recoverable.
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following table presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2013.
The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and cash equivalents approximates to the carrying amount.
Forward exchange contracts based on market price and exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps based upon the amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the instrument at the balance sheet date, being the market price of the instrument.
Receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount.
Bank loans and overdrafts based upon discounted cash flows using discount rates based upon facility rates renegotiated after the 30 June 2014 year end.
Finance lease obligations based upon discounted cash flows using discount rates based upon the Groups cost of borrowing at the balance sheet date.

The outputs from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of the effect of changes in market risks assuming that the specified changes occur at the year end and are applied to the risk exposures at that date.
Accordingly they show the impact on the balance sheet of an instantaneous shock.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to commercial actions taken to mitigate any potential losses from such rate movements, to the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring and to further developments in global financial markets.
As such this table should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses.
Hedges Cash Flow Hedges The Group has entered into an interest rate swap on the revolving credit facility of 32.0 million.
The Group has designated this a cash flow hedge.
The risk being hedged is the variability of cash flows arising from movements in interest rates.
No ineffectiveness arose on the hedge.
The hedge is in place until 31 October 2016.
The amounts recognised in equity are recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement to offset gains and losses in the period in which the cash flows occur.

For the options to vest, there must be an increase in earnings per share of at least 12% above the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI over a three year period.
Once vested, options must be exercised within ten years of the date of grant.
Long Term Incentive Plan For Awards granted before 5 March 2013: Vesting is dependent on an underpin condition based on the Companys adjusted diluted earnings per share performance.
No Awards will vest unless adjusted diluted earnings per share has grown by at least 3% per annum above the retail prices index over the three year measurement period.
Provided this condition is met, then the number of shares that vest depends on the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE Small Cap Index over the three year measurement period.
100% of the shares vest if the Company achieves an upper quartile performance, 25% of the shares vest at median performance, and awards vest on a straight-line basis for performance in between.
No shares vest if performance is below median.
For Awards granted on and after 5 March 2013: Vesting is dependent on two performance conditions which must be satisfied over a three year performance period commencing from the start of the financial year within which the award is granted.
50% of the Award will vest dependent on the Companys TSR performance against an appropriate comparator group.
50% of the Award will vest subject to a performance condition based on the annual earnings per share growth.
Each of the TSR and EPS elements is subject to an additional ROCE underpin.
Unless the Companys ROCE is 10% or more in the final year of the performance period, the award will lapse in full.
SAYE Option Scheme This scheme is open to all UK employees.
Participants save a fixed amount of up to 250 per month for either three or five years and are then able to use these savings to buy shares in the Company at a price fixed at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period.

Acquisitions Acquisition of Phycox On 20 May 2014, the Group acquired certain trade and assets of PSPC Inc. for a maximum total consideration of US$14.2 million.
PSPCs principal product is Phycox, a patented nutraceutical which competes in the US veterinary joint health supplement market.
Additionally, a new product is in the final phase of development.
The acquisition enhances our US product portfolio and adds further critical mass to our US business.
US$8.5 million of the consideration was payable on completion, US$1.5 million was contingent upon the successful registration of the new product, which occurred in June 2014, and US$4.2 million is contingent on future sales.

The goodwill of 84,000 arising from the acquisition consists of the assembled workforce and technical expertise.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Acquisition related costs included in operating expenses amounted to 150,000.
Phycoxs results are reported within the US Pharmaceuticals Segment.
Contingent consideration of US$1.5 million was paid on 20 June 2014 following the successful registration of the new product.
The remaining contingent consideration of US$4.2 million 2.5 million represents royalties payable of 10% of future global net sales with a further 2.5% payable on sales over US$7.5 million, and a further 2.5% payable on sales over US$12.5 million.
Phycox contributed nil revenue and nil to the Groups underlying pre-tax profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
