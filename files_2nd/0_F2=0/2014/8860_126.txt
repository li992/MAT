14 Post-employment benefits 14a Group The group operates a number of post-employment retirement and medical benefit plans around the world, the forms of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The retirement plans in the UK, US and other countries include both defined contribution and defined benefit plans.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee and the investment returns on those contributions prior to retirement.
The group also makes payments to employees personal pension plans.
For defined benefit plans, which include final salary, career average and other types of plans with committed pension payments, the retirement benefits are based on factors such as the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
The majority of the groups final salary and career average defined benefit retirement plans are now closed to new entrants but remain open to ongoing accrual for current members.
The groups principal defined benefit retirement plans are funded through separate fiduciary or trustee administered funds that are independent of the sponsoring company.
The contributions paid to these arrangements are jointly agreed by the sponsoring company and the relevant trustee or fiduciary body after each funding valuation and in consultation with independent qualified actuaries.
The plans assets together with the agreed funding contributions should be sufficient to meet the plans future pension obligations.
The groups principal post-employment medical plans are in the UK and US and are unfunded arrangements that have been closed to new entrants for over 10 years.

Accounts Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2014 14 Post-employment benefits continued 14a Group continued Regulatory framework and governance The UK pension plan, the Johnson Matthey Employees Pension Scheme JMEPS, is a registered arrangement and established under trust law and, as such, is subject to UK pension, tax and trust legislation.
It is managed by a corporate trustee, JMEPS Trustees Limited.
The trustee board includes representatives appointed by both the parent company and employees and includes an independent chairman.
Although the parent company bears the financial cost of the plan, the trustee directors are responsible for the overall management and governance of JMEPS, including compliance with all applicable legislation and regulations.
The trustee directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and to set certain policies: to manage the day to day administration of the benefits: and to set the plans investment strategy following consultation with the parent company.
UK pensions are regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website: www.
The US pension plans are qualified pension arrangements and are subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Pension Protection Act 2006 and the Department of Labor and Internal Revenue.
The plans are managed by a pension committee which acts as the fiduciary and, as such, is ultimately responsible for the management of the plans investments: compliance with all applicable legislation and regulations: and overseeing the general management of the plans.
Other trustee or fiduciary arrangements that have similar responsibilities and obligations are in place for the groups other funded defined benefit pension plans outside of the UK and US.
Benefits The UK pension plan is segregated into two sections a legacy section which provides final salary and career average pension benefits and a new cash balance section.
The final salary element of the legacy section was closed to future accrual of benefits from 1st April 2010 and the career average element of the legacy section was closed to new entrants in October 2012 but remains open to future accrual for existing members.
All new entrants now join the cash balance section of the plan.
The legacy section provides benefits to members in the form of a set level of pension payable for life based on the members length of service and final pensionable salary at retirement or averaged over their career with the parent company.
The benefits attract inflation-related increases both before and after retirement.
The new cash balance section provides benefits to members at the point of retirement in the form of a cash lump sum.
The benefits attract inflation-related increases before retirement but following the payment of the retirement lump sum benefit the plan has no obligation to pay any further benefits to the member.
The group operates two defined benefit pension plans in the US.
The hourly pension plan is for unionised employees and provides a fixed retirement benefit for life based upon years of service.
The salaried pension plan provides retirement benefits for life based on the members length of service and final pensionable salary averaged over last five years.
The salaried plan benefits attract inflation-related increases before leaving but are non-increasing thereafter.
On retirement, members in either plan have the option to take the cash value of their benefit instead of a lifetime annuity in which case the plan has no obligation to pay any further benefits to the member.
The US salaried pension plan was closed to new entrants on 1st September 2013 but remains open to future accrual for existing members.
All new non-unionised US employees now join a defined contribution plan.
Funding UK legislation requires that pension plans are funded prudently and that when undertaking a funding valuation every three years assets are taken at their market value and the liabilities are determined based on a set of prudent assumptions set by the trustee following consultation with their appointed actuary.
The assumptions used for funding valuations may therefore differ to the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 accounting purposes.
The last funding valuation of JMEPS was carried out as at 1st April 2012.
This valuation showed that there was a deficit of 214 million on the agreed funding basis.
To address the deficit, the parent company agreed to make deficit contributions of 23.1 million per year from 1st April 2013 to 31st December 2019.
In addition, the parent company and trustee agreed to establish a special purpose vehicle SPV to provide additional deficit reduction contributions and to provide greater security to the trustee.
In January 2013, this SPV was set up and the group invested 50.0 million in a bond portfolio which is beneficially held by this SPV.
The income generated by the SPV will be used to make annual distributions of 3.5 million to JMEPS for a period of up to 25 years.
These annual distributions are only payable if the legacy section of JMEPS continues to be in deficit.
This bond portfolio is held as a non-current available-for-sale investment note 20 and the groups liability to pay the income to the plan is not a plan asset under IAS 19, although it is for actuarial funding valuation purposes.
In accordance with the governing documentation of JMEPS, any future plan surplus would be returned to the parent company by way of a refund assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the plan.
As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The last annual review of the US defined benefit pension plans was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 1st July 2013.
The company contributes US $6.0 million per year to prudently cover the cost of benefits and anticipated future funding needs.
The assumptions used for funding valuations may differ to the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 accounting purposes.
Similar funding valuations are undertaken on the groups other defined benefit pension plans outside of the UK and US in accordance with prevailing local legislation.

investing in a wide range of assets that provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security could have a material adverse impact on the plan.
A fide-risking strategy is in place to reduce volatility in the plans as a result of the mismatch between the assets and liabilities.
As the funding level of the plans improve and hit pre-agreed triggers, plan investments are switched from return seeking assets to liability matching assets.
The plans also implement partial currency hedging on their overseas assets to mitigate currency risk.
Interest rate risk Liabilities are sensitive to movements in bond yields The groups defined benefit plans hold a high proportion of their assets in interest rates, with lower interest rates leading to an government or corporate bonds, which provide a natural hedge against increase in the valuation of liabilities, albeit the impact falling interest rates.

The swaps are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk.
Inflation risk Liabilities are sensitive to movements in inflation, with Where plan benefits provide inflation-related increases the plan holds some higher inflation leading to an increase in the valuation of inflation-linked assets which provide a natural hedge against higher than liabilities.
In the UK, this inflation hedge is extended by the use of inflation rate swaps.
Longevity risk The majority of the groups defined benefit plans The group has closed most of its defined benefit pension plans to new provide benefits for the life of the member, so the entrants replacing them with either a cash balance plan or defined liabilities are sensitive to life expectancy, with increases contribution plans, both of which are unaffected by life expectancy.

mortality assumptions are used that appropriately allow for a future improvement in life expectancy.
These assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption.
Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the funding valuations under IAS 19 of the groups major defined benefit plans to 31st March 2014.
The assumptions used are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long term nature of the plans, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

Accounts Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2014 14 Post-employment benefits continued 14a Group continued Demographic assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables and where appropriate include an allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
In addition, where credible data exists, actual plan experience is taken into account.
The groups most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK and the US where, using the mortality tables adopted, the expected future lifetime of average members currently at age 65 and average members at age 65 in 25 years time i. e. members who are currently aged 40 years is respectively: Currently age 65 Age 65 in 25 years UK plan US plans UK plan US plans Male 21.9 20.6 24.1 23.3 Female 24.9 22.9 27.3 25.2 Sensitivities The calculations of the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the assumptions used.
The following summarises the estimated impact of a change in the assumption on the groups main plans while holding all other assumptions constant.
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in insolation of one another.

The assets for the cash balance section of the UK plan are held separately from the assets of the legacy section.
At 31st March 2014 the defined benefit obligation related to the contributory cash balance section was 4.3 million and the fair value of the plan assets was 4.3 million.
A curtailment gain arose in the UK pension plan as employees in the legacy section were given the option to move to the new cash balance section, which took effect at the start of the year.
A settlement gain arose in the US pension plans as some deferred pensioners were bought out during the year.
A curtailment gain arose in the US pension plans during the year as employees in the salaried pension plan were given the option to move to the new defined contribution plan.
Past service costs in the other plans arose mainly due to plan amendments caused by legislation changes in the Netherlands which increased the retirement age and decreased the maximum accrual rate.
