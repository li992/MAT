3.6 Tax This note details the accounting policies applied for tax, the current and deferred tax charges or credits in the year, a reconciliation of total tax expense to the accounting profit and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accounting policy Current tax for the current and prior periods is recognised, to the extent unpaid, as a liability at the amount expected to be paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax liabilities are measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
However, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences arising from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at 92 UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 3.6 Tax continued the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Current tax expense and deferred tax expense are recognised in the income statement except to the extent they arise from a transaction or event recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Any such tax expense is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity respectively.
The Group is a multi-national group with tax liabilities arising in many geographical locations.
This inherently leads to complexity in the Groups tax structure.
Therefore the calculation of the Groups current tax liabilities and tax expense necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.
The tax liabilities recognised in the financial statements are measured at the Directors estimate of tax that may become payable.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items.
As a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the income statement and tax payments.
The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period identified.
Income statement 2014 2013 m m Continuing Current tax expense 20.9 17.5 Exceptional deferred tax credit 29.9 Other deferred tax credit 5.9 6.6 Income tax credit expense 14.9 10.9 As a consequence of the acquisition of Advanstar, deferred tax assets in certain US companies that had previously not been recognised have now been recognised.
An exceptional tax credit of 29.9m has therefore been taken through the income statement.

Other comprehensive income No current or deferred tax relates to items reported in other comprehensive income 2013: nil.
Statement of financial position: current tax 2014 2013 m m Current tax liability at 1 January 45.4 52.7 Current tax expense 20.9 17.5 Tax paid 23.6 25.4 Currency translation and other movements 0.6 0.6 Current tax liability at 31 December 42.1 45.4 During the year, tax has been paid in the following jurisdictions: 2014 m China 11.1 Netherlands 3.7 Canada 1.9 Brazil 1.8 France 1.7 Other Emerging Markets 1.7 Other 1.7 Total 23.6 Statement of financial position: deferred tax Consolidated statement of Consolidated income financial position statement 2014 2013 2014 2013 Deferred tax liabilities assets m m m m Intangibles 66.2 44.1 24.7 6.2 Accelerated capital allowances 2.2 1.9 0.1 0.8 Tax losses 53.1 17.1 12.1 3.7 Other temporary differences 9.8 10.5 1.1 3.3 1.1 18.4 35.8 6.6 The movement in deferred tax balance during the year is: 2014 2013 m m Net deferred tax liability at 1 January 18.4 24.6 Acquisition of subsidiaries Note 6.1 20.0 0.7 Amounts credited to net profit 35.8 6.6 Disposals 0.2 Currency translation 1.3 0.3 Net deferred tax liability at 31 December 1.1 18.4 Analysed in the statement of financial position, after offset of balances within countries, as: Deferred tax assets 3.3 3.7 Deferred tax liabilities 4.4 22.1 1.1 18.4 The deferred tax asset of 3.3m 2013: 3.7m relates to tax losses and other temporary differences.
These have been recognised because the Group expects to generate taxable profits against which these losses will be used.
The Group has the following unused tax losses for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised: 255.6m 2013: 219.0m in UK subsidiaries which are available to offset against future UK corporate tax liabilities: 209.7m 2013: 236.8m in US subsidiaries which are available to offset against future US federal tax liabilities.
Of these 209.0m expire between 2019 and 2034 2013: 234.8m between 2019 and 2033 : 232.1m 2013: 232.1m of UK capital losses which are only available for offset against future capital gains: 6.7bn 2013: 7.1bn that have arisen in Luxembourg holding companies as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes: and 3.7m 2013: 0.5m in respect of companies in other countries.
94 UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 3.6 Tax continued No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of any of these amounts as it is uncertain that these losses will be utilised.
In addition the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets in relation to other deductible temporary differences of 15.0m 12.5m in relation to the UK, nil in relation to the US, and 2.5m in relation to other countries 2013: 35.1m 5.5m, 28.5m and 1.1m respectively.
No deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect these assets as it is uncertain that they will be utilised.
At 31 December 2014, net deferred tax liabilities of 1.1m have been recognised for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries.
No other deferred tax liabilities have been recognised as the Group has determined that profits of subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised amount in aggregate to 4.2bn 2013: 4.2bn.
3.7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Adjusted basic earnings per share excludes amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, deferred tax on amortisation of intangible assets, exceptional items and net financing expense adjustments detailed in Note 5.4.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The impact of dilutive securities in 2014 would be to increase weighted average shares by 3.1 million shares 2013: 3.7 million shares.
To fund the acquisition of Advanstar, the Group announced a fully underwritten 4 for 5 rights issue of 196,734,453 new shares at 287 pence per new share.
The 2013 numbers have been restated to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue.
The weighted average number of shares excludes ordinary shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan the ESOP.
Restated Weighted weighted Restated average no.
