178 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C3:  C3.1  The classification of the Groups assets and liabilities, and its corresponding accounting carrying values reflect the requirements of IFRS.
For financial investments the basis of valuation reflects the Groups application of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as described further below.
Where assets and liabilities have been valued at fair value or measured on a different basis but fair value is disclosed, the Group has followed the principles under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.

are subject to impairment testing where appropriate under IFRS requirements.
This category also includes assets which are valued by reference to specific IFRS standards such as reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities, deferred tax assets and investments accounted for under the equity method.
ii Realised gains and losses on the Groups investments for 2014 recognised in the income statement amounted to a net gain of 2.9 billion 2013: 2.5 billion.
iii The carrying value of investment contracts with discretionary participation features is on IFRS 4 basis.
It is impractical to determine the fair value of these contracts due to the lack of a reliable basis to measure participation features.
iv Loans and receivables are reported net of allowance for loan losses of 21 million 2013: 62 million.
v As at 31 December 2014, 477 million 2013: 495 million of convertible bonds were included in debt securities and 1,148 million 2013: 1,078 million were included in borrowings.
vi See note C3.5 b for details of the derivative assets included.
The balance also contains the PAC with-profits funds participation in various investment funds and limited liability property partnerships.
vii Assets and liabilities held for sale are valued at fair value less costs to sell.
182 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C3:  C3.2  The section provides detail of the designation and valuation of the Groups financial assets and liabilities shown under following categories: a  The fair values of the assets and liabilities of the Group as shown in this note have been determined on the following bases.
The fair values of the financial instruments for which fair valuation is required under IFRS are determined by the use of current market bid prices for exchange-quoted investments, or by using quotations from independent third parties, such as brokers and pricing services or by using appropriate valuation techniques.
The estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay in an arms length transaction.
This amount is determined using quoted prices if exchange listed, quotations from independent third parties or valued internally using standard market practices.
The loans and receivables have been shown net of provisions for impairment.
The fair value of loans has been estimated from discounted cash flows expected to be received.
The rate of discount used was the market rate of interest where applicable.
The fair value of investment properties is based on market values as assessed by professionally qualified external valuers or by the Groups qualified surveyors.
The fair value of the subordinated and senior debt issued by the parent company is determined using quoted prices from independent third parties.
The fair value of financial liabilities other than derivative financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flows of the amounts expected to be paid.
b  Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on the statement of financial position The table below shows the assets and liabilities carried at fair value analysed by level of the IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defined fair value hierarchy.
This hierarchy is based on the inputs to the fair value measurement and reflects the lowest level input that is significant to that measurement.

Where appropriate, the observable market interest rate has been used and the assets and liabilities are classified within level 2.
Otherwise, they are included as level 3 assets or liabilities.
The fair value included for the subordinated and senior debt issued by the parent company is determined using the quoted prices from independent third parties.
186 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C3:  c  A significant proportion of the Groups level 2 assets are corporate bonds, structured securities and other non-national government debt securities.
These assets, in line with market practice, are generally valued using independent pricing services or third-party broker quotes.
These valuations are determined using independent external quotations from multiple sources and are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis on prices achieved on subsequent trades.
Pricing services, where available, are used to obtain the third-party broker quotes.
Where pricing services providers are used, a single valuation is obtained and applied.
When prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced directly from brokers.
Prudential seeks to obtain a number of quotes from different brokers so as to obtain the most comprehensive information available on their executability.
Where quotes are sourced directly from brokers, the price used in the valuation is normally selected from one of the quotes based on a number of factors, including the timeliness and regularity of the quotes and the accuracy of the quotes considering the spreads provided.
The selected quote is the one which best represents an executable quote for the security at the measurement date.
Generally, no adjustment is made to the prices obtained from independent third parties.
Adjustment is made in only limited circumstances, where it is determined that the third-party valuations obtained do not reflect fair value eg either because the value is stale and or the values are extremely diverse in range.
These are usually securities which are distressed or that could be subject to a debt restructure or where reliable market prices are no longer available due to an inactive market or market dislocation.
In these instances, prices are derived using internal valuation techniques including those as described below in this note with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The techniques used require a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Examples of such variables include an average credit spread based on the corporate bond universe and the relevant duration of the asset being valued.
Prudential determines the input assumptions based on the best available information at the measurement dates.
Securities valued in such manner are classified as level 3 where these significant inputs are not based on observable market data.
Of the total level 2 debt securities of 107,731 million at 31 December 2014 2013: 100,687 million, 10,093 million are valued internally 2013: 8,556 million.
The majority of such securities are valued using matrix pricing, which is based on assessing the credit quality of the underlying borrower to derive a suitable discount rate relative to government securities of a comparable duration.
Under matrix pricing, the debt securities are priced taking the credit spreads on comparable quoted public debt securities and applying these to the equivalent debt instruments factoring in a specified liquidity premium.
The majority of the parameters used in this valuation technique are readily observable in the market and, therefore, are not subject to interpretation.
d  Reconciliation of movements in level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value The following table reconciles the value of level 3 fair valued assets and liabilities at 1 January 2014 to that presented at 31 December 2014.

Valuation approach for level 3 fair valued assets and liabilities Financial instruments at fair value Investments valued using valuation techniques include financial investments which by their nature do not have an externally quoted price based on regular trades, and financial investments for which markets are no longer active as a result of market conditions eg market illiquidity.
The valuation techniques used include comparison to recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option adjusted spread models and, if applicable, enterprise valuation.
These techniques may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these instruments.
When determining the inputs into the valuation techniques used priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based upon available market information and judgements about the financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of counterparties.
Such estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Groups entire holdings of a particular financial instrument, nor do they consider the tax impact of the realisation of unrealised gains or losses from selling the financial instrument being fair valued.
In some cases the disclosed value cannot be realised in immediate settlement of the financial instrument.
In accordance with the Groups risk management framework, the estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments valued internally using standard market practices are subject to assessment against external counterparties valuations.
At 31 December 2014, the Group held 3,760 million 2013: 3,385 million of net financial instruments at fair value within level 3.
This represents 1 per cent 2013: 2 per cent of the total fair valued financial assets net of fair valued financial liabilities.
Included within these amounts were loans of 2,025 million at 31 December 2014 2013: 1,887 million, measured as the loan outstanding balance, attached to REALIC and held to back the liabilities for funds withheld under reinsurance arrangements.
The funds withheld liability of 2,201 million at 31 December 2014 2013: 2,051 million was also classified within level 3, accounted for on a fair value basis being equivalent to the carrying value of the underlying assets.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 189 Excluding the loans and funds withheld liability under REALICs reinsurance arrangements as described above, which amounted to a net liability of 176 million 2013: 164 million, the level 3 fair valued financial assets net of financial liabilities were 3,936 million 2013: 3,549 million.
Of this amount, a net asset of 11 million 2013: net liability of 304 million were internally valued, representing less than 0.1 per cent of the total fair valued financial assets net of financial liabilities 2013: 0.1 per cent.
Internal valuations are inherently more subjective than external valuations.
Included within these internally valued net asset liability were: a Debt securities of 298 million 2013: 118 million, which were either valued on a discounted cash flow method with an internally developed discount rate or on external prices adjusted to reflect the specific known conditions relating to these securities eg distressed securities or securities which were being restructured.
b Private equity and venture investments of 1,002 million 2013: 878 million which were valued internally based on management information available for these investments.
These investments were principally held by consolidated investment funds which are managed on behalf of third parties.
c Liabilities of 1,269 million 2013: 1,301 million for the net asset value attributable to external unit holders in respect of the consolidated investment funds, which are non-recourse to the Group.
These liabilities are valued by reference to the underlying assets.
d Derivative liabilities of 23 million 2013: nil which are valued internally using standard market practices but are subject to independent assessment against external counterparties valuations.
e Other sundry individual financial investments of 3 million 2013: 1 million.
Of the internally valued net asset referred to above of 11 million 2013: net liability of 304 million : a A net liability of 133 million 2013: net liability of 380 million was held by the Groups participating funds and therefore shareholders profit and equity are not impacted by movements in the valuation of these financial instruments.
b A net asset of 144 million 2013: 76 million was held to support non-linked shareholder-backed business.
If the value of all the level 3 instruments held to support non-linked shareholder-backed business valued internally was varied downwards by 10 per cent, the change in valuation would be 14 million 2013: 8 million, which would reduce shareholders equity by this amount before tax.
Of this amount, a decrease of 13 million 2013: a decrease of 6 million would pass through the income statement substantially as part of short-term fluctuations in investment returns outside of operating profit and a 1 million decrease 2013: a decrease of 2 million would be included as part of other comprehensive income, being unrealised movements on assets classified as available-for-sale.
Other assets at fair value investment properties The investment properties of the Group are principally held by the UK insurance operations which are externally valued by professionally qualified external valuers using the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS valuation standards.
An income capitalisation technique is predominantly applied for these properties.
This technique calculates the value through the yield and rental value depending on factors such as the lease length, building quality, covenant and location.
The variables used are compared to recent transactions with similar features to those of the Groups investment properties.
As the comparisons are not with properties which are virtually identical to Groups investment properties, adjustments are made by the valuers where appropriate to the variables used.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of the properties.
e  The Groups policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of levels as of the end of each half year reporting period except for material transfers which are recognised as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
During 2014, the transfers between levels within the Groups portfolio were primarily transfers from level 1 to 2 of 618 million and transfers from level 2 to level 1 of 223 million.
These transfers which relate to equity securities and debt securities arose to reflect the change in the observability of the inputs used in valuing these securities.
In addition, in 2014, the transfers into level 3 were 13 million and the transfers out of level 3 were 34 million.
These transfers were between levels 3 and 2 and primarily for equity securities and debt securities.
f  The Groups valuation policies, procedures and analyses for instruments categorised as level 3 are overseen by Business Unit committees as part of the Groups wider financial reporting governance processes.
The procedures undertaken include approval of valuation methodologies, verification processes, and resolution of significant or complex valuation issues.
In undertaking these activities the Group makes use of the extensive expertise of its asset management functions.

Where available, quoted market prices are used.
However, where securities do not have an externally quoted price based on regular trades or where markets for the securities are no longer active as a result of market conditions, IAS 39 requires that valuation techniques be applied.
IFRS 13 requires classification of the fair values applied by the Group into a three level hierarchy.
At 31 December 2014, 0.1 per cent of Jacksons debt securities were classified as level 3 31 December 2013: 0.1 per cent comprising of fair values where there are significant inputs which are not based on observable market data.
Except for certain assets covering liabilities that are measured at fair value, the debt securities of the US insurance operations are classified as available-for-sale.
Unless impaired, fair value movements are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Realised gains and losses, including impairments, recorded in the income statement are as shown in note B1.2 of this report.
Movements in unrealised gains and losses on available-for-sale securities There was a movement in the statement of financial position value for debt securities classified as available-for-sale from a net unrealised gain of 781 million to a net unrealised gain of 1,840 million as analysed in the table below.
This increase reflects the effects of decreasing long-term interest rates.

The Group has no cash flow hedges and in general, contractual maturities are not considered essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows for these instruments.
The only exception is certain identified interest rate swaps which are fully expected to be held until maturity solely for the purposes of matching cash flows on separately held assets and liabilities.
For these instruments the undiscounted cash flows including contractual interest amounts due to be paid under the swap contract assuming conditions are consistent with those at year end are included in the column relating to the contractual maturity of the derivative.

Therefore, most contracts can be said to have a contractual maturity of less than one year, but in reality the additional charges and term of the contracts mean these are unlikely to be exercised in practice and the more useful information is to present information on expected payment.
The maturity profile above excludes certain corporate unit-linked business with gross policyholder liabilities of 13 billion 2013: 13 billion which have no stated maturity but which are repayable on demand.
The vast majority of the Groups financial assets are held to back the Groups policyholder liabilities.
Although asset liability matching is an important component of managing policyholder liabilities both those classified as insurance and those classified as investments, this profile is mainly relevant for managing market risk rather than liquidity risk.
Within each business unit this asset liability matching is performed on a  basis.
In terms of liquidity risk a large proportion of the policyholder liabilities contain discretionary surrender values or surrender charges, meaning that many of the Groups liabilities are expected to be held for the long term.
Much of the Groups investment portfolios are in marketable securities, which can therefore be converted quickly to liquid assets.
For the reasons above an analysis of the Groups assets by contractual maturity is not considered appropriate to evaluate the nature and extent of the Groups liquidity risk.
ii Market and other financial risks The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk of financial instruments before any allowance for collateral or allocation of losses to policyholders is represented by the carrying value of financial instruments on the balance sheet that have exposures to credit risk comprising cash and cash equivalents, deposits, debt securities, loans and derivative assets, and other debtors, the carrying value of which are disclosed at the start of this note and note C3.5 b below for derivative assets.
The collateral in place in relation to derivatives is described in note C3.5 c below.
Note C3.4 describes the security for these loans held by the Group, as disclosed at the start of this note.
Of the total loans and receivables held, 11 million 2013: 14 million are past their due date but are not impaired.
Of the total past due but not impaired, 5 million are less than one year past their due date 2013: 9 million.
The Group expects full recovery of these loans and receivables.
No further analysis has been provided of the element of loans and receivables that was neither past due nor impaired for the total portfolio on the grounds of immateriality of the difference between the neither past due nor impaired elements and the total portfolio.
Financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated amounted to 13 million 2013: 59 million.
In addition, during 2014 and 2013 the Group did not take possession of any other collateral held as security.
Further details of collateral and pledges are provided in note C3.5 c below.
iii Foreign exchange risk As at 31 December 2014, the Group held 22 per cent 2013: 20 per cent and 9 per cent 2013: 7 per cent of its financial assets and financial liabilities respectively, in currencies, mainly US dollar and Euro, other than the functional currency of the relevant business unit.
Of these financial assets, 56 per cent 2013: 58 per cent are held by the PAC with-profits fund, allowing the fund to obtain exposure to foreign equity markets.
Of these financial liabilities, 47 per cent 2013: 28 per cent are held by the PAC with-profits fund, mainly relating to foreign currency borrowings.
The exchange risks inherent in these exposures are mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts note C3.5 b below.
The amount of exchange gain recognised in the income statement in 2014, except for those arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, is 89 million 2013: 284 million loss.
This constitutes 1 million loss 2013: 1 million gain on Medium Term Notes liabilities and 90 million of net gain 2013: 285 million net loss, mainly arising on investments of the PAC with-profits fund.
The gains losses on Medium Term Notes liabilities are fully offset by value movements on cross-currency swaps, which are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 201 b  Derivatives The Group enters into a variety of exchange traded and over-the-counter derivative financial instruments, including futures, options, forward currency contracts and swaps such as interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, swaptions and credit default swaps.
All over-the-counter derivative transactions, with the exception of some Asia transactions, are conducted under standardised ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc master agreements and the Group has collateral agreements between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties in place under each of these market master agreements.
The total fair value balances of derivative assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2014 were as follows: 2014 m Asia US UK insurance insurance insurance Asset Unallocated Group operations operations operations management toasegment total Derivative assets 47 916 2,344 103 2 3,412 Derivative liabilities 143 251 1,381 233 315 2,323 96 665 963 130 313 1,089 2013 m Asia US UK insurance insurance insurance Asset Unallocated Group operations operations operations management toasegment total Derivative assets 41 766 1,472 47 3 2,329 Derivative liabilities 58 515 804 112 200 1,689 17 251 668 65 197 640 The derivative assets are included in other investments in the statement of financial position and are used for efficient portfolio management to obtain cost effective and efficient management of exposure to various markets in accordance with the Groups investment strategies and to manage exposure to interest rate, currency, credit and other business risks.
The Group also uses interest rate derivatives to reduce exposure to interest rate volatility.
In particular: UK with-profits funds use derivatives for efficient portfolio management or reduction in investment risks.
For UK annuity business derivatives are used to assist with asset and liability cash flow matching: US operations and some of the UK operations hold large amounts of interest-rate sensitive investments that contain credit risks on which a certain level of defaults is expected.
These businesses have purchased some swaptions to manage the default risk on certain underlying assets and hence reduce the amount of regulatory capital held to support the assets: and Some products, especially in the US, have guarantee features linked to equity indices.
A mismatch between guaranteed product liabilities and the performance of the underlying assets exposes the Group to equity index risk.
In order to mitigate this risk, the relevant business units purchase swaptions, equity options and futures to better match asset performance with liabilities under equity-indexed products.
Hedging The Group has formally assessed and documented the effectiveness of the following hedges under IAS 39.
Fair value hedges The Group had previously designated as a fair value hedge certain fixed to floating rate swaps which hedge the fair value exposure to interest rate movements of certain of the Groups operational borrowings.
All of these hedges were terminated by January 2013.
Movements in the fair value of the hedging instruments of a net gain of 0.3 million and the hedged items of a net loss of 0.3 million were recorded in the 2013 income statement in respect of these fair value hedges.
Net investment hedges At 31 December 2014, the Group has designated perpetual subordinated capital securities totalling US$2.8 billion 2013: US$3.55 billion as a net investment hedge to hedge the currency risks related to the net investment in Jackson.
The carrying value of the subordinated capital securities was 1,789 million as at 31 December 2014 2013: 2,133 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 96 million 2013: gain of 46 million on translation of the borrowings to pounds sterling at the statement of financial position date is recognised in the translation reserve in shareholders equity.
This net investment hedge was 100 per cent effective.
The Group has no cash flow hedges in place.
c Derecognition,  Securities lending and reverse repurchase agreements The Group has entered into securities lending including repurchase agreements whereby blocks of securities are loaned to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms.
The amounts above the fair value of the loaned securities required to be received as collateral by the agreements depend on the quality of the collateral, calculated on a daily basis.
The loaned securities are not removed from the Groups consolidated statement of financial position, rather they are retained within the appropriate investment classification.
Collateral typically consists of cash, debt securities, equity securities and letters of credit.
202 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C3:  At 31 December 2014, the Group had lent 4,578 million 2013: 3,791 million of securities of which 3,129 million 2013: 2,910 million was lent by the PAC with-profits fund and held cash and securities collateral under such agreements of 4,887 million 2013: 3,930 million of which 3,400 million 2013: 3,012 million was held by the PAC with-profits fund.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had entered into reverse repurchase transactions under which it purchased securities and had taken on the obligation to resell the securities.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of these transactions was 12,857 million 2013: 9,931 million.
In addition, at 31 December 2014, the Group had entered into repurchase transactions for which the fair value of the collateral pledged was securities of 186 million 2013: cash pledged of 17 million and securities pledged of 524 million.
Collateral and pledges under derivative transactions At 31 December 2014, the Group had pledged 1,411 million 2013: 780 million for liabilities and held collateral of 2,388 million 2013: 1,432 million in respect of over-the-counter derivative transactions.
These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to collateralised transactions including, where relevant, standard securities lending and repurchase agreements.
Offsetting assets and liabilities The Groups derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral arrangements.
A master netting arrangement with a counterparty creates a right of offset for amounts due to and due from that same counterparty that is enforceable in the event of a default or bankruptcy.
The Group recognises amounts subject to master netting arrangements on a gross basis within the consolidated balance sheets.
The following tables present the gross and net information about the Groups financial instruments subject to master netting arrangements: 31Dec2014 m Grossamount  presentedinthe  consolidated statementof financial Financial Cash Securities position instruments collateral collateral Netamount note i note ii note iii Financial assets: Derivative assets 3,271 1,030 1,131 824 286 Reverse repurchase agreements 10,537 10,537 Total financial assets 13,808 1,030 1,131 11,361 286 Financial liabilities: Derivative liabilities 2,036 1,030 391 543 72 Securities lending 1,317 1,317 Repurchase agreements 186 186 Total financial liabilities 3,539 1,030 1,708 729 72 31Dec2013 m Grossamount  presentedinthe  consolidated statementof financial Financial Cash Securities position instruments collateral collateral Netamount note i note ii note iii Financial assets: Derivative assets 2,136 832 555 631 118 Reverse repurchase agreements 9,931 9,931 Total financial assets 12,067 832 555 10,562 118 Financial liabilities: Derivative liabilities 1,479 832 222 333 92 Securities lending 1,242 1,242 Repurchase agreements 541 17 524 Total financial liabilities 3,262 832 1,481 857 92 Notes i The Group has not offset any of the amounts presented in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 203 In the tables above, the amounts of assets or liabilities presented in the consolidated statement of financial position are offset first by financial instruments that have the right of offset under master netting or similar arrangements with any remaining amount reduced by the amount of cash and securities collateral.
The actual amount of collateral may be greater than amounts presented in the tables.
d  In accordance with the Groups accounting policy set out in note A3.1j iii, impairment reviews were performed for available-for-sale securities and loans and receivables.
In addition, impairment reviews were undertaken for the reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, net impairment reversals of 37 million 2013: 17 million were recognised for available-for-sale securities and loans and receivables analysed as follows: 2014 m 2013 m Available-for-sale debt securities held by Jackson 7 8 Loans and receivables 44 25 Net credit for impairment net of reversals 37 17 Relates to loans held by the UK with-profits fund and mortgage loans held by Jackson.
Impairment recognised on available-for-sale securities amounted to 7 million 2013: 8 million arising from: 2014 m 2013 m Residential mortgage-backed securities 2 3 Other 5 5 7 8 The impairment recorded on the residential mortgage-backed securities was primarily due to reduced cash flow expectations on such securities that are collateralised by diversified pools of primarily below investment grade securities.
Of the impaired losses of 7 million 2013: 8 million, the top five individual corporate issuers made up 76 per cent 2013: 57 per cent, reflecting a deteriorating business outlook of the companies concerned.
The impairment losses have been recorded in investment return in the income statement.
Jacksons portfolio of debt securities is managed proactively with credit analysts closely monitoring and reporting on the credit quality of its holdings.
Jackson continues to review its investments on a case-by-case basis to determine whether any decline in fair value represents an impairment.
In addition, investments in structured securities are subject to a rigorous review of their future estimated cash flows, including expected and stress case scenarios, to identify potential shortfalls in contractual payments both interest and principal.
Impairment charges are recorded on structured securities when the Company forecasts a contractual payment shortfall.
Situations where such a shortfall would not lead to a recognition of a loss are rare.
However, some structured securities do not have a single determined set of future cash flows and instead, there can be a reasonable range of estimates that could potentially emerge.
With this variability, there could be instances where the projected cash flow shortfall under managements base case set of assumptions is so minor that relatively small and justifiable changes to the base case assumptions would eliminate the need for an impairment loss to be recognised.
The impairment loss reflects the difference between the fair value and book value.
In 2014, the Group realised gross losses on sales of available-for-sale securities of 35 million 2013: 22 million with 68 per cent 2013: 72 per cent of these losses related to the disposal of fixed maturity securities of the top 10 individual issuers, which were disposed of as part of risk reduction programmes intended to limit future credit loss exposure.
Of the 35 million 2013: 22 million, 5 million 2013: 5 million relates to losses on sales of impaired and deteriorating securities.
The effect of those reasonably likely changes in the key assumptions that underpin the assessment of whether impairment has taken place depends on the factors described in note A3.1j iii.
A key indicator of whether such impairment may arise in future, and the potential amounts at risk, is the profile of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity securities accounted for on an available-for-sale basis by reference to the time periods by which the securities have been held continuously in an unrealised loss position and by reference to the maturity date of the securities concerned.
For 2014, the amount of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale under IFRS in an unrealised loss position was 180 million 2013: 849 million.
Notes B1.2 and C3.3 provide further details on the impairment charges and unrealised losses of Jacksons available-for-sale securities.
