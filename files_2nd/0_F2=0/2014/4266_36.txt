CSR in review Strategic report Governance Other information Financial statements Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where they relate to the same taxation authority and net settlement and offset is permitted.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 26 December 2014 27 December 2013 $000 $000 Deferred tax assets 129,296 109,181 Deferred tax liabilities 3,910 4,948 125,386 104,233 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of $858,804,327 2013: $716,703,068 and unused tax credits of $39,517,828 2013: $38,192,791 available for offset against future profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining unused tax losses of $582,246,258 2013: $498,808,643 and unused tax credits of $27,600,726 2013: $26,728,251 due to either a history of tax losses, uncertain tax positions, or it is not considered probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to realise the benefit of all deferred tax assets within certain subsidiary entities.
Included in unrecognised tax losses and unrecognised tax credits are tax losses of $257,735,277 2013: $212,129,934 and tax credits of $27,600,276 2013: $26,728,251 that will expire in 5-19 years.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, no deferred tax liability has been recognised on temporary differences of $30,311,672 2013: $28,289,628 relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 26 December 2014 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
The recognition of the deferred tax asset is based on managements assessment of historic profitability, forecasted operating results based upon approved business plans and a review of the tax planning opportunities.
Based on this, management concluded that there is convincing evidence for the recognition of deferred tax assets in excess of the deferred tax liability by $106,336,381 2013: $88,250,962 in entities that have suffered a loss in the current or preceding periods.
12 Earnings Loss Per Share Basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing profit loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue throughout the period, adjusting for ordinary shares held in Treasury and ordinary shares held by the Employee benefit Trust.
For diluted earnings loss per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is further adjusted for the effect of potentially dilutive ordinary shares, arising from the assumed exercise of employee share options and share awards that are in the money and for which management has identied that performance conditions, associated with the vesting of certain employee share options and awards, is likely to be achieved.
For a description of the Groups employee share option and share award plans, refer to note 29.
Earnings loss per share is only diluted when the result for the period is a profit.
13 Goodwill Cost $000 At 27 December 2013 and 28 December 2012 218,784 Recognised on acquisition of Reciva Limited 1,991 At 26 December 2014 220,775 Accumulated impairment losses At 28 December 2012 36,907 Impairment of goodwill associated with Cameras cash generating unit 50,537 At 26 December 2014 and 27 December 2013 87,444 Carrying Amount At 26 December 2014 133,331 At 27 December 2013 131,340 At 28 December 2012 181,877 www.
com 107 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 13 Goodwill continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Further disclosures are provided below for all cash generating units where the Group holds an individual goodwill item relating to a CGU which is significant, which management considers to be 10% of the total net book value in comparison with the Groups total carrying value of goodwill, or, where there are no significant allocations of goodwill at a lower level, for groups of cash generating units within a reportable segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 26 December 2014 27 December 2013 Reportable segments and cash generating units $000 $000 Automotive Business Group 51,404 51,404 Consumer Business Group Printers 58,161 58,161 Other Consumer CGUs 9,505 9,505 Voice & Music Business Group 14,261 12,270 133,331 131,340 Movements in goodwill In 2014 the acquisition of the people and assets of Reciva Limited recognised goodwill of $2.0 million, all of which was allocated to the Voice & Music cash generating unit.
In 2013 $50.5 million of goodwill allocated to the Cameras CGU was impaired following the decision to cease development of future cameraon-a-chip COACH platform products.
There is now no goodwill allocated to the Cameras cash generating unit.
During 2012 goodwill of $151.5 million allocated to the Legacy CGU was fide-recognised following the disposal of development operations in handset connectivity and handset location to Samsung during 2012, as it was no longer deemed to be recoverable.
There is now no goodwill allocated to this CGU.
2014 impairment testing The Group tests the assets allocated to different CGUs for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The assets tested include directly attributable goodwill, intangible and tangible assets, and inventory as well as an allocation of corporate assets.
The recoverable value in use was estimated as the fair value less costs of disposal based on the offer price received from Qualcomm as disclosed in the Scheme document published in November 2014.
Costs of disposal were also estimated based on the Scheme document updated to reect the actual costs incurred to date, as well as costs expected to be incurred.
The recoverable value was then allocated to CGUs based on an estimate of the relative fair value of each CGU.
The estimation methodology is the same for all cash generating units.
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on a variety of scenarios when completing the annual impairment review.
The directors have concluded that there are no cash generating units where reasonably possible changes in assumptions would cause the carrying amount of a CGU to exceed its recoverable value.
2013 impairment testing In 2013 the Group estimated the recoverable amount based on the Groups value in use.
The estimation methodology was the same for all cash generating units.
The value in use calculations were based upon cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget and longer range financial plans which were reviewed and approved by management and the Board of Directors.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations were those regarding the growth in future sales, projected production costs, operating expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates.
Future sales were estimated based on recent reports on the markets the Group operates in, produced by independent analysts and containing estimates for market size for a number of different technologies in different end markets.
These external estimates were compared with internal estimates to produce a considered view of available market size and likely market shares.
Management used this information, combined with internal customer specic information regarding design wins, projected changes in market share-based on current positions and forecast technology penetration rates, to derive its best assessment of the future sales and gross margins.
A terminal value was included for the period beyond five years from the balance sheet date based upon the estimated cashows in the fifth year and a terminal growth rate of 3.5%.
This rate was based on our assessment of the future growth potential of the Group, considering that much of our business operates in Asian markets where growth rates are typically high.
While growth rates fell globally due to the macro economic situation, this rate was beneath the long term growth rate projected for our major markets.
Variation in selling prices and direct costs were based on well established trends in the semiconductor industry as well as managements experience of how pricing and direct costs vary over a products lifecycle, incorporating the impacts of already quoted selling prices and the result of discussions with suppliers on future direct cost movements.
Projected operating expenditures were based upon the long term operating model of the Group, adjusted to remove the impact of any planned restructuring activities.
Management used discount rates that equated to the weighted average cost of capital and estimating risk free rates based on US Treasury Bonds, using published equity betas for the Group and making a reasonable estimate of the Equity Risk Premium.
Management has concluded that it was appropriate to use a pre tax discount rate of 12.7% in 2013, which fully reected the risk prole of the Group.
