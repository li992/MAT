FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 114 NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 10 Adjusted gures The Group uses adjusted gures as additional performance measures.
Adjusted operating profit excludes amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and the share of taxes in joint ventures.
Acquisition-related costs relate to acquisition integration, transaction-related fees, and those elements of deferred and contingent consideration required to be expensed under IFRS.
Adjusted profit before tax also excludes disposal-related and other non-operating items and the net nancing charge or credit on dened benefit pension schemes.
The adjusted tax charge excludes the tax effect of these adjusting items and movements on deferred tax assets and liabilities related to goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
It includes the benefit of tax amortisation where available on goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
Adjusted cash ow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures, but before payments in relation to prior year exceptional restructuring programmes and acquisition-related costs.
