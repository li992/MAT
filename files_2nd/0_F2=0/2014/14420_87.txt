2 Commercial Reserves and Contingent Resources are internal management estimates based on operator data and the ERCE study of TGT field resources including the Geological and revised Dynamic Simulation model.
3 Assumes oil equivalent conversion factor of 6000 scf boe.
4 Congo volumes are associated with the Viodo discovery.
Reserves are shown before deductions for non-controlling interests which are funded by the Group.
The Group is entitled to receive 100% of the cash flows until it has recovered its funding of the non-controlling interest including a rate of return from the noncontrolling interests pro rata portion of those cash flows.
5 Based on the assessment of the range of STOIIP and the recovery factors in the Dynamic Simulation Model prepared by ERCE, additional volumes are being recognised as 3C Contingent Resources.
This is described in detail in the Review of Operations.
Risks associated with reserve evaluation and estimation uncertainty are discussed in Note 4 b to the Financial Statements.
