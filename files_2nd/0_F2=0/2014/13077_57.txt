Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 19 Contingent liabilities The Group is involved in a number of investigations by government authorities and has made provisions for such investigations, where appropriate.
Where it is too early to determine the likely outcome of these matters, the Directors have made no provision for such potential liabilities.
The Group from time to time is involved in disputes in relation to ongoing tax matters in a number of jurisdictions around the world.
Where appropriate, the Directors make provisions based on their assessment of each case.

21 Pension and other Post-retirement Commitments Plan details The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans around the world covering many of its employees, which are principally funded.
The Groups most significant defined benefit pension plan UK is a final salary plan, which closed to new entrants in 2005.
Trustees of the plan are appointed by the Group, active members and pensioner membership, and are responsible for the governance of the plan, including paying all administrative costs and compliance with regulations.
The plan is funded by the payment of contributions to the plans Trust, which is a separate entity from the rest of the Group.
The Group also operates a number of other post-retirement plans in certain countries.
The major plan is in the US US Retiree Health Care Plan, where salaried participants become eligible for retiree health care benefits after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered figure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
This plan closed to new members in 2009.
A Benefits Committee of the plan is appointed by the Group, and is responsible for the governance of the plan, including paying all administrative costs and compliance with regulations.
The following table provides details of membership for all plans in the two principal territories: Plan details at last valuation date UK US Active Participants: Number of members 365 2,232 Proportion of funding liability 13% 32% Total pensionable salary roll 15.3m 57.2m Participants with deferred benefits: Number of members 5,949 2,814 Proportion of funding liability 29% 23% Total deferred pensions at date of leaving plan 18.7m 2.7m Participants receiving benefits: Number of members 6,902 4,044 Proportion of funding liability 58% 45% Total pensions in payment 41.7m 6.8m Full independent actuarial valuations are carried out on a triennial basis.
For the principal UK plan, the most recent valuation was carried out at 5 April 2013.
For the US plan, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 January 2012.
The Group has agreed that it will aim to eliminate the pension plan Technical Provisions deficit in the UK and Ireland over the next four years.
Funding levels are monitored on an annual basis and the current agreed contribution rate is 19.5% of pensionable salaries in the UK and nil in the US.
It is expected that contributions in 2015 will be 58m to the UK defined benefit plan and nil to the US Retiree Health Care Plan.
This will be reviewed after each triennial valuation is signed off by the Group and Trustee.
The Group considers that the contribution rates set at the last valuation date, and any future further contributions in excess of the contribution rate, will be sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed period and that regular contributions, which are based on service costs, will not increase significantly.
For the purpose of IAS19 the projected unit valuation method was used for the UK and US plans, rolling forward the preliminary UK plan triennial valuation results at 5 April 2013 and the 1 January 2012 US plan valuation to 31 December 2014.
The UK plans have a weighted average duration of the deferred benefit obligation of 17.9 years 2013: 17.3 years.
RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 104 Financial Statements 21 Pension and other Post-retirement Commitments continued Significant Actuarial Assumptions The significant actuarial assumptions used in determining the Groups net liability for the two major plans as at 31 December were: 2014 2013 Uk US medical UK US Medical % % % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.3 3.6 Rate of increase in deferred pensions during deferment 3.1 3.4 Rate of increase in pension payments 2.9 3.1 Discount rate 3.5 3.9 4.4 4.8 Inflation assumption RPI 3.3 3.6 Annual medical cost inflation 5.09.0 5.09.0 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with published statistics and experience in each territory.
The expected lifetime of a participant aged 60 and the expected lifetime of a participant who will be age 60 in 15 years 20 years in the US are detailed below: 2014 2013 Uk US UK US years years years years number of years a current pensioner is expected to live beyond 60: Male 28.5 26.1 28.4 25.1 Female 30.5 28.6 30.3 27.5 number of years a future pensioner is expected to live beyond 60: Male 30.3 27.9 30.2 27.3 Female 32.3 30.3 32.2 29.4 For the UK plan, the mortality assumptions were based on the standard SAPS mortality table with medium cohort improvements to 2009 scaled by 90% for males and 100% for females.
Allowance for future improvements is made by adopting the 2012 edition of the CMI series with a long-term trend of 1.5% per annum.
For the US plan the mortality assumptions were determined using the RP-2014 Total Dataset Employee version precommencement, and Health Annuitant post-commencement, projected on a generational basis with Scale MP-2014.
impact of rB Pharmaceuticals demerger Employees who will be employed within the Indivior Group after the demerger have membership of the new Indivior Pension Schemes for service on and after the demerger.
Plan assets and liabilities for former RB Pharmaceuticals employees in relation to services rendered prior to the demerger will remain with the Group.

Sensitivity of Significant Actuarial Assumptions The sensitivity of the UK defined benefit obligation to changes in the principal assumptions 2014 Change in assumption Change in defined benefit obligation Discount rate increase 0.1% decrease by 1.8% RPI increase increase 0.1% increase by 1.4% Life expectancy members younger by 1 year increase by 2.3% 2013 Change in assumption Change in defined benefit obligation Discount rate Increase 0.1% Decrease by 1.8% RPI increase Increase 0.1% Increase by 1.4% Life expectancy Members younger by 1 year Increase by 2.3% The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
