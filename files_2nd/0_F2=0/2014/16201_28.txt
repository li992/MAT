com 153 Financial Statements COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014 h Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payments.
The Company has equity-settled and cash-settled sharebased awards as defined by FRS 20.
The fair value of these awards has been determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the effect of any market-based performance conditions.
This fair value, adjusted by the Companys estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest as a result of non-market conditions, is expensed uniformly over the vesting period.
The fair values were calculated using a binomial option pricing model with suitable modifications to allow for employee turnover after vesting and early exercise.
Where necessary this model was supplemented with a Monte Carlo model.
The inputs to the models include: the share price at date of grant: exercise price: expected volatility: expected dividends: risk-free rate of interest: and patterns of exercise of the plan participants.
i Capital management The Company defines capital as the total equity of the Company.
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
Tullow is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, and put in place new debt facilities.
j Adoption of FRS 101 The Companys current basis of accounting is UK GAAP, which the Financial Reporting Council has announced is to change for reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015.
The company has chosen FRS 101 as its basis of accounting going forward, and that will be adopted for reporting for the year ended 31 December 2015 and beyond.
FRS 101 paragraph 5 a requires the Company to give its shareholders notice of the adoption of the new standard, and to proceed with the proposal provided that a shareholder or shareholders holding in aggregate 5% or more of the Companys issued shares do not object to the proposal, which they may do in writing to the Company Secretary at its Registered Office by not later than 30 April 2015.

Investments continued The Company is required to assess the carrying values of each of its investments in subsidiaries for impairment.
The net assets of certain of the Companys subsidiaries are predominantly intangible exploration and evaluation E&E assets.
Where facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an E&E asset held by a subsidiary may exceed its recoverable amount, by reference to the specific indicators of impairment of E&E assets, an impairment test of the asset is performed by the subsidiary undertaking and the asset is impaired by any difference between its carrying value and its recoverable amount.
The recognition of such an impairment by a subsidiary is used by the Company as the primary basis for determining whether or not there are indications that the investment in the related subsidiary may also be impaired, and thus whether an impairment test of the investment carrying value needs to be performed.
The results of exploration activities are inherently uncertain, and the assessment of impairment of E&E assets by the subsidiary, and that of the related investment by the Company, is judgemental.

Subsequent events In January 2015, Tullow announced the results of the Ngamia-6 and Amosing-3 appraisal wells.
Ngamia-6 was drilled to a final depth of 2,480 metres encountering up to 135 metres of net oil pay.
The Amosing-3 well in Block 10BB continued the successful appraisal of the Amosing oil field.
The well successfully encountered over 107 metres of net oil pay in good quality reservoir sands.
The well reached a final depth of 2,403 metres and has been suspended for use in future appraisal and development activities.
In January 2015, Tullow also announced completion of the Epir-1 exploration well located in Block 10BB in the North Kerio Basin.
Whilst not a discovery, the well encountered oil and wet gas shows over a 100 metre interval of non-reservoir quality rocks, demonstrating a working petroleum system in this lacustrine sub-basin.
