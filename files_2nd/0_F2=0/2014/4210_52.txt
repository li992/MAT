112 Croda Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Directors Report Financial Statements Other Information Impairment testing for goodwill The goodwill relates predominantly to the value of commercial and other synergies arising from the combination of acquired businesses, or the specific technologies or products acquired, with Crodas established global sales, marketing and R&D networks.
This goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to CGUs as follows: 2014 2013 m m Uniqema Personal Care and Life Sciences 193.4 193.4 SIPO 19.9 17.4 Other 20.4 18.5 233.7 229.3 As discussed in the accounting policies note on page 97, goodwill is tested at each year end for impairment with reference to the relevant CGUs recoverable amount compared to the units carrying value including goodwill.
Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there areseparately identifiable cash flows relevant to the acquisition generating the goodwill.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations using pre-tax discounted cash flow projections based on the Groups current year results and a long term future growth rate for25years.
These projections are for a period of 25 years as the Group made these investments for the long term.
Unless the risk profile of a particular acquisition dictates otherwise, the cash flows are discounted using a rate derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been calculated to be approximately 5.9% before tax 2013: 5.8% for Uniqema.
A long term future growth rate of 3% was used for this calculation.
For the purposes of the Sipo calculation, the rate was increased to7.4% because of the slightly higher risk associated with this investment.
An initial growth rate of 10% has been used for the first five years, which reflects the Directors growth expectations in that market.
A long term growth rate of 5% was then used beyond five years.
The key assumptions underpinning the forecasts employed in the value in use calculation reflect a prudent view of past experience and are that market share will not change significantly and that gross and operating margins will remain broadly constant.
In respect of the brought forward goodwill, the Directors believe there are no reasonably probable significant changes in assumptions which would give rise to an impairment charge in the year.
Goodwill arising in the year will be subject to the same assumptions and review process commencing the yearafter initial recognition.
Reclassifications represent amounts transferred from plant and equipment upon completion of asset construction projects.
Whilst these projects remain in progress, all capital expenditure is disclosed within plant and equipment.
