Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, unutilised tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable income is probable.
To determine the future taxable income, reference is made to the latest available profit forecast which takes into account production volumes, LNG Shipping & Marketing supply volumes and commodity prices in the relevant jurisdictions.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
Certain comparative amounts shown in the analysis of deferred tax by category of temporary differences have been reclassified.

The aggregate amount of taxable temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, forwhich deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised, is approximately $5m 2013: $6m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of thesedifferences either because no liability is expected to arise on distribution under applicable tax legislation or because the Group is in a position tocontrol the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
As at 31 December 2014, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $2m 2013: $10m.
