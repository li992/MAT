Retirement benefit plans Background The group has both dened benefit and dened contribution retirement benefit plans.
The groups main plans are in the UK and the largest by membership is the BT Pension Scheme BTPS which is a dened benefit plan that was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001.
After that date new entrants have been able to join a dened contribution plan, currently the BT Retirement Saving Scheme BTRSS, a contract based arrangement.
Dened contribution plans A dened contribution plan is a pension arrangement under which the benets are linked to contributions paid, the performance of each individuals chosen investments and the annuity rates at retirement.
Contributions are paid into an independently administered fund.
The income statement charge in respect of dened contribution plans represents the contribution payable by the group based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The company has no exposure to investment and other experience risks.
Dened benefit plans A dened benefit plan is a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the plan rules dependent on factors such as age, years of service and pensionable pay and is not dependent upon actual contributions made by the company or members.
The income statement service cost in respect of dened benefit plans represents the increase in the dened benefit liability arising from pension benets earned by active members in the current period.
The company is exposed to investment and other experience risks and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benets will not be met from regular contributions, expected investment income and assets held.

c The actuarial gain or loss arises from changes in the assumptions used to value the defined benefit liabilities at the end of the year compared with the assumptions used at the start of the year.
This includes both financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the year end, and demographic assumptions such as life expectancy.
d The actuarial loss or gain arising from experience adjustments on defined benefit liabilities represents the impact on the liabilities of differences between actual experience during the year compared with the assumptions made at the start of the year.
Such differences might arise, for example, from members choosing different benefit options at retirement, actual salary increases being different from those assumed or actual benefit increases being higher than the long-term inflation assumption.

Retirement benefit plans continued BTPS At 31 March 2014 there were 313,000 members of the BTPS.
Members belong to one of three sections depending upon the date they first joined the scheme.
Section A is for members who joined before 1 December 1971, Section B is for members who joined the scheme between 1 December 1971 and 31 March 1986 and Section C is for members who joined the scheme on or after 1 April 1986 but before the scheme closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001.
The membership is analysed below.

Since 1 April 2009, when changes to member benets and contribution rates were introduced, BTPS members have accrued benets based upon a career average re-valued earnings CARE basis and a normal pensionable age of 65.
On a CARE basis benets are built up based upon earnings in each year and the benefit accrued for each year is increased by the lower of ination or the individuals actual pay increase in each year to retirement.
Benets earned for pensionable service prior to 1 April 2009 are based upon a members final salary and a normal pensionable age of 60.
Under the scheme rules the determination of the rate of ination for statutory minimum rates of revaluation and indexation of benets is based upon either the Retail Prices Index RPI or the Consumer Prices Index CPI which apply to each category of member as shown below.

Management of the scheme BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited the Trustee has been appointed by BT as an independent Trustee to administer and manage the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the Trust Deed there are nine Trustee directors all of whom are appointed by BT.
The chairman of the Trustee is appointed after consultation with, and with the agreement of, the relevant trade unions who are also responsible for nominating four directors to act as representatives of the members.
Of the remaining four directors, two will normally hold senior positions within the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualied candidate at least one of the Trustee directors should be a current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS.
Trustee directors are appointed for a three-year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment.

Retirement benefit plans continued BTPS assets Asset allocation The target allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the Trustees investment policy.
The targets set reect the Trustees views on the appropriate balance to be struck between seeking returns and incurring risk, and on the extent to which the assets should be distributed to match liabilities.
Current market conditions and trends are regularly assessed and shortterm tactical shifts in asset allocation may be made around the long-term target.
The BTPS also uses financial instruments to balance the asset allocation and to manage ination risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
Under IAS 19 Revised 2011 plan assets must be valued at the bid market value at the balance sheet date.
For the main asset categories securities listed on recognised stock exchanges are valued at closing bid prices properties are valued on the basis of open market value unlisted equities are valued in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEVC guidelines unlisted xed interest and index-linked instruments are valued using the latest market price or using discounted cash ow models that consider credit risk.
The fair value of the assets of the BTPS analysed by asset category are shown below.
These are subdivided by assets that have a quoted market price in an active market and those that do not such as investment funds.

Retirement benefit plans continued BTPS liabilities under IAS 19 Revised 2011 Valuation methodology The liabilities of the BTPS are measured as the present value of the estimated future benefit cash ows to be paid by the scheme, calculated using the projected unit credit method.
These calculations are performed for the company by a professionally qualied independent actuary.
The expected future benefit payments are based on a number of assumptions including future ination, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and are therefore inherently uncertain.
Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed, or take a greater or lesser cash lump sum at retirement.
The estimated duration of BTPS liabilities, which is an indicator of the weighted average term of the liabilities, is 15 years 2012 13: 15 years although the benets payable by the BTPS are expected to be paid over more than 80 years as shown in the graph below.
Whilst benefit payments are expected to increase over the earlier years, the expected value of the liabilities will reduce.
Key assumptions IAS 19 Revised 2011 The key financial assumptions used to measure the liabilities of the BTPS under IAS 19 Revised 2011 are shown below.
a Nominal rates per year Real rates per year 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 At 31 March % %% % %% Rate used to discount liabilities 4.25 4.20 4.95 0.97 0.87 1.84 Ination increase in RPI 3.25 3.30 3.05 b b c b b c Ination increase in CPI 2.50 2.55 2.30 0.75 0.75 0.75 a The real rate is calculated relative to RPI inflation and is shown as a comparator.
b Assumed to be 0.45% lower after 31 March 2016. c Assumed to be 0.45% lower after 31 March 2015.
Rate used to discount liabilities IAS 19 Revised 2011 requires that the discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds.
The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the pension obligations.
The discount rate at 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 is based on a market-based AA corporate bond yield curve allowing for the future expected benefit payments from the BTPS.
a Forecast benets payable by the BTPS a Liabilities Notes to the consolidated financial statements 75 18.
Retirement benefit plans continued Ination increases in RPI and CPI Salary increases are assumed to be aligned with RPI ination whilst benets are assumed to increase by either RPI or CPI ination as prescribed by the rules of the BTPS and summarised above.
The assumption for RPI has been assessed by reference to yields on long-term xed and index-linked Government bonds and Bank of England published inationary expectations.
CPI is assessed at a margin below RPI taking into account market forecasts and independent estimates of the long-term difference, such as the Ofce of Budgetary Responsibilitys analysis indicating a long-term difference of between 1.3% to 1.5%.
Longevity The average life expectancy assumptions, after retirement at 60 years of age, are as follows.
2014 2013 Number of Number of At 31 March years years Male in lower pay bracket 26.0 25.9 Male in higher pay bracket 27.7 27.6 Female 28.5 28.4 Average improvement for a member retiring at age 60 in 10 years time 1.0 1.0 The assumptions about life expectancy have regard to information published by the UK actuarial professions Continuous Mortality Investigation.
However, due to the size of the membership of the BTPS it is considered appropriate for the adopted life expectancy assumptions to take into account the actual membership experience of the scheme.
Allowance is also made for future improvements in mortality.
The BTPS actuary undertakes formal reviews of the membership experience at every triennial valuation.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure BTPS liabilities The assumptions on the discount rate, ination, salary increases and life expectancy all have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the IAS 19 Revised 2011 pension liability at 31 March 2014, and of the income statement charge for 2014 15, to changes in these assumptions.
Decrease increase in Decrease Decrease net interest increase in increase in on pensions liability service cost deficit bn m m 0.25 percentage point increase to: discount rate 1.6 10 55 ination rate assuming RPI, CPI and salary increases all move by 0.25 percentage points 1.3 10 55 CPI ination rate assuming RPI and salary increases are unchanged 0.8 5 35 salary increases assuming RPI and CPI are unchanged 0.2 5 10 Additional one year increase to life expectancy 1.0 5 40 BTPS funding Triennial funding valuation The triennial valuation is carried out for the Trustee by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that the scheme has sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments.
The latest funding valuation was performed as at 30 June 2011.
The next funding valuation will have an effective date of no later than 30 June 2014.
The valuation methodology for funding purposes, which is based on prudent assumptions, is broadly as follows: assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and liabilities are measured on an actuarial funding basis using the projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value.

Retirement benefit plans continued The results of the two most recent triennial valuations which have been performed using the same methodology are shown below.
June December 2011 2008 valuation valuation bn bn BTPS liabilities 40.8 40.2 Market value of BTPS assets 36.9 31.2 Funding deficit 3.9 9.0 Percentage of accrued benets covered by BTPS assets at valuation date 90.4% 77.6% Percentage of accrued benets on a solvency basis covered by the BTPS assets at the valuation date 66.0% 57.0% The reduction of the funding deficit in the period from 31 December 2008 to 30 June 2011 reects an increase in scheme assets due to deficit contribution payments totalling 1.6bn and strong investment performance of 10.1% per year.
The liabilities increased due to a lower discount rate which was partly offset by the impact of the announcement in July 2010 by the Government that CPI, rather than RPI, will be used as the basis for determining the rate of ination for the statutory minimum rate of revaluation and indexation of occupational pension rights.
Key assumptions funding valuation These valuations were determined using the following prudent long-term assumptions.

Retirement benefit plans continued Future funding obligations and recovery plan Under the terms of the Trust Deed, the group is required to have a funding plan, determined at the conclusion of the triennial funding valuation, which is a legal agreement between BT and the independent Trustee and should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years.
In May 2012, the 2011 triennial funding valuation was nalised, agreed with the Trustee and certied by the Scheme Actuary.
The funding deficit at 30 June 2011 was 3.9bn.
Under the associated recovery plan BT made payments of 2.0bn in March 2012, 325m in March 2013 and 325m in March 2014.
BT will make deficit payments of 295m in each year from 2015 to 2021.
The valuation in addition determined that the ordinary contributions rate required to meet the benets of current employed members reduced to 13.5% of pensionable salaries including employee contributions from 13.6% with effect from 1 June 2012.
The valuation documentation has been submitted to the Pensions Regulator for review.
The final Court decision in the Crown Guarantee case, after any appeals, will give greater clarity as to the extent to which the liabilities of the BTPS are covered by the Crown Guarantee.
This will inform the Pensions Regulators next steps with regard to the valuation of the scheme.
Other protections The 2011 funding agreement with the Trustee included additional features for BT to provide support to the scheme: in the event that net cumulative shareholder distributions exceed cumulative pension deficit contributions over the period from 1 March 2012 to 30 June 2015 then BT will make additional matching contributions to the scheme.
Shareholder distributions include dividends and the cost of share buybacks excluding any possible buybacks associated with existing employee share plans after deducting any proceeds from the issue of shares.
BT will consult with the Trustee if it considers making a special dividend or embarking on a share buyback programme excluding any possible buybacks associated with existing employee share plans.
These provisions apply until the finalisation of the next valuation or 30 June 2015 at the latest in the event that BT generates net cash proceeds greater than 1bn from disposals and acquisitions in any year to 30 June then BT will make additional contributions to the scheme equal to one third of those net cash proceeds.
BT will consult with the Trustee if it considers making acquisitions with a total cost of more than 1bn in any 12-month period.
These provisions apply until the nalisation of the next valuation or 30 September 2015 at the latest a negative pledge that provides protection that future creditors will not be granted superior security to the scheme in excess of a 1.5bn threshold.
This provision applies until the deficit reduces below 2.0bn at any subsequent funding valuation in addition, in order to provide greater certainty, BT has committed to a schedule of future potential payments based upon a range of deficits at the next triennial valuations at 2014 and 2017.
These payments would be in addition to the remaining deficit payments of 295m per year under the 2011 recovery plan and would have a maximum value of around 3.6bn in 2014 and 3.0bn in 2017 based on 2011 discount rates.
At the 2014 valuation, the remaining 2011 recovery plan will be worth about 1.7bn based on 2011 discount rates.
If the deficit agreed at the 2014 valuation exceeds this level, BT will provide extra payments in addition to the remaining 295m annual deficit payments under the 2011 recovery plan.
The amounts payable are dependent on the level of the deficit as shown in the table below.
Additional contributions payable 2015 2016 2017 m m m deficit above remaining 2011 recovery plan present value nil 1.0bn 199 205 211 2.0bn 273 282 289 2.9bn or above 360 371 381 At deficit levels between these values the level of additional contributions is scaled accordingly.
At a level of 2.9bn or above these are the maximum additional contributions under the terms of this agreement.
A new agreement would cover additional contributions if these are required.
A similar mechanism applies based on the deficit agreed at the 2017 valuation.
If this exceeds the outstanding recovery plan with the remaining 2011 recovery plan worth about 1.1bn in 2017, based on 2011 discount rates, BT will provide extra payments dependent on the level of the deficit as shown in the table below.
