The recoverable amount of each CGU is the higher of its value in use VIU or its net realisable value NRV.
The key assumptions for the VIU calculations are those regarding expected cash flows arising in future periods, regional growth rates and the discount rates.
Future cash flow projections are based on the most recent Board approved financial budgets which are used to project cash flows for the next five years.
After this period a steady state cash flow is used to derive a terminal value for the CGU.
Goodwill has an indefinite life and this is reflected in the calculation of the CGUs terminal value.
Estimated average growth rates, based on each regions constituent country growth rates as published by the World Bank, are used to estimate cash flows after the budgeted period.
As at 31 December 2014 VIU has been used to estimate recoverable amounts for all CGUs and for all CGUs except Brazil, the estimate of the recoverable amount was higher than the carrying value.
The calculations have been subject to stress tests demonstrating that the impairment test results are tolerant to reasonably possible changes in assumptions as to discount rate and future cash flows.
The VIU calculations used growth rates of 2% for Europe and the Middle East, 2.5% for North America, and 3% for Asia.
Resultant cash flows for Europe and the Middle East, and Asia have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 10.5% 2013: 11.5%, and for North America have been discounted at 12.5% 2013: 13.5% reflecting the higher level of uncertainty in the forecasts of that CGUs future cash flows.
The estimated recoverable amount for the Brazil CGU using VIU was calculated to be lower than that CGUs carrying value.
Market conditions in Brazil have been challenging in the last two years and revenue has fallen by nearly one quarter since 2012.
The business continues to be profitable but the absolute level of operating profit has fallen below the level required to support the CGUs carrying value.
The recoverable amount based on its NRV was calculated to be higher than its VIU although still lower than its carrying value, and 6.8m has been recognised as an impairment of the goodwill attributed to that CGU.

The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
None of the Groups financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
In respect of trade receivables, the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk to a single counterparty or any group of counterparties.
Matched Principal brokerage transactions, whereby securities are bought from one counterparty and sold to another counterparty, are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
The above analysis reflects only the receivable side of such transactions, the other side being shown in trade and other payables.
Settlement of such transactions typically takes place within a few business days according to the relevant market rules and conventions and the credit risk is considered to be minimal.

Share-based payments Share option awards As at 31 December 2014 the Group had one active equity-based long term incentive plan, the Tullett Prebon Long Term Incentive Plan, for the granting of non-transferable awards to certain employees and executives.
Option awards granted under the plan typically become exercisable three years after grant date.
The exercise of certain options is dependent on option holders meeting performance criteria.
The maximum life of the options is 10 years after grant date.
Options are settled in equity once exercised.

Further deferred consideration with an estimated fair value of 5.8m, payable in shares or cash at the Groups discretion, is payable in 2017.
Intangible assets arising on the consolidation of PVM amounted to 61.2m of which 51.7m relates to goodwill.
Acquisition costs of 1.8m have been included in administrative expenses and 1.4m of equity issue costs have been charged against the merger reserve in equity.
This transaction has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.

Had PVM been acquired on 1 January 2014 revenue would have been 68.7m higher, underlying operating profit 11.4m higher and underlying earnings 8.8m higher.
As part of the acquisition of PVM, certain former shareholders are eligible to receive additional payments after three years service provided they remain as employees and PVM achieves revenue performance targets over that period.
The Group has the sole right to issue equity or cash to satisfy these additional payments, which although deferred consideration in substance, are conditional on future employment, and the fair value of the payments as at the date of acquisition, which was estimated to be US$48.0m 30.6m, is being recognised as a share-based expense, through the income statement and equity, over the three year service term.
The share-based expense recognised in future periods will be adjusted to reflect actual service and revenue performance.

Consideration of US$5.6m 3.6m was paid in cash.
Deferred consideration with a fair value of US$0.8m 0.5m is payable over a five year period subject to earnings targets.
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were negligible, resulting in the recognition of goodwill of US$6.4m 4.1m, attributable to the highly skilled workforce and the businesss reputation.
Given the nature of the acquisition it is impracticable to show the revenue and earnings for the full year as if acquired from the beginning of the year.

The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables and allow for future mortality improvements and are the same as those adopted for the 2013 funding valuation.
Assumptions for the Scheme are that a member who retires in 15 years time at age 60 will live on average for a further 31.2 years 2013: 31.1 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 32.6 years 2013: 32.5 years after retirement if they are female.
Current pensioners are assumed to have a generally shorter life expectancy based on their current age.
The valuation of the Scheme liabilities is sensitive to changes in the assumptions used.
The effect of changes in the discount rate, inflation and mortality assumptions, assuming an independent change in one assumption with all others held constant, on the liabilities is shown below: Scheme Scheme assets liabilities Surplus deficit m m m As at 31 December 2014 255.7 193.6 62.1 Following a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate Change 0% 4.6% 14.3% New value 255.7 202.5 53.2 Following a 0.25% increase in the inflation assumption Change 0% 2.3% 7.1% New value 255.7 198.0 57.7 Life expectancy increases by 3 years Change 0% 6.6% 20.6% New value 255.7 206.4 49.3 Note: The above analysis does not reflect any inter-relationship between the assumptions.
Changes to the risks inherent in the Scheme would result in changes to the Schemes carrying value.
The most significant risks are: investment performance the liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set by reference to bond yields.
If assets underperform this yield, this would result in the carrying value of the Scheme reducing: changes in bond yields a decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities: inflation risk some of the Schemes liabilities are linked to inflation, and higher inflation would lead to higher liabilities mitigated by a cap on the level of inflationary increases which protects against extreme inflationary increases : and life expectancy the majority of the Schemes obligations are for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
