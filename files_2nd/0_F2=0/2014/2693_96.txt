They also include deferred income which is amounts we have billed to our customers where we have yet to provide the service.

3.4 Impairment review Impairment occurs when the carrying value of an asset or group of assets is greater than the present value of the cash they are expected to generate.
We perform annual impairment reviews of the carrying value of goodwill.
We consider the carrying value of other assets at least annually.
If there are triggers that indicate an impairment of other assets is possible, we then perform a full impairment review.
No impairment charges were recorded in 2013 14.
