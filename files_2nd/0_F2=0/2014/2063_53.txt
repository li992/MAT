The costs in respect of these awards are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based onthefair value of the shares and options at the award date.

The costs in respect of these awards are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based on the fair value of the shares and options at the award date, adjusted for the probability of market-related performance conditions being achieved.
The fair value of shares and options awarded during the year is estimated using a Monte Carlo projection model with the following assumptions: share price on date of issue of 12.11 2013: 12.71, exercise price of nil 2013: nil, a risk-free rate of 1.20% 2013:0.81% and a vesting period of three years 2013: three years.
The model also contains assumptions for both the Group and each member oftheindustry peer group set out on page 69 in respect of volatility, average share price growth and share price correlation.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the share price over the previous three-year period.
Share price correlation was determined bycalculating the historical correlation of the share price over the previous three-year period.
Average share price growth was determined from historicalgrowth over the previous year.
The fair value of shares and options awarded during the year was 4.73 per share 2013: 6.13 per share.
