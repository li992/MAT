Goodwill continued The impact of changes in key assumptions on the impaired CGUs is as follows: Health: The CGU represents the UK healthcare market segment.
A 2% increase in the discount rate gives rise to an additional impairment of 16m and a 1% decline in the terminal growth rate leads to an additional impairment of 7m.
If there were both a 2% increase in the discount rate and a 1% decline in the terminal growth rates an additional impairment charge of 19m would occur.
The removal of half of uncontracted future cash flows creates an additional impairment of 34m, if all other assumptions remain unchanged.
Local Services: Includes services provided to local authorities in respect of leisure, environmental and facilities management, both in the UK and in Europe.
A 2% increase in the discount rate leads to a 4m impairment in the current goodwill balance on the remaining Local Services CGU, while a 1% decline in terminal growth impairs the balance by 2m.
If both assumptions were to move adversely, a total impairment of 6m would arise.
If half of uncontracted future cash flows were not to be achieved, 17m of the goodwill balance is impaired.
Global Services: The CGU is a single reportable segments as defined by IFRS 8 Operating segments and due to the expected sale of a significant portion of the business, the impairment charge is limited by the estimated sales proceeds and therefore a reasonably possible adverse movement in the key assumptions has no impact on the impairment of this CGU, including uncontracted revenues.
Americas: If the terminal growth rate were to fall by 1%, the impairment charge would increase by 39m, whereas a 2% increase in the discount rate results in an additional impairment charge of 86m.
If both assumptions moved adversely by these rates, the impairment charge would increase by 107m.
This CGU is also a single reporting segment.
The removal of half of uncontracted future cash flows creates an additional impairment of 28m, if all other assumptions remain unchanged.

Following the progress made on the review of the Groups strategic direction and a review of the balance sheet position following a downturn in performance, a significant level of impairment has been charged.
Significant items included within the impairment charge relate to: impairment of customer relationships in Global Services and AsPac following the change in markets of focus for the Group: impairment of certain assets developed as tools and customer solutions for Global Services which are no longer expected to obtain the level of benefits originally expected: and impairment of certain software, both internally generated and outright purchased, across the business due to abandonment.
Customer relationships are amortised over the average length of contracts acquired.
The Group is carrying 40.5m 2013: 67.6m in relation to Customer relationships.
A further 0.2m 2013: nil is held within assets reclassified to held for sale.
Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition consists of amortisation in relation to Customer relationships and Licences and franchises and totals 11.4m 2013: 21.4m.
The value of internally generated intangible assets as at 31 December 2014 was approximately 31.7m 2013: 44.6m in development expenditure and 43.1m 2013: 60.4m in software and IT, of which 2.5m 2013: nil is classified as held for sale.
