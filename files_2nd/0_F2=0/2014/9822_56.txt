Notes continued For the 52 weeks ended 4 October 2014 26 Share-based payments During the period there were two classes of equity-settled employee share incentive plans outstanding: a Save As You Earn SAYE.
Under this scheme employees enter into a savings contract for a period of three to seven years and options are granted on commencement of the contract, exercisable using the amount saved under the contract at the time it terminates.
Options under the scheme are granted at a discount of 20% to the market price of the shares at the time of the invitation and are not subject to performance conditions.
Exercise of options is subject to continued employment.
b Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Under this scheme nil cost options are granted that will only vest provided the participant satisfies the minimum shareholding requirement and performance conditions relating to earnings per share, return on capital, free cash flow and relative total shareholder return, as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 34, are met.
In 2010, HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved an Approved Performance Share Plan APSP to enable participants in the LTIP to benefit from UK tax efficiencies.
As such, awards made in 2010 and subsequent years comprise an HMRC approved option in respect of the first 30,000 worth of an award and an unapproved LTIP award for amounts in excess of this HMRC limit.
A further share award a linked award is also provided to enable participants to fund the exercise of the approved option.
This linked award is satisfied by way of shares from the Companys Employee Benefit Trust but these additional shares are not generally delivered to the participant.
Under these rules the LTIP options are still issued at nil cost to the employee.
The tables below summarise the outstanding share options.
