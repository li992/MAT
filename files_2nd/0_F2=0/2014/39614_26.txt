Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent: State that the Group has complied with IFRS as adopted by the EU, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.

In addition, the Board considers that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Companys performance, business model and strategy.
By Order of the Board Moya Greene Matthew Lester Chief Executive Officer Chief Finance Officer 6 June 2014 Royal Mail plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 127 Independent Auditors Report to the members of Royal Mail plc We have audited the financial statements of Royal Mail plc for the period ended 30 March 2014 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Consolidated balance sheet, the Consolidated statement of cash flows statement and the related notes 1 to 29.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Companys members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor As explained more fully in the statement of Directors responsibilities set out on page 127, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland.
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Group financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors: and the overall presentation of the Group financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 2014 to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements In our opinion the Group financial statements: Give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups affairs as at 30 March 2014 and of its profit for the period then ended: Have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union: and Have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement We identified the following risks that have had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy: the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team: Revenue recognition across the Groups operations, specifically in relation to the accounting for stamps and meters deferred revenue and the risk of management override: Accounting and valuation of the Groups pension scheme: and Completeness and measurement of the Groups provisions, including the recognition of severance provisions and industrial diseases claims.
Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements.
For the purposes of determining whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person, relying on the financial statements, would be changed or influenced.
We also determine a level of performance materiality which we use to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be material for thefinancial statements as a whole.
We determined planning materiality for the Group to be 27.0 million, which is approximately 5 per cent ofadjusted profit before tax 2013: 0.5 per cent of revenue.
This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment, our judgement is that overall performance materiality for the Group should be 75 per cent of planning materiality, namely 20.3 million.
Our objective in adopting this approach is to ensure that total detected and undetected audit differences do not exceed our planning materiality of 27.0 million for the financial statements as whole.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all adjusted and unadjusted audit differences in excess of 1.4 million.
We also agreed to report differences below those thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Royal Mail plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 128 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information An overview of the scope of our audit Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, we selected eleven components which represent the principal business units within the Groups reportable segments and account for 95 per cent of the Groups revenue and 99 per cent of the Groups profit before tax.
Two of these components were subject to a full audit, four were subject to audits of specific account balances and five were subject to review procedures.
For the remaining components, we performed other procedures to confirm there were no significant risks of material misstatement in the Group financial statements.
The audit work for some of the locations and the statutory audits were executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were much lower than Group materiality.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor or his designate visits each of the two full scope locations at least once a year.
This year, the Group audit team visited the UK and overseas full scope locations.
For all full scope entities, the Group audit team reviewed key working papers and participated in the component teams planning including the component teams discussion of fraud and error.
Our response to the risks of material misstatement included the following procedures: We performed controls testing over revenue recognition, including the timing of revenue recognition, challenged managements underlying assumptions and methodology used in its stamps and meters deferred revenue calculations, as well as assessing whether the revenue recognition policies adopted complied with IFRSs.
We performed analytical procedures and journal entry testing in order to identify and test the risk of fraud arising from management override of controls: Using the knowledge and expertise of our own actuarial specialists, we challenged managements key assumptions and estimates used in its pension accounting to evaluate the appropriateness of the methodology.
We also considered whether the Groups pension disclosures are appropriate and in accordance with IFRSs: and We reviewed the Groups provisions to understand the appropriateness of assumptions supporting managements estimates, challenging managements accounting treatment and disclosures.
We also assessed the completeness of the Groups provisions and contingent liabilities and compliance with IFRSs recognition and measurement criteria.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion: The information given in the Strategic report and the Directors report for the financial period for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements: and The part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception We have nothing to report in respect of the following: Under the ISAs UK and Ireland, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is: Materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements: or Apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit: or Is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit & Risk Committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: Returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us, or The part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and return, or Certain disclosures of Directors remuneration specified by law are not made: or We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
