173 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2014 38 Acquisitions If all the acquisitions in the year had been completed on 1st April 2013 the revenue for the group would have been 11,155.8 million and its profit for the year 338.6 million.
On 16th August 2013 the group acquired the business of Biomedical Technologies, Inc. BTI, a small niche life science company.
Its acquisition should be an enabler for growing Research Chemicals life science product range.
The goodwill arising is attributable to opportunities expected by integrating BTIs product range into Research Chemicals existing distribution network and utilising Research Chemicals sales and marketing capability.
On 8th October 2013 the group acquired the ion exchange business of Purity Systems Incorporated PSI.
Its acquisition will enable the group to access novel silica polymer composite resin technology.
These resins can selectively remove and recycle base metals and other contaminant metals from industrial processes and effluent streams.
The goodwill arising is attributable to synergies arising from the potential to apply the learning from this technology to other existing Johnson Matthey products to improve their manufacture and performance.
On 28th March 2014 the group acquired the vinyl chloride monomer VCM process technology and business from Jacobs Process BV.
Through this acquisition the group now has full ownership of the technology and plans to develop an updated plant flowsheet which will enhance the groups opportunities in the growing market for VCM.
The goodwill arising is attributable to these significant opportunities.
As part of the transaction 0.8 million was paid in exchange for the vendors commitment to provide professional services in the future.
This has been excluded from the numbers below and accounted for as a prepayment.
The fair value of the net assets acquired, consideration paid, goodwill arising on these transactions, acquisition-related expenses and contribution to the groups results since acquisition were: BTI PSI VCM million million million Net assets acquired Intangible assets 0.9 1.2 5.1 Inventories 0.1 Trade and other receivables 0.1 Provisions 0.1 Total net assets acquired 1.0 1.2 5.1 Goodwill on acquisition 0.5 0.3 2.4 1.5 1.5 7.5 Satisfied by Purchase consideration cash 1.4 0.6 7.5 Purchase consideration deferred 0.1 0.9 1.5 1.5 7.5 Acquisition-related costs charged to administrative expenses 0.1 0.1 0.1 Revenue since acquisition 0.3 0.1 Profit loss since acquisition 0.1 0.2 Trade and other receivables gross contractual amounts receivable 0.1 All the goodwill arising on acquisitions made in the year is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
On 27th March 2013 the group acquired Formox AB, its Chinese subsidiary and its business in USA.
At 31st March 2013 the fair value of the consideration and the fair value of the net assets acquired were provisional as the completion accounts had yet to be agreed with the vendor.
During the year the completion accounts were agreed, 1.5 million refunded and the fair values finalised.
This resulted in goodwill being reduced and inventories increased by 0.5 million.
