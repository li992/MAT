Our Financials Group Notes Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting Policies Basis of preparation The Annual Report and Accounts of IP Group plc IP Group or the Company and its subsidiary companies together, the Group are for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.
The policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and Interpretations collectively IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in the most appropriate selection of the Groups accounting policies.
The areas where significant judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in note 3.
Changes in accounting policies i New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from 1 January 2014 Amendment to IFRS 10 Investment Entities: The amendments define an investment entity and require a parent that is an investment entity to measure its investments in particular subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss, rather than consolidating them in its consolidated financial statements.
Measurement at fair value through profit or loss must also be applied to an investment entitys separate financial statements.
The amendments also introduce disclosure requirements for investment entities into IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and amend IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements.
The Group, after examination, does not qualify for the investment entity exemption and consequently the amendment has not resulted in changes to the preparation and presentation of the Groups subsidiaries, associates or Limited Partnerships.
No other new standards, interpretations and amendments effective for the first time from 1 January 2014 have had a material effect on the Groups financial statements.
ii New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective The following new standards, which have not been applied in these financial statements, will or may have an effect on the Groups future financial statements: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 15 was issued on 28 May 2014 and provides a single global standard on revenue recognition which aligns the IFRS and US GAAP guidance.
It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
The Group has assessed the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS 15 and does not foresee any material effect when the Standard is applied.
While early adoption is permitted, IFRS 15 has an effective date of 1 January 2017 with the year ending 31 December 2017 being the first annual financial statements to which the standard applies.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 9 will eventually replace IAS 39 in its entirety.
The process has been divided into three main components, being classification and measurement: impairment: and hedge accounting.
The Group provisionally assesses the potential effect to be immaterial given the majority of its financial assets are currently held at fair value through profit or loss.
The previous effective date of 1 January 2015 has been withdrawn and is now expected to be implemented in 2018.
None of the other new standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective is expected to have a material effect on the Groups future financial statements.
Basis of consolidation i Business Combinations The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method from the date that control is transferred to the Group see ii Subsidiaries below.
Both the identifiable net assets and the consideration transferred in the acquisition are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition and transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is tested annually for impairment.
In instances where the Group owns a non-controlling stake prior to acquisition the step acquisition method is applied, and any gain or losses on the fair value of the pre-acquisition holding is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
ii Subsidiaries Where the Group has control over an entity, it is classified as a subsidiary.
As per IFRS 10 an entity is classed as under the control of the Group when all three of the following elements are present: power over the entity, exposure to variable returns from the entity and the ability of the Group to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
com 91 23830.04 Proof 7 1-04-2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued In situations where the Company has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee without holding the majority of the voting rights, it considered that fide facto control exists.
In determining whether fide facto control exists the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including: The size of the Companys voting rights relative to both the size and dispersion of other parties who hold voting rights: Substantive potential voting rights held by the company and by other parties: Other contractual arrangements: and Historic patterns in voting attendance.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method.
In the statement of financial position, the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
They are consolidated until the date on which control ceases.
iii Associates Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not control, generally accompanied by a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
No associates are presented on the statement of financial position as the Group elects to hold such investments at fair value in the statement of financial position.
This treatment is permitted by IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures, which permits investments held by entities that are akin to venture capital organisations to be excluded from its scope where those investments are designated, upon initial recognition, as at fair value through profit or loss and accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Changes in fair value of associates are recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change.
The Group has no interests in associates through which it carries on its business.
iv Limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships Limited Partnerships Limited partnerships Group entities act as general partner and investment manager to the following limited partnerships: Interest in limited partnership Name % IP Venture Fund II L. P. IPVFII 33.3 IP Venture Fund IPVF 10.0 The North East Technology Fund L. P. NETF The Group receives compensation for its role as investment manager to these limited partnerships including fixed fees and performance fees.
The Directors consider that these amounts are in substance and form normal market rate compensation for its role as investment manager.
In order to determine whether these limited partnerships were required to be consolidated, the presence of the three elements of control noted in part ii was examined.
The Groups significant stake in IPVFII creates a significant exposure to the variability of returns from those interests and the Groups ability to direct the operations of the fund would result in IP Group obtaining the benefits of its activities.
As such IPVFII meets the criteria in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and is consequently consolidated.
In the case of IPVF, the Directors consider that the minority limited partnership interest does not create an exposure of such significance that it indicates that the Group acts as anything other than agent for the other limited partners in the arrangement.
This is further supported by the presence of a strict investment policy and the inability for the general partner to change the restrictive terms of that policy other than with agreement of 100% of IPVFs limited partners.
Similarly, the lack of a stake in NETF indicates the Groups role as an agent for the limited partner.
As a result, the Directors consider that the Group does not have the power to govern the operations of theses limited partnerships so as to obtain benefits from their activities and accordingly do not meet the definition of a subsidiary under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
However the Group does have the power to exercise significant influence over its limited partnerships and accordingly the Groups accounting treatment for the interest in IPVF is consistent with that of associates as described earlier in this report, i. e. in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 92 23830.04 Proof 7 1-04-2015 Our Financials Group Notes Our Financials Group Notes Limited liability partnerships The Group has a 17.8% interest in the total capital commitments of Technikos LLP Technikos.
The general partner and investment manager of Technikos are parties external to the Group.
v Non-controlling interests The total comprehensive income, assets and liabilities of non-wholly owned subsidiaries are attributed to owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests.
Portfolio return and revenue Change in fair value Change in fair value of equity and debt investments represents revaluation gains and losses on the Groups portfolio of investments.
Gains on disposal of equity investments represent the difference between the fair value of consideration received and the carrying value at the start of the accounting period on the disposal of equity investments.
Change in fair value of limited partnership investments represents revaluation gains and losses on the Groups investments in limited partnership funds.
Changes in fair values of assets do not constitute revenue.
Revenue from services and other income All revenue from services is generated within the United Kingdom and is stated exclusive of value added tax.
Revenue from services and other income comprises: Advisory fees: Fees earned from the provision of business support services are recognised as the related services are provided.
Corporate finance advisory fees are generally earned as a fixed percentage of total funds raised and recognised at the time the related transaction is successfully concluded.
Fund management services: Fiduciary fund management fees are generally earned as a fixed percentage of total funds under management and are recognised as the related services are provided.
Licence Income: Income from licensing and similar income is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the terms of the relevant licensing agreements.
Income from milestone income is recognised once performance obligations are satisfied, on an accruals basis and in accordance with the terms of the relevant licensing agreements.
Dividends: Dividends receivable from equity shares are included within other portfolio income and recognised on the ex-dividend date or, where no ex-dividend date is quoted, are recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life, as follows: Fixtures and fittings Over 3 to 5 years Computer equipment Over 3 to 5 years The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets and allocated from the acquisition date to each of the Groups cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
Goodwill may be allocated to CGUs in both the acquired business and in the existing business.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets represents contractual arrangements and memorandums of understanding with four UK universities acquired through acquisition of a subsidiary.
At the date of acquisition the cost of these intangibles as a share of the larger acquisition was calculated and subsequently the assets are held at amortised cost.
Impairment of intangible assets including goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairments, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows i. e. CGUs.
com 93 23830.04 Proof 7 1-04-2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Financial assets In respect of regular way purchases or sales, the Group uses trade date accounting to recognise or derecognise financial assets.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories listed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
None of the Groups financial assets are categorised as held to maturity or available for sale.
i At fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are either financial assets held for trading or financial assets which are designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
This category includes equity investments, debt investments, equity rights, contingent value rights and investments in limited partnerships.
Investments in associated undertakings, which are held by the Group with a view to the ultimate realisation of capital gains, are also categorised as at fair value through profit or loss.
This measurement basis is consistent with the fact that the Groups performance in respect of investments in equity investments, limited partnerships and associated undertakings is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with an established investment strategy.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and any gains or losses arising from subsequent changes in fair value are presented in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income in the period which they arise.
Fair value hierarchy The Group classifies financial assets using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the related fair value measurements.
The level in the fair value hierarchy, within which a financial asset is classified, is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to that assets fair value measurement.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as prices from market transactions.
These are mainly based on prices determined from recent investments in the last twelve months.
Level 3 One or more inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Equity Investments The fair values of quoted investments are based on bid prices in an active market at the reporting date.
The fair value of unlisted securities is established using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis and earnings multiples.
Wherever possible the Group uses valuation techniques which make maximum use of market-based inputs.
Accordingly, the valuation methodology used most commonly by the Group is the price of recent investment contained in the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines the IPEVCV Guidelines endorsed by the British & European Venture Capital Associations.
The following considerations are used when calculating the fair value of unlisted securities: Cost Where the investment being valued was itself made recently, its cost may provide a good indication of fair value unless there is objective evidence that the investment has since been impaired, such as observable data suggesting a deterioration of the financial, technical, or commercial performance of the underlying business.
Price of recent investment The Group considers that fair value estimates, which are based entirely on observable market data, will be of greater reliability than those based on assumptions and, accordingly, where there has been any recent investment by third parties, the price of that investment will generally provide a basis of the valuation.
The length of period for which it remains appropriate to use the price of recent investment depends on the specific circumstances of the investment and the stability of the external environment.
Given the nature of the Groups investments in seed, start-up and early-stage companies, where there are often no current and no short-term future earnings or positive cash flows, it can be difficult to gauge the probability and financial impact of the success or failure of development or research activities and to make reliable cash flow forecasts.
Consequently, the most appropriate approach to determine fair value is a methodology that is based on market data, that being the price of a recent investment.
Where the Group considers that the price of recent investment, unadjusted, is no longer relevant and there are limited or no comparable companies or transactions from which to infer value, the Group carries out an enhanced assessment based on milestone analysis and or industry and sector analysis.
In applying the milestone analysis approach to investments in companies in early or development stages the Group seeks to determine whether there is an indication of change in fair value based on a consideration of performance against any milestones that were set at the time of the original investment decision, as well as taking into consideration the key market drivers of the investee company and the overall economic environment.
IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 94 23830.04 Proof 7 1-04-2015 Our Financials Group Notes Our Financials Group Notes Where the Group considers that there is an indication that the fair value has changed, an estimation is made of the required amount of any adjustment from the last price of recent investment.
Wherever possible, this adjustment is based on objective data from the investee company and the experience and judgement of the Group.
However, any adjustment is, by its very nature, subjective.
Where a deterioration in value has occurred, the Group reduces the carrying value of the investment to reflect the estimated decrease.
If there is evidence of value creation the Group may consider increasing the carrying value of the investment: however, in the absence of additional financing rounds or profit generation it can be difficult to determine the value that a purchaser may place on positive developments given the potential outcome and the costs and risks to achieving that outcome and accordingly caution is applied.
Factors that the Group considers include, inter alia, technical measures such as product development phases and patent approvals, financial measures such as cash burn rate and profitability expectations, and market and sales measures such as testing phases, product launches and market introduction.
Other valuation techniques If there is no readily ascertainable value from following the price of recent investment methodology, or there is objective evidence that a deterioration in fair value has occurred since a relevant transaction, the Group considers alternative methodologies in the IPEVCV Guidelines such as discounted cash flows DCF or price-earnings multiples.
DCF involves estimating the fair value of a business by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows, based on the most recent forecasts in respect of the underlying business.
Given the difficulty of producing reliable cash flow forecasts for seed, start-up and early-stage companies as described earlier, this methodology is generally used as a confirmatory indicator of the level of any adjustment that may need to be made to the last price of recent investment.
When using the earnings multiple methodology, earnings before interest and tax EBIT are generally used, adjusted to a maintainable level.
A suitable earnings multiple is derived from an equivalent business or group of businesses, for which the average price-earnings multiple for the relevant sector index can generally be considered a suitable proxy.
This multiple is applied to earnings to derive an enterprise value which is then discounted by up to 60% for non-marketability and other risks inherent to businesses in early stages of operation.
No reliable estimate Where a fair value cannot be estimated reliably, the investment is reported at the carrying value at the previous reporting date unless there is objective evidence that the investment has since been impaired.
Equity rights The equity rights asset represents consideration paid to the University of Oxford between December 2000 and June 2001 that gives the Group contractual rights to the receipt of shares in unlisted spin-out companies or cash based on research carried out in the universitys Department of Chemistry.
It is considered to be a derivative financial asset and is designated as at fair value through profit and loss.
Further details on the treatment of this asset are included in note 14.
Debt investments Debt investments are generally unquoted debt instruments which are convertible to equity at a future point in time.
Such instruments are considered to be hybrid instruments containing a fixed rate debt host contract with an embedded equity derivative.
The Group designates the entire hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition and, accordingly, the embedded derivative is not separated from the host contract and accounted for separately.
The fair value of debt investments is established by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the instrument.
Contingent value rights In instances where the Group receives contingent financial consideration upon the disposal of a financial asset, the resulting asset shall be recognised and designated as at fair value through profit and loss, and treated accordingly.
ii Loans and receivables These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed and determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise principally through the provision of services to customers trade receivables and are carried at cost less provision for impairment.
Deposits Deposits comprise longer-term deposits held with financial institutions with an original maturity of greater than three months.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and short-term deposits held with financial institutions with an original maturity of three months or less.
com 95 23830.04 Proof 7 1-04-2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are composed of trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are recognised at amortised cost.
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the Groups financial liabilities are a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity if the holders have only a residual interest in the Groups assets after deducting all liabilities.
The objective of the Group is to manage capital so as to provide shareholders with above average returns through capital growth over the medium to long term.
The Group considers its capital to comprise its share capital, share premium, merger reserve and retained earnings.
Top Technology Ventures Limited, a Group subsidiary, is subject to external capital requirements imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and as such must ensure that it has sufficient capital to satisfy these requirements.
The Group ensures it remains compliant with these requirements as described in the financial statements of Top Technology Ventures Limited.
Employee benefits i Pension obligations The Group operates a company defined-contribution pension scheme for which all employees are eligible.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The Group currently makes contributions on behalf of staff to this scheme or to employee personal pension schemes on an individual basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due.
ii Share-based payments The Group engages in equity-settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services receivable from employees, by granting employees conditional awards of ordinary shares subject to certain vesting conditions.
Conditional awards of shares are made pursuant to the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards and or the Groups Annual Incentive Scheme AIS.
The fair value of the shares is estimated at the date of grant, taking into account the terms and conditions of the award, including market-based performance conditions.
The difference between the fair value of the employee services received in respect of the shares granted and the price payable is recognised as an expense over the appropriate performance and vesting period.
The corresponding credit is recognised in retained earnings within total equity.
The fair value of services is calculated using the market value on the date of award and is adjusted for expected and actual levels of vesting.
Where conditional awards of shares lapse the expense recognised to date is credited to the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they lapse.
Where the terms for an equity-settled award are modified, and the modification increases the total fair value of the share-based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee at the date of modification, the incremental fair value is amortised over the vesting period.
Deferred tax Full provision is made for deferred tax on all temporary differences resulting from the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax base.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or deferred tax liability settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the deferred tax asset will be recovered in the future.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Financial Risk Management As set out in the Principal risks and uncertainties section on pages 34 to 39, the Group is exposed, through its normal operations, to a number of financial risks, the most significant of which are market, liquidity and credit risks.
In general, risk management is carried out throughout the Group under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The following further describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 96 23830.04 Proof 7 1-04-2015 Our Financials Group Notes Our Financials Group Notes a Market risk i Price risk The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk as a result of the equity and debt investments, and investments in limited partnerships held by the Group and categorised as at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group mitigates this risk by having established investment appraisal processes and asset monitoring procedures which are subject to overall review by the Board.
The Group has also established corporate finance and communications teams dedicated to supporting portfolio companies with fundraising activities and investor relations.
The Group holds investments which are publicly traded on AIM 18 companies or ISDX 1 company and investments which are not traded on an active market.
The net increase in fair value of the Groups equity and debt investments during 2014 of 20.7m represents a 7% change against the opening balance 2013: net increase of 82.4m, 45% and a similar increase or decrease in the prices of quoted and unquoted investments is considered to be reasonably possible.
The table below summarises the impact of a 1% increase decrease in the price of both quoted and unquoted investments on the Groups post-tax profit for the year and on equity.

The primary impact to the Group is the impact on income and operating cash flow as a result of the interest-bearing deposits and cash and cash equivalents held by the Group.
The Group mitigates this risk, in co-ordination with liquidity risk, by managing its proportion of fixed to floating rate financial assets.
The table below summarises the interest rate profile of the Group.

Financial Risk Management continued b Liquidity risk The Group seeks to manage liquidity risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Groups Treasury Management Policy asserts that at any one point in time no more than 60% of the Groups cash and cash equivalents will be placed in fixed-term deposits with a holding period greater than three months.
Accordingly, the Group only invests working capital in short-term instruments issued by reputable counterparties.
The Group continually monitors rolling cash flow forecasts to ensure sufficient cash is available for anticipated cash requirements.
c Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its deposits, cash and cash equivalents, debt investments and trade receivables.
The Group seeks to mitigate its credit risk on cash and cash equivalents by making short-term deposits with counterparties, or by investing in treasury funds with an AA credit rating or above managed by institutions.
Short-term deposit counterparties are required to have most recently reported total assets in excess of 3bn and, where applicable, a prime short-term credit rating at the time of investment ratings are generally determined by Moodys or Standard & Poors.
Moodys prime credit ratings of P1, P2 and P3 indicate respectively that the rating agency considers the counterparty to have a superior, strong or acceptable ability to repay short-term debt obligations generally defined as having an original maturity not exceeding 13 months.
An analysis of the Groups deposits and cash and cash equivalents balance analysed by credit rating as at the reporting date is shown in the table below.
All other financial assets are unrated.
2014 2013 Credit rating m m P1 68.7 14.2 P2 28.6 9.9 AA Total deposits and cash and cash equivalents 97.3 24.1 The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group has detailed policies and strategies which seek to minimise these associated risks including defining maximum counterparty exposure limits for term deposits based on their perceived financial strength at the commencement of the deposit.
The maximum single counterparty limit for deposits at 31 December 2014 was 25m 2013: 10m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk on debt investments is managed in a similar way to equity price risk, as described earlier, through the Groups investment appraisal processes and asset monitoring procedures which are subject to overall review by the Board.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for debt investments, receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements The Directors make judgements and estimates concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, such as expectations of future events, and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions, which have the most significant effects on the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in the financial statements, are discussed below.
i Valuation of unquoted equity investments The judgements required, in order to determine the appropriate valuation methodology of unquoted equity investments, have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.
These judgements include making assessments of the future earnings potential of portfolio companies, appropriate earnings multiples to apply, and marketability and other risk discounts.
ii Impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount is determined using a number of value-in-use and  calculations.
The use of these methods requires the estimation of future cash flows, and the selection of a suitable discount rate, in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows as well as the selection of applicable and reasonable multiples.
IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 98 23830.04 Proof 7 1-04-2015 Our Financials Group Notes Our Financials Group Notes iii Acquired Intangible Assets At the date of its acquisition by IP Group, Fusion IP had contractual arrangements with four UK universities.
The Group separately recognised each of these contractual arrangements as an intangible asset at its fair value at acquisition date.
As the intangible assets are not quoted on an active market, the fair value at acquisition date was determined by averaging the inflationand venture capital industry activity-adjusted true cost of all university contracts that IP Group was aware of and that have had costs associated with those contracts.
As the contractual agreements are for a finite term, the intangible assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortisation will occur over the remaining term or useful life of each contractual arrangement with each of the four universities.
Discussion of sensitivity analyses is included in the relevant note for each of the above estimates and judgements.
Revenue from Services All revenue from services is derived from either the provision of advisory and venture capital fund management services or the licensing of internally developed therapeutic compounds.
Operating Segments For both the year ended 31 December 2014 and the year ended 31 December 2013, the Groups revenue and profit loss before taxation were derived almost entirely from its principal activities within the UK.
Though the Group has initiated operations in the US, the associated revenues and costs are currently immaterial and accordingly no additional geographical disclosures are given.
For management reporting purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating segments: i the commercialisation of intellectual property via the formation of long-term partner relationships with universities: ii the management of venture funds focusing on early-stage UK technology companies: and iii the in-licensing of drugable intellectual property from research intensive institutions.

Goodwill m At 1 January 2013 18.4 At 1 January 2014 18.4 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiary see note 26 38.7 At 31 December 2014 57.1 The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The goodwill allocated to each CGU is summarised in the table below.
A number of both value-in-use and  calculations are used to assess the recoverable values of the CGUs, details of which are specified below.

For the purposes of impairment testing, the university partnership CGU comprises those elements connected with the Groups university partnership business other than those that specifically relate to the Groups contract with the University of Oxfords Department of Chemistry see note 14.
The Directors consider that for each of the key variables which would be relevant in determining a recoverable value for the university partnership CGU, there is a range of reasonably possible alternative values.
The key variable ranges are set out below: 2014 2013 m m Number of spin-out companies per year 1015 7-10 Annual investment rate 40m60m 20m-35m Rate of return achieved 18%22% 18%-22% Initial equity stake acquired by the Group under the university partnership 15%35% 12%30% Proportion of spin-out companies failing 32%45% 32%45% Weighted average holding period years 35 3-5 Dilution rates prior to exit as a result of financing for spin-out companies 40%60% 40%60% Proportion of IPO exits 25%35% 25%35% IPO exit valuations 30m40m 35m45m Proportion of disposal exits 28%32% 28%32% Disposal valuations 25m35m 25m35m Discount rate 9%11% 9%11% When determining the key variables management has, where possible and appropriate, used historical performance data as a basis.
In instances where the forecasted volumes and scale of activity do not align with the Groups prior performance, management applies its judgement in determining said variables.
A number of different value-in-use models were assessed in order to evaluate the recoverable value of the CGU, none of which resulted in an impairment being required.

The contractual arrangements have fixed terms and, consequently, the intangible assets have a finite life which align with the remaining terms which, at the end of the period, range from two months to 39 months.
The individual contractual arrangements are amortised in a straight line over the remainder of their terms with the expense being presented directly on the primary statements.

In return for the non-refundable, non-interest bearing, advance totalling 20.1m, the Group has the right to receive from the University the following over its 15-year term: 50% of the universitys equity shares in any spin-out company, which is created, based on intellectual property created by academics that are considered to be part of the Department of Chemistry i. e. equity instruments in unlisted companies : and 50% of the universitys share of any cash payments received by the university from parties who have licensed intellectual property created by academics that are considered to be part of the Department of Chemistry.
The contract expires on 23 November 2015.
The Directors consider that for each of the key variables which would be relevant in determining a fair value for this financial instrument, there is a range of reasonably possible alternative values.
The key variable ranges are set out below: 2014 2013 Number of spin-out companies per year from University of Oxfords Department of Chemistry 1 12 Initial equity stake acquired by the Group under the equity rights contract 20%25% 20%25% Proportion of spin-out companies failing 30%40% 30%40% Dilution rates prior to exit as a result of financing for spin-out companies 35%60% 35%60% Proportion of IPO exits 30%40% 30%40% IPO exit valuations 30m50m 30m50m Proportion of disposal exits 25%35% 25%35% Disposal valuations 30m40m 30m40m Discount rate 9%11% 9%11% These key variable ranges result in a wide range of fair value estimates for the equity rights agreement, from nil to 2.9m using a range of reasonably possible variables, with the number of spin-outs being the variable giving rise to the widest variation in estimated fair values.
In order to calculate a more accurate valuation figure, given the multitude of reliable scenarios generated when altering the discounted cash flows variables, a probability weighting expected return method is utilised.
Having applied probabilities to the various possible scenarios, the method returned an estimated asset value of 1.3m at 31 December 2014 2013: 3.1m.

Investments in 27 companies have been classified as Level 3 and the individual valuations for each of these have been arrived at using a variety of valuation techniques and assumptions.
Where fair values are based upon the most recent market transaction, but that transaction occurred more that twelve months prior to the balance sheet date, the investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair values of investments categorised as Level 3 are analysed on a monthly basis to determine business factors which may make the most recent investment rate no longer a representation of fair value.
There are no identified unobservable inputs to which the Level 3 fair values would be materially sensitive.
This is represented by the fact that if the fair value of all Level 3 investments were to decrease by 10%, the net assets figure would decrease by 1.5m, with a corresponding increase if the unobservable inputs were to increase by 10%.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
Transfers between tiers are then made as if the transfer took place on the first day of the period in question except in the cases of transfers between tiers based on an initial public offering IPO of an investment wherein the changes in value prior to the IPO are calculated and reported in tier 2, and those changes post are attributed to tier 1.
If the assumptions used in the valuation techniques for the Groups holding in each company are varied by using a range of possible alternatives, there is no material difference to the carrying value of the respective spin-out company.
The effect on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period is also not expected to be material.
IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 106 23830.04 Proof 7 1-04-2015 Our Financials Group Notes Our Financials Group Notes Transfers between Level 2 and 1 occur when a previously unquoted investment undertakes an initial public offering, resulting in its equity becoming quoted on an active market.
In the current period, transfers of this nature amounted to 20.4m.
Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 would occur when a quoted investments market becomes inactive.
There have been no such instances in the current period.
Transfers between Level 3 and Level 2 occur when an investment which previously had a most recent investment of over twelve months ago undertake an investment, resulting in an observable market rate.
In the current period, transfer of this nature amounted to 20.5m.
Transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 occur when an investments recent investment becomes more than twelve months old, with the price becoming deemed unobservable.
In the current period, transfers of this nature amounted to 12.4m.

Contingent Value Rights As a result of the disposal of Proximagen Group plc in August 2012, the Group received contingent consideration, in the form of contingent value rights CVRs, based upon future net revenues of two associated drug programmes.
In line with the Groups policies, these have been recognised as financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, and have been fair valued at 1.4m 2013: 1.4m.
The Group considers this asset to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy throughout the current and previous financial years.
If the assumptions used in the valuation techniques are varied by using a range of possible alternatives, there is no material difference to the statement of financial position nor the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

In March 2014, the Group issued 39,150,484 shares to the shareholders of Fusion IP plc in exchange for the remaining 79.9% equity stake in the company.
In March 2014, the Group issued 4,508,994 new ordinary shares with a par value of 2p in order to settle the 2011 LTIP scheme which partially achieved its vesting conditions and consequently became payable to the Groups employees.
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry equal voting rights, equal rights to income and distributions of assets on liquidation, or otherwise, and no right to fixed income.
Operating Lease Arrangements 2014 2013 m m Payments under operating leases recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the year 0.4 0.4 At the reporting date, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2014 2013 m m Within one year 0.3 0.3 In the second to fifth years inclusive 0.3 0.6 0.6 0.9 Operating lease payments represent rentals and other charges payable by the Group for its office properties.
Leases are negotiated for an average term of five years and rentals are fixed for an average of one year.
Share-Based Payments Annual Incentive Scheme AIS In 2014, the Group continued to incentivise employees through its Long-Term Incentive Plan and Annual Incentive Schemes.
The AIS awards include an element of IP Group shares, which are subject to further time-based vesting over two years typically 50% after year one and 50% after year two.
As at 31 December 2014, the 2013 AIS options or shares had been granted and are expected to vest in 2015 and 2016.
However, as the number shares to be granted are based as a percentage of employees salary, the share-based payments line includes the associated expense incurred in 2014.
No associated expense has been incurred for the 2014 AIS as the financial performance targets were not achieved.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards Awards under the LTIP take the form of conditional awards of ordinary shares of 2p each in the Group which vest over the prescribed performance period to the extent that performance conditions have been met.
The Remuneration Committee imposes objective conditions on the vesting of awards and these take into consideration the guidance of the Groups institutional investors from time to time.
Further information on the Groups LTIP is set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 74.
IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 108 23830.04 Proof 7 1-04-2015 Our Financials Group Notes Our Financials Group Notes For reasons detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report, the 2013 and 2014 LTIP awards were both made in 2014.
The awards will respectively ordinarily vest on 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2017, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
The awards are based on the performance of the Groups Hard NAV and Total Shareholder Return TSR.
Both performance measures are combined into a matrix format to most appropriately measure performance relative to the business, as shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 67.
The total award is subject to an underpin based on the relative performance of the Groups TSR to that of the FTSE250 index, which can reduce the awards by up to 50%.
The 2014 LTIP matrix is designed such that up to 100% of the award prior to the application of the underpin will vest in full in the event of both Hard NAV increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis, from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 2013 LTIP: 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015, and TSR increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis from the date of award to 31 March 2017 2013 LTIP: to 31 March 2016, using an industry-standard average price period at the beginning and end of the performance period.
Further, the matrix is designed such that 30% of the award shall vest again prior to the application of the underpin if the cumulative increase is 8% per annum for both measures over their respective performance periods threshold performance.
A straight-line sliding scale is applied for performance between the distinct points on the matrix of vesting targets.
No LTIP awards were made in 2013.
The 2012 LTIP awards will ordinarily vest on 31 March 2015 to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
The awards are based on the performance of Groups Hard NAV and TSR.
Both performance measures are combined into a matrix format to most appropriately measure performance relative to the business, as shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 66.
The total award is subject to an underpin based on the relative performance of the Groups TSR to that of the FTSE Small Cap index, which can reduce the awards by up to 50%.
The matrix is designed such that up to 100% of the award prior to the application of the underpin will vest in full in the event of both Hard NAV increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis, from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014, and TSR increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis from the date of award to 31 March 2015, using an industry-standard average price period at the beginning and end of the performance period.
The 2011 LTIP awards vested on 31 March 2014 and thereafter shares in IP Group were issued via the Groups employee benefit trust to the relevant members of the Groups staff accordingly.
The table below sets out the performance measures relating to the 2011 LTIP awards and the actual performance achieved.

Lansdowne Partners Limited and Invesco Perpetual received 8,094,900 and 6,243,656 new consideration shares respectively as a result of the completion of the Acquisition.
Capital Management The Groups key objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of issue new shares or dispose of interests in more mature portfolio companies.
During 2014, the Groups strategy, which was unchanged from 2013, was to maintain healthy cash and short-term deposit balances that enable it to provide capital to all portfolio companies, as determined by the Groups investment committee, whilst having sufficient cash reserves to meet all working capital requirements in the foreseeable future.
Capital Commitments Commitments to university partnerships A number of the Groups partnerships with research intensive universities in the UK include certain arrangements to provide seed capital to spin-out companies arising from such universities.
As at 31 December 2014, the balances were as follows: Year of Original Invested Remaining commencement commitment to date commitment Partnership of partnership m m m i University of Southampton 2002 5.0 3.6 1.4 ii Kings College London 2003 5.0 1.8 3.2 iii University of York CNAP 2003 0.8 0.2 0.6 iv University of Leeds 2005 4.2 0.7 3.5 v University of Bristol 2005 5.0 1.1 3.9 vi University of Surrey 2006 5.0 0.5 4.5 iii University of York 2006 5.0 0.1 4.9 vii Queen Mary University of London 2006 5.0 0.7 4.3 viii University of Bath 2006 5.0 0.2 4.8 ix University of Glasgow 2006 5.0 1.2 3.8 x University of Manchester 2013 7.5 0.1 7.4 52.5 10.2 42.3 i Under the terms of an agreement entered into in 2002 between the Group, the University of Southampton and certain of the University of Southamptons subsidiaries, IP2IPO Limited agreed to make 5.0m available for the purposes of making investments in University of Southampton spin-out companies.
ii Under the terms of an agreement entered into during 2003 between the Group and Kings College London KCL and Kings College London Business Limited formerly KCL Enterprises Limited, the Group agreed to make 5.0m available for the purposes of making investments in spin-out companies.
Under the terms of this agreement, KCL was previously able to require the Company to make a further 5.0m available for investments in spin-out companies on the tenth anniversary of the partnership.
However, the 2003 agreement was terminated and replaced by a revised agreement between the same parties on 12 November 2010.
Under the revised agreement, the Group has agreed to target investing the remaining commitment of 3.2m over a three-year period: KCL cannot, however, require the Group to make any additional funds available.
Other changes effected by the revised agreement included the removal of the Groups automatic entitlement to initial partner equity in every spin-out company and or a share of KCLs licensing fees from intellectual property commercialisation and to the termination rights of the parties.
iii In 2003, the Group entered into an agreement with the University of York.
The agreement relates to a specialist research centre within the University of York, the Centre for Novel Agricultural Products CNAP.
The Group has committed to invest up to a total of 0.8m in spin-out companies based on CNAPs intellectual property.
In 2006, the Group extended its partnership with the University of York to cover the entire university.
The Group has committed to invest 5.0m in University of York spin-outs over and beyond the 0.8m commitment as part of the Groups agreement with CNAP.
The agreement with the University of York was amended during 2013 so as to alter the process by which the Group evaluates commercialisation opportunities and the level of initial partner equity the Group is entitled to as a result.
Further, the Groups automatic entitlement to share in any of the University of Yorks proceeds from out-licensing has been removed from the agreement.
iv The Group extended its partnership with the University of Leeds in July 2005 by securing the right with associated contractual commitment to invest up to 5.0m in University of Leeds spin-out companies.
This agreement was varied in March 2011 to, amongst other things, remove the Groups entitlement to a share of out-licensing income generated by the University of Leeds except in certain specific circumstances where the Group is involved in the relevant out-licensing opportunity.
Under the terms of the variation agreement, subject to quality and quantity of the investment opportunities, the Group, Techtran Group Limited and the University of Leeds have agreed to target annual investments of at least 0.7m in aggregate and, subject to earlier termination or the parties otherwise agreeing alternative target, to review this target on 30 April 2017.

viii In September 2006, the Group entered into an agreement with the University of Bath to invest in University of Bath spin-out companies.
The Group has committed to invest up to a total of 5.0m in University of Bath spin-out companies.
The agreement with the University of Bath was amended during 2009 so as to remove the Groups automatic entitlement to a share of the initial equity or licence fees as applicable received by the University of Bath from the commercialisation of its intellectual property in the event that the Group and its employees have not been actively involved in developing the relevant opportunity.

Acquisition of subsidiaries Acquisition of Fusion IP plc In 2009, the Group subscribed for a 20.1% stake in Fusion IP plc Fusion IP, a similar intellectual property commercialisation firm, and entered into an agreement with Fusion IP under which it acquired co-investment rights in all future Fusion IP portfolio companies.
On 20 March 2014, the Group acquired the remaining 79.9% equity stake in Fusion IP, in exchange for 39,150,484 shares in IP Group plc.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2014 include the results of Fusion IP for the nine-month period from the acquisition date.
Fair value of net assets liabilities m Net assets acquired: Acquired intangible assets 21.4 Investment portfolio 24.9 Trade and other receivables 1.1 Cash and cash equivalents 17.6 Trade and other payables less than one year 1.1 Trade and other payables more than one year 0.3 Net assets 63.6 i Less: fair value of 20.1% interest previously held 20.5 Share of net assets acquired 43.1 Goodwill 38.7 Total consideration 81.8 Consideration satisfied by: ii Issue of share capital 39,150,484 shares at 209 pence 81.8 i In the period from 1 January 2014 to the date of acquisition, the fair value of the Groups existing stake in Fusion IP increased in value by 6.0m and is recognised in the change in fair value of equity and debt investments in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
ii Being the closing price of IP Group plc shares on 20 March 2014, the date of acquisition.
From the date of acquisition, Fusion IP has contributed 2.6m of gains through the acquired portfolio companies to the fair value gains, 0.2m to revenue from services and other income, and 2.7m in expenses for the year.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2014, the acquisition would have contributed 3.0m to fair value gains, 0.4m to revenue from services and other income, and 3.4m expense for the period.
com 115 23830.04 Proof 7 1-04-2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 26.
Acquisition of subsidiaries continued The Group incurred acquisition costs of 1.1m relating to, amongst other items, brokers fees, legal costs and due diligence costs.
These costs are reflected separately on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The balances noted above for trade and other receivables, as well as trade and other payables less than one year, represent the fair value of the receivables at the date of acquisition and are not materially different from the carrying values held by Fusion IP prior to acquisition.
The fair value of the acquired trade and other receivables is equivalent to the gross contractual amounts receivable, being the best estimate at the acquisition date of the contractual cash flows expected to be collected.
Prior to acquisition, Fusion IP recognised an additional 1.5m in trade and other payables due over more than one year relating to balances owed to university partners on the basis of the values of associated spin-out companies.
On applying the Groups valuation policies as described in note 1 to these spin-outs, a number were impaired and, correspondingly, the fair value of the associated liability has been adjusted to reflect these fair value changes.
The remaining balances owed to Fusion IPs university partners are contingent upon both timing and value of the realisation of the associated spin-outs.
At the date of its acquisition by the Group, Fusion IP had contractual arrangements and memorandums of understanding with four UK universities.
At the date of acquisition of Fusion IP, the acquired intangible assets were valued at 21.4m.
The fair value of the acquired intangible assets was calculated on an indexed cost basis as there is a limited number of such arrangements with universities and there is no active market.
As the contractual agreements are for a finite term, the intangible assets will be subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortisation will occur over the remaining term, or useful life, of each contractual arrangement.
Both the acquired intangible assets and the associated cost of amortisation are shown in individual lines on the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income respectively.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Fusion IP primarily relates to the expertise, knowledge and processes concerning successful commercialisation of intellectual properties through early investment and development gained by the Group.
The goodwill forms part of the university partnership CGU.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Further detail on goodwill can be found in note 11.
Post Balance Sheet Events On 10 March 2015, the Group announced a proposed firm placing, placing and open offer to raise gross proceeds of 128m.
