28 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Risk management policies and procedures The Company invests in equities and other financial instruments for the long-term to further the investment objective set out on page 37.
This exposes the Company to a range of financial risks that could impact on the assets or performance of the Company.
The main risks arising from the Companys pursuit of its investment objective are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and gearing risk and the Directors approach to the management of them is set out below.
The risks have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which the financial statements relate.
The Companys exposure to financial instruments comprise: Equity and non-equity shares which are held in the investment portfolio in accordance with the Companys investment objective.
Term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Companys operations Cash, liquid resources and short-term receivables and payables that arise directly from the Companys operations Derivative transactions which the Company enters into may include equity or index options, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these is to manage the market price risks, foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks arising from the Companys investment activities.
The overall management of the risks is determined by the Board and its approach to each risk identified is set out below.
The Board and the investment manager co-ordinate risk management and the investment manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision.
a Market Risk Market risk comprises three types of risk: market price risk see note 28 a i, currency risk see note 28 a ii, and interest rate risk see note 28 a iii.
i Market Price Risk The Company is an investment company and as such its performance is dependent on the valuation of its investments.
Consequently market price risk is the most significant risk that the Company faces.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about the future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
A detailed breakdown of the investment portfolio is given on 104 to 108.
Investments are valued in accordance with the Companys accounting policies as stated in Note 2 f. At the year end, the Companys portfolio included no derivative instruments 30 April 2013: two, both of which were interest rate swaps.
Management of the risk In order to manage this risk it is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce both the statistical risk and the risk arising from factors specific to a particular technology sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets, together with stock selection covering small, medium and large companies, and the use of index options, are other factors which act to reduce price risk.
The investment manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.

Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the value of shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% 30 April 2013: 15% in the fair values of the Companys investments.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions and historic trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys investments at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk The investment manager mitigates the individual currency risks through the international spread of investments and may make use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are entered into to manage the asset exposure to those currencies, which vary according to the asset allocation.

Based on the year end position, if Sterling had depreciated, by a further 10% against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 30 April 2014 000 Hong US Kong Korean Taiwan Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 369 30 11 2 16 62 Capital return 50,460 2,662 2,600 1,074 2,510 3,222 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 50,829 2,692 2,611 1,076 2,526 3,284 Change to shareholders funds 50,829 2,692 2,611 1,076 2,526 3,284 30 April 2013 000 Hong US Kong Korean Taiwan Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 279 50 11 1 9 52 Capital return 43,670 2,404 2,042 1,697 2,578 3,020 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 43,949 2,454 2,053 1,698 2,587 3,072 Change to shareholders funds 43,949 2,454 2,053 1,698 2,587 3,072 Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 98 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2014 Based on the year end position, if Sterling had appreciated, by a further 10% against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 30 April 2014 000 Hong US Kong Korean Taiwan Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 302 25 11 2 13 52 Capital return 41,286 2,178 2,127 878 2,054 2,636 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 41,588 2,203 2,138 880 2,067 2,688 Change to shareholders funds 41,588 2,203 2,138 880 2,067 2,688 30 April 2013 000 Hong US Kong Korean Taiwan Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 228 41 9 1 7 42 Capital return 35,730 1,967 1,670 1,389 2,109 2,471 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 35,958 2,008 1,679 1,390 2,116 2,513 Change to shareholders funds 35,958 2,008 1,679 1,390 2,116 2,513 In the opinion of the Directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses are representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
iii Interest Rate Risk Interest rate changes may affect the income received from cash at bank and interest payable on borrowings.
All cash balances earn interest at a variable rate.
The Company finances its operations through its term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained gains arising from operations.
The Company uses borrowings in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest to both generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Management of the risk The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
The Company may also enter into interest rate swap agreements.

30 April 2014 30 April 2013 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and Cash equivalents 54,950 54,950 33,271 33,271 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Interest rate swap 16 16 Bank loan 22,773 22,773 19,725 19,725 Total exposure to interest rates 32,177 32,177 13,530 13,530 Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The table below illustrates the Companys sensitivity to interest rate movements, with a change of 0.25% p. a. in the rates of interest available to the Companys financial assets and a change of 0.25% p. a in the rates of interest available to the Companys financial liabilities.
The effect on the revenue and capital return after tax and the value of shareholders funds are as follows if rates increased: 30 April 2014 30 April 2013 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 80 34 Capital return Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 80 34 Change to shareholders funds 80 34 A corresponding decrease in the rate would have equal and opposite effect to that shown in the table above.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as the level of cash loans held during the year will be affected by the strategy being followed in response to the Investment Managers perception of market prospects and the investment opportunities available at any particular time Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 100 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2014 b Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the possibility of the failure of the Company to realise sufficient assets to meet its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which may be sold to meet funding requirements as necessary.
Liquidity risk exposure The maturity of the Companys existing borrowings are set out in note 17 to the financial statements.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
At 30 April the financial liabilities comprised of: 30 April 2014 30 April 2013 000 000 Due within 1 month: Bank overdraft 148 Balances due to brokers 15,793 5,262 Accruals 1,850 297 Due after 3 months and within 1 year: Bank loan 22,938 19,922 Interest rate swap 46 Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2014101 5 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 30 April 2014 28 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued c Credit Risk Credit risk is the exposure to loss from the failure of a counterparty to deliver securities or cash for acquisitions or disposals of investments or to repay deposits.
Management of the risk The Company manages credit risk by using brokers from a database of approved brokers and by dealing through Polar Capital.
All cash balances are held with approved counterparties.
HSBC Bank plc is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The Companys assets are segregated from HSBCs own trading assets and are therefore protected in the event that HSBC were to cease trading.
These arrangements were in place throughout the current year and the prior year.
Credit risk exposure The maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 April 2014 was 62,154,000 30 April 2013: 43,120,000 comprising: 30 April 2014 30 April 2013 000 000 Balances due from brokers 6,851 9,560 Accrued income 353 281 Cash at bank 54,950 33,279 62,154 43,120 All of the above financial assets are current, their fair values are considered to be the same as the values shown and the likelihood of a material credit default is considered low.
None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
All deposits were placed with banks that had a rating of A or higher.
d Gearing risk The Companys policy is to increase its exposure to equity markets through the judicious use of borrowings.
When borrowings are invested in such markets, the effect is to magnify the impact on Shareholders funds of changes, both positive and negative, in the value of the portfolio.
Management of the risk The Company uses short-term loans to manage gearing risk, details of which can be found in note 17.
Gearing risk exposure The loans are valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method in the financial statements.
The Board regulates the overall level of gearing by raising or lowering cash balances.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc 102 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2014 e Capital Management Policies and Procedures The Companys capital, or equity, is represented by its net assets which are managed to achieve the Companys investment objective set out on page 37.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: i the planned level of gearing through the Companys fixed rate loan facility and ii the need to issue or buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the Companies Act with respect to its status as a public company.
In addition in order to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividend, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
The Company is also subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the loan covenants set out in the loan facility.
These requirements are unchanged since the previous year end and the Company has complied with them.
