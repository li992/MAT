They are however highly liquid assets.
2 Prepayments and accrued income and employee benefit assets are excluded from the trade and other receivables balance as the analysis above is required only for financial instruments.
3 The categories in this disclosure are determined by IAS 39.
Borrowings largely relate to Commercial Paper.
As at 31 December 2014 the Group had Commercial Paper in issue amounting to US$3,000m nominal values at rates of between 0.19% and 0.38% with maturities ranging from 6 January 2015 to 8 September 2015.
Finance leases are outside the scope of IAS 39, but they remain within the scope of IFRS 7.
Therefore finance leases have been shown separately.
4 The fair value of bonds at 31 December 2014 is a liability of 660m 2013: 597m.
This value is derived using a quoted market rate in an active market level 1 classification.
5 Social security liabilities and other employee benefit liabilities are excluded as the analysis above is required only for financial instruments.
6 Included in other non-current liabilities is 28m 2013: 21m to purchase the remaining shares of Shanghai Manon Trading Company Limited.
All financial instruments, with the exception of the bond, are in level 2 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
Fair value for financial instruments held at amortised cost has been estimated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 96 Financial Statements 14 Financial instruments and Financial risk management continued The fair value measurement hierarchy levels have been defined as follows: 1.
Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices level 2.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs level 3.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2014 is a liability of 29m 2013: 159m and an asset of 130m 2013: 22m.
This value is determined using forward exchange rates derived from market sourced data at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to present value level 2 classification.
As the value of level 3 instruments at 31 December 2014 is not material 2013: not material, no further level 3 disclosures have been made.
There have been no movements of financial instruments between levels 2013: nil.
offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities The Group has forward foreign exchange contracts and cash that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements.

The Group has in place a risk management programme that uses foreign currency financial instruments, including debt, and other instruments, to limit the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group.
The Groups financing and financial risk management activities are centralised into Group Treasury GT to achieve benefits of scale and control.
GT manages financial exposures of the Group centrally in a manner consistent with underlying business risks.
GT manages only those risks and flows generated by the underlying commercial operations and speculative transactions are not undertaken.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies, guidelines and authority levels for all areas of Treasury activity and individually approves significant activities.
GT operates under the close control of the CFO and is subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
Market Risk a Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The Groups policy is to align interest costs and operating profit of its major currencies in order to provide some protection against the translation exposure on foreign currency profits after tax.
The Group may undertake borrowings and other hedging methods in the currencies of the countries where most of its assets are located.
It is the Groups policy to monitor and only where appropriate hedge its foreign currency transaction exposure.
These transaction exposures arise mainly from foreign currency receipts and payments for goods and services and from the remittances of foreign currency dividends and loans.
The local business units enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with GT to manage these exposures where practical and allowed by local regulations.
GT matches the Group exposures, and hedges the net position where possible, using spot and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2014 was 4,337m payable 2013: 5,287m payable.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group designated bonds totalling $1,000m 642m and commercial paper of up to $2,537m 1,629m as the hedging instrument in a net investment hedge relationship.
The hedged risk is the foreign exchange currency risk on the value of the Groups net investment in assets and liabilities denominated in US dollars.
The net gain or loss under this arrangement is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The net effect on other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2014 was a 137m loss 2013: 6m gain.
The Group held forward foreign exchange contracts denominated as cash flow hedges primarily in Euro, Australian dollars, Singapore dollars, Sterling and US dollars.
Notional value of the payable leg resulting from these financial instruments was as follows: 2014 2013 Cash Flow hedge Profile m m Euro 432 319 Polish Zloty 233 9 US dollars 154 32 Sterling 153 98 Singapore dollars 77 120 Australian dollars 73 177 Other 233 51 1,355 806 These forward foreign exchange contracts are expected to mature over the period January 2015 to February 2016 2013: January 2014 to January 2015.
There is no ineffective portion recognised in the income statement arising from cash flow hedges 2013: nil.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income on forward exchange contracts in 2014 of 11m loss 2013: 13m gain are recognised in the income statement in the year or years during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is generally within 12 months from the balance sheet date.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.
RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 98 Financial Statements 14 Financial instruments and Financial risk management continued In the case of cash flow hedges, these are denominated in a diverse range of currencies, where a fluctuation in one individual currency relationship, with all others held constant, does not have a significant effect on the income statement or Shareholders equity.
A fluctuation analysis has been performed for all currencies.
The largest potential fluctuation would be in respect of forward contracts between the Euro and the Polish Zloty.
If the Euro had strengthened weakened by 5% against the Polish Zloty, with all other variables held constant, the impact on Shareholders equity would have been 2m.
If the US dollar had strengthened weakened by 5% against the Euro, with all other variables held constant, the impact on Shareholders equity would have been 2m 2013: 12m Australian dollar against Singapore dollar.
As at 31 December 2014 if all other currencies had strengthened weakened by 5% against Sterling with all other variables held constant, this would have had an immaterial effect on the income statement or Shareholders equity 2013: immaterial.
The remaining major monetary financial instruments liquid assets, receivables, interest and non-interest bearing liabilities are directly denominated in the functional currency of the Group or are transferred to the functional currency of the local entity through the use of derivatives.
The gains and losses from fair value movements on derivatives held at fair value through the profit or loss, recognised in the income statement was a 116m gain 2013: 89m loss.
b Price risk Due to the nature of its business the Group is exposed to commodity price risk related to the production or packaging of finished goods, such as oil related, and a diverse range of other, raw materials.
This risk is, however, managed primarily through medium-term contracts with certain key suppliers and is not therefore viewed as being a material risk.
c Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Group has both interest-bearing and non interest-bearing assets and liabilities.
The Group monitors its interest income and expense rate exposure on a regular basis.
The Group manages its interest income rate exposure on its gross financial assets by using a combination of fixed rate term deposits.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift.
For each simulation, the same interest rate shift is used for all currencies, calculated on a full year and pre-tax basis.
The scenarios are only run for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
Based on the simulations performed, the impact on the income statement of a 50 basis-point shift in interest rates would be a maximum increase of 7m 2013: 11m or decrease of 7m 2013: 11m, respectively for the liabilities covered.
The simulation is done on a periodic basis to verify that the maximum loss simulated is within the limit given by management.
2. Credit Risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers.
The credit quality of trade and other receivables is detailed in note 13.
Financial institution counterparties are subject to approval under the Groups counterparty risk policy and such approval is limited to financial institutions with a BBB rating or above.
The Group uses BBB and higher rated counterparties to manage risk and only uses BBB rated counterparties by exception.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit defined within the counterparty risk policy, which is reassessed annually by the Board of Directors.
Derivative financial instruments are only traded with counterparties approved in accordance with the approved policy.
Derivative risk is measured using a risk weighting method.
The table below summarises the Groups major financial institution counterparties by credit rating lower of S&P and Moodys and balances cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits at the balance sheet date.

Liquidity Risk Cash flow forecasting is performed by the local business units and on an aggregated basis by GT.
GT monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
Funds over and above those required for short-term working capital purposes by the local businesses are generally remitted to GT.
The Group uses the remittances to settle obligations, repay borrowings, or, in the event of a surplus, invest in short-term instruments issued by institutions with a BBB rating or better.
The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The Group has bilateral credit facilities with high-quality international banks.
All of these facilities have similar or equivalent terms and conditions, and have a financial covenant, which is not expected to restrict the Groups future operations.
At the end of 2014, the Group had, in addition to its long-term debt of 636m 2013: 598m, committed borrowing facilities totalling 3,500m 2013: 4,350m, of which 3,500m exceeded 12 months maturity 2013: 3,500m.
Of the total facilities at the year end, nil 2013: nil was utilised.
The committed borrowing facilities, together with available uncommitted facilities and central cash and investments, are considered sufficient to meet the Groups projected cash requirements.
The undrawn committed facilities available, in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met at the balance sheet date, were as follows: 2014 2013 m m Undrawn committed borrowing facilities: Expiring within one year 850 Expiring between one and two years 500 Expiring after more than two years 3,500 3,000 3,500 4,350 All borrowing facilities are at floating rates of interest.
The facilities have been arranged to cover general corporate purposes including support for commercial paper issuance.
All facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
Headroom between net debt and available facilities at 31 December 2014 was 1,957m 2013: 2,254m.
The Groups borrowing limit at 31 December 2014 calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association was 63,186m 2013: 61,689m.

Capital Management The Group considers capital to be net debt plus total equity.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, short-term available for sale financial assets and financing derivative financial instruments refer to note 16.
Total equity includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the Group Balance Sheet.
2014 2013 m m Net debt note 16 1,543 2,096 Total equity 6,834 6,336 8,377 8,432 The objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for Shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to optimise the cost of capital.
In maintaining an appropriate capital structure and providing returns for Shareholders, the Company provided returns to Shareholders in 2014 in the form of dividends and the buy back of shares.
Refer to notes 28 and 22 respectively.
The Group monitors net debt and at year end the Group had net debt of 1,543m 2013: 2,096m.
The Group seeks to pay down net debt using cash generated by the business to maintain an appropriate level of financial flexibility.
