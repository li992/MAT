The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and nancing activities.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at cost and then subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Where a forward contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in future cash inows, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
Anyeffective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the profit and loss account at the same time as the hedged transaction.
Theineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
