These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 60: Group 2014 2013 Retiring at the end of the reporting year Male 88.7 88.6 Female 90.2 90.1 Retiring 20 years after the end of the reporting year Male 90.6 90.5 Female 92.2 92.1 The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the principal assumptions is: Impact on present value of scheme obligations m 0.1% increase in discount rates 5.1 0.1% increase in inflation rate 2.5 0.1% increase in salary increase rate 0.9 1 year increase in life expectancy 6.8 The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Plan assets are comprised as follows: 2014 2013 m % m % Equity instruments 75.6 37% 74.1 42% Diversified growth funds 59.7 29% 51.2 29% Gilts 11.8 6% Bonds 58.8 28% 49.6 28% Cash and cash equivalents 0.6 1.4 1% Total 206.5 100% 176.3 100% No plan assets are the Groups own financial instruments or property occupied or used by the Group.
Through the defined benefit plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: a Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The Plan holds a significant proportion of equities and diversified growth funds, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term.
b Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Plans bond holdings.
c Inflation risk Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the Plans assets are either unaffected by or are loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
