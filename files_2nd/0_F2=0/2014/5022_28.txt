NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 28 June 2014 1 Segmental reporting The Group has one reportable segment, retail of homewares in the UK.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Board of Directors of Dunelm Group plc.
Internal management reports are reviewed by them on a monthly basis.
Performance of the segment is assessed based on a number of financial and non-financial KPIs as well as on profit before taxation.
Management believe that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
All material operations of the reportable segment are carried out in the UK.
The Groups revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or Group of customers.

8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period excluding ordinary shares purchased by the company and held as treasury shares note 19.

These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary Shares during the period.

These amounts represent deferred income in respect of lease incentives received, and will be released to the income statement after more than one year.
16 Interest bearing loans and borrowings The Group has no committed borrowing facilities because of its strong cash position.
It has an uncommitted overdraft facility of 10m.
17 Financial risk management The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
A formal process for reviewing and managing risk in the business is in place.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as foreign exchange hedging agreements with its banking counterparties.
The Group only deals with creditworthy counterparties and uses publicly available financial information to rate its counterparties.
Group policy is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties approved by the Board, with a minimum of A credit rating.
Credit limits with approved counterparties are limited to 25m for any individual party.
The Group maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by payments In advance of goods to overseas suppliers.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and extreme circumstances.
The Group manages this risk by continuously monitoring cash flow forecasts.
The Groups available facilities can be found in note 16.
All of the Groups derivative financial liabilities are due to settle within 18 months of the balance sheet date.
98 Dunelm Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financials 17 Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Groups bank borrowings, if any, incur variable interest rate charges.
The Directors do not consider that future changes in interest rates are likely to cause a material direct impact on profitability.
The Groups exposure to interest rates on financial assets and liabilities is detailed in note 16.
Foreign currency risk All of the Groups revenues are in sterling.
Purchases of promotional goods are generally in US dollars.
Purchase of regular range goods are generally in sterling, although some lines are now being imported directly and paid for in US dollars.
The Group cover exchange rate exposure on expected promotional product purchases up to a maximum of 100% of forecast purchases over a four month horizon.
Exchange rate exposure is covered on expected regular range purchases up to a maximum of 50% of forecast purchases over a 12 month horizon.
The Group uses various means to cover the above currency exposures: hold excess funds in US dollars, take out forward contracts for the purchase of US dollars, enter into forward rate options.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on purchases denominated in US dollars.
These amounted to approximately 16% of the total stock purchases in the period ended 28 June 2014.
The outstanding US dollar liabilities at the period end were $150,000 2013: $525,000 During the period the Group entered into exchange rate swaps for $88.8m to sell sterling and buy US dollars.
These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
During the period the net mark to market loss on foreign currency hedging instruments taken to equity was 3.3m 2013: 0.4m profit.
At the balance sheet date the Group had 13 swap contracts outstanding with an aggregate maximum value of $87.2m.
In the event of a significant adverse movement in the US dollar exchange rate, the Group could seek to minimise the impact on profitability by changing the selling price of goods.
Sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposure is to the US dollar.
The Directors believe that an increase or decrease of 10% in the US dollar to sterling exchange rates would not have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The US dollar period end exchange rate applied in the above analysis is 1.7016 2013: 1.5239.
Strengthening and weakening of sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and nature of foreign exchange derivatives.
Fair values The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying value.
The fair value of foreign currency contracts are sums required by the counterparties to cancel the contracts at the end of the period.
Fair value hierarchy Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
Losses on cash flow hedges net of deferred tax impact during the period amounted to 2,898,000 2013: gain 387,000.
Capital management The Company considers that its capital is equity.
The Boards objective with respect to capital management is to ensure the Group continues as a going concern in order to optimise returns to shareholders.
The Boards policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development.
The Board regularly monitors the level of capital in the Group to ensure that this can be achieved.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market.
The shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups share option programmes.
The Board has authorised a share purchase programme designed to ensure that all options expected to vest under share option schemes can be fulfilled out of treasury shares.

These grants are exercisable in November 2016, dependent on the level of growth in Group EPS relative to RPI, as well as continuing employment.
The maximum life of options under the LTIP is 10 years from the date of grant.
