Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year in the preparation of these financial statements, are set out below: a Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom company law and generally accepted accounting standards UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts dated January 2009 the SORP.
The Companys financial statements are presented in sterling.
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except where otherwise indicated.
b Investments Held at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss Listed investments have been designated by the Board as held at fair value through profit or loss and accordingly are valued at fair value, deemed to be bid market prices.
Unquoted investments are designated by the Board as held at fair value through profit or loss, and are valued by the Directors using primary valuation techniques such as earnings multiples, option pricing models, discounted cash flow analysis, recent transactions and in accordance with IPEVC valuation guidelines.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the Income Statement as gains or losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Also included within this caption are transaction costs in relation to the purchase or sale of investments, including the difference between the purchase price of an investment and its bid price at the date of purchase.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Investment Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised on the ex-dividend date.
Where no ex-dividend date is quoted, dividends are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
UK dividends are shown net of tax credits and foreign dividends are grossed up at the appropriate rate of withholding tax.
Income from fixed interest securities is recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate.
Deposit interest is accounted for on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except as follows: i expenses which are incidental to the acquisition or disposal of an investment, categorised as fixed assets held at fair value through profit or loss are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement: and ii expenses are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management and management fees have been charged to the Income Statement in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income, from the Companys portfolio.
As a result 5% of the investment management and management fees are charged to the revenue column of the Income Statement and 95% are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any performance fee accrued or paid is charged in full to the capital column of the Income Statement.

Finance costs are charged to the Income Statement in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income, from the Companys portfolio.
As a result 5% of the finance costs are charged to the revenue column of the Income Statement and 95% are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Finance charges, if applicable, including interest payable and premiums on settlement or redemption, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
f Taxation The tax effect of different items of expenditure is allocated between capital and revenue using the marginal basis.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not been reversed by the Balance Sheet date other than those differences regarded as permanent.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
Any liability to deferred tax is provided for at the average rate of tax expected to apply.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted to reflect the time value of money.
g Foreign Currency Transactions recorded in overseas currencies during the year are translated into sterling at the appropriate daily exchange rates.
Assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at that date.
Any gains or losses on the translation of foreign currency balances, whether realised or unrealised, are taken to the capital or the revenue column of the Income Statement, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature.
h Functional and Presentational Currency The results and financial position of the Company are expressed in sterling, being the Companys functional and presentational currency.
In arriving at the functional currency the Directors have considered the following: i the primary economic environment of the Company: ii the currency in which the original capital was raised: iii the currency in which distributions are made: iv the currency in which performance is evaluated: and v the currency in which the capital would be returned to Shareholders on a break up basis.
The Directors are of the opinion that sterling best represents the Companys functional currency.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash in hand and in banks and short-term deposits which are held to maturity are carried at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash in hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand, which form an integral part of the Companys cash management, are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

The merits and rationale behind such strategies are to enhance the capital return of the portfolio, facilitate management of portfolio volatility and improve the risk-return profile of the Company relative to its benchmark.
All derivative instruments are valued at fair value in the Balance Sheet in accordance with FRS 26: Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The equity swaps are accounted for as Fixed Assets in the Balance Sheet and Options are accounted for as Current Assets and or Current Liabilities in the Balance Sheet.
Each investment in options is reviewed on a case-by-case basis and are all deemed to be capital in nature.
As such, all gains and losses on the above strategies have been debited or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
All of the put and call options bought and sold during the year have been capital in nature.
All gains and losses on over-the-counter OTC equity swaps, during the swap term, are accounted for as investment holding gains or losses on investments.
Where there has been a re-positioning of the swap, gains and losses are accounted for on a realised basis.
All such gains and losses have been debited or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
k Capital Reserves The following are transferred to this reserve: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: realised and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature: expenses, together with the related taxation effect, in accordance with the above policies: and increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end.

The main risks that the Company faces arising from its financial instruments are: i market risk including foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk ii liquidity risk iii credit risk These risks and the Directors approach to the management of them, are set out in the Report of Directors on pages 8 to 10 and have not changed from the previous accounting period.
The Investment Manager, in close co-operation with the Board of Directors, co-ordinates the Companys risk management.
i Market risk The Companys portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations which are monitored by the Investment Manager in pursuance of the investment objective.
Further information on the portfolio is set out on pages 11 to 13.
Management of the risks: Derivative instruments are used to mitigate market price risk, enhance the capital returns, facilitate management of portfolio volatility and to improve the risk-return profile of the portfolio.
Use of derivatives The following strategies have been used during the financial year.
Put and Call Options Buy calls: provides leveraged long exposure, facilitates exposure while minimising capital at risk.
Buy puts: provides leveraged protection, facilitates exposure while minimising capital at risk.
Sells calls: against an existing position, provides partial protection from a decline in stock price: facilitates commitment to an exit strategy and exit price that is consistent with fundamental analysis.
Sell puts: provides an effective entry price at which to add to an existing position, or provides an effective entry price at which to initiate a new position.
OTC Swaps and collateral requirements The Company uses OTC swap positions to gain access to single stock exposure in India and China because the Company is not locally registered to trade in either market.
All of the single stock swaps are fully funded with the exception of 250,000 shares held in China Resources.
This position is not fully funded.
As a consequence collateral cash to the value of 0.3 million was held against this position.
In addition, at the year end the Company held one basket swap, OrbiMed Emerging Market Basket, which represents exposure to a basket of healthcare single stocks in the emerging markets.
This position is not fully funded and as a result collateral cash to the value of approximately 4.5 million was held against this position.
Subsequent to the year-end, the basket swap has been sold and the associated collateral cash has been returned to the Company.
During the year under review, dividend income was received from the following swap positions:- Sun Pharmaceutical position now sold, Aurobindo, Lupin and OrbiMed Emerging Markets Basket.
Offsetting disclosure Swap basket trades and OTC derivatives are traded under an ISDA Master Agreements.
The Company currently has agreements in place with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.
These agreements create a right of set-off that becomes enforceable only following a specified event of default, or in other circumstances not expected to arise in the normal course of business.
As a result, as the right of set-off is not unconditional, for financial reporting purposes, the Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities.

As a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly affect the sterling value of those items.

The Investment Manager does not hedge against foreign currency movements, but takes account of the risk when making investment decisions.
Foreign currency borrowing facilities are available and are currently being utilised, to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates, which might otherwise adversely affect the value of portfolio investments.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that the income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.

S. dollar 2013: 10% increase and decrease, a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against the Japanese yen 2013: 10% increase and decrease, and a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against the Swiss franc 2013: 10% increase and decrease.
These percentages have been determined based on market volatility in exchange rates over the previous 12 months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys foreign currency financial instruments held at each Balance Sheet date.

Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and borrowing under the multicurrency loan facility.
The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances except when required for collateral against the Companys derivative positions, with short term borrowing being used when required.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The Company has a loan facility with Goldman Sachs which is repayable on demand.
At 31 March 2014 62.7 million net of cash collateral was drawn down under this facility see page 25 and note 11 on page 56 2013: 31.4 million.
The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below.
Floating rate The floating interest rate exposure of the financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk at 31 March 2014 in respect of cash was nil 2013: nil.
At 31 March 2014 there was an overdraft position at Goldman Sachs of 62,723,000 2013: 31,419,000.
Interest rate sensitivity If interest rates had been 1% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Companys profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2014 and the net assets would increase decrease by 627,000 2013: increase decrease by 314,000.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its floating rate cash balances.
61 Worldwide Healthcare Trust PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2014 231544 Finsbury WWH pp49-pp66 11 06 2014 12:08 Page 62 Notes to the Accounts Financial Statements No continued tes to the Accounts Fixed rate At 31 March 2014, the Company held 4.4% of the portfolio in convertible bonds and securitised debt 2013: 2.7% of the portfolio.
The exposure is shown in the table below: Weighted average Weighted period average for which interest Fixed Floating rate is fixed rate rate rate 31 March 2014 Years % 000 000 Assets Convertible bonds US Dollars 3.62 0.95 23,635 Second lien loans US Dollars 1.98 2.16 8,004 31,639 Liabilities Bank loan facility US Dollars 62,723 62,723 Weighted average Weighted period average for which interest Fixed Floating rate is fixed rate rate rate 31 March 2013 Years % 000 000 Convertible bonds US Dollars 3.28 2.58 15,015 15,015 Liabilities Bank loan facility US Dollars 31,419 31,419 c Other price risk Other price risk may affect the value of the Companys investments.
If market prices of all of the Companys financial instruments including the derivatives at the Balance Sheet date had been 25% higher or lower 2013: 25% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant, the revenue return would have decreased increased by 85,000 2013: 66,000, and the capital return would have increased decreased by 176,760,000 2013: 137,191,000 and the return on equity would have increased decreased by 176,675,000 2013: 137,125,000.
The calculations are based on the portfolio valuations as at the respective Balance Sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
ii Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable within one week.
The Company has a loan facility repayable on demand with Goldman Sachs.
Interest on the facility is charged at the Federal Funds effective rate plus 1 week LIBOR-OIS Spread plus 35 basis points.
See page 25 and also glossary beginning on page 68.
In order to ensure diversification within the portfolio, the Board gives guidance to the Investment Manager concerning exposure limits to individual companies.
Geographical and sectoral exposure are also reviewed regularly by the Directors.

The carrying amounts of financial assets best represent the maximum credit risk at the Balance Sheet date.
The Companys listed investments are held on its behalf by Goldman Sachs acting as the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of a custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by that custodian to be delayed, however, the Board monitors the Companys risk to its custodians by reviewing continuously their internal control reports and their credit ratings.
Certain of the Companys assets are held by Goldman Sachs as collateral against the loan provided by them to the Company.
Such assets held by Goldman Sachs are available for rehypothecation.
As at 31 March 2014, assets with a total market value of 93.1 million 31 March 2013: 50.1 million were held as collateral against the loan facility which equates to 138% of the overdrawn position at Goldman Sachs of 67.5 million see note 11 on page 56 for further details.
Management of the risk The risk is not significant, and is managed as follows: by only dealing with brokers which have been approved by OrbiMed Capital LLC and banks with high credit ratings: by setting limits to the maximum exposure to any one counterparty at any time: by investing in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process: and by monitoring the assets subject to rehypothecation.

Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern and to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate level of gearing.
The Boards policy is to limit gearing to the lower of 120 million or 20% of the Companys net assets.
The capital structure of the Company consists of the equity share capital, retained earnings and other reserves as disclosed on the Balance Sheet on page 47.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as total assets less current liabilities before deducting any prior charges, minus cash and cash equivalents divided by Shareholders funds, expressed as a percentage.
As at 31 March 2014, the Company had a gearing percentage of 12.0% 2013: 9.8%.
The Board with the assistance of the Investment Manager and the Manager monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This includes a review of: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Investment Managers view of the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in treasury, in light of any share price discount to net asset value per share in accordance with the Companys share buy-back policy: the need for new issues of equity shares, including issues from treasury: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
