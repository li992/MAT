Accounting policies that are specific to a component of the financial statements have been incorporated into the relevant note.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of The Sage Group plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the EU.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except where adopted IFRS require an alternative treatment.
The principal variations from the historical cost convention relate to derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries prepared at the end of the reporting period.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to benefit from its activities.
New or amended accounting standards The following amended standards have been adopted in the financial statements.
These have not had a material impact.
Accounting standard Requirement Impact on financial statements This introduces changes to the recognition, The Group operates two small defined benefit IAS 19 revised 2011, Employee Benefits measurement, presentation and disclosure of schemes the majority of the Groups employees post-employment benefits.

This introduces the requirement for entities to The disclosure in note 13.1 has been updated IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement classify fair value measurements into a fair value to include the fair value hierarchy.
hierarchy based on the nature of the inputs.
The following new or amended standards have been adopted in the financial statements but have had no impact on the financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements Amendment to IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment Amendments to IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Amendment to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendment to IAS 12, Income taxes on deferred tax Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Strategic report on pages 2 to 59.
Having made reasonable enquiries, the directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Foreign currencies The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlements of monetary items and on the retranslation of monetary items are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised outside profit or loss.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised outside profit or loss.
110 The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 ra e c re or overnance nanc a s a emen s Strategic report Governance Financial statements The assets and liabilities of the Groups subsidiaries outside of the UK are translated into sterling using period end exchange rates.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Where differences arise between these rates, they are recognised in other comprehensive income and the translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in other comprehensive income are recycled in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale, with the exception of exchange differences recorded in equity prior to the transition to IFRS on 1 October 2004, in accordance with IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions by management.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies.
We continually evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgements based on available information.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are described below.
Revenue recognition The key area of judgement in respect of recognising revenue is the timing of recognition, specifically in relation to recognition and deferral of revenue on licence, support and other contracts where management assumptions and estimates are necessary.
For instance, when products are bundled together for the purpose of sale, the associated revenue, net of any applicable discounts, is allocated between the constituent parts of the bundle on a relative fair value basis, which determines the pattern of revenue recognition.
The Group has a systematic basis for allocating relative fair values in these situations, based upon published list prices.
In the limited circumstances in which published list prices are not available, a prudent approach is taken, whereby any discounts are recognised immediately.
See note 3.1 for the revenue recognition policy.
Goodwill impairment The judgements in relation to goodwill impairment testing relate to the assumptions applied in calculating the value in use of the operating companies being tested for impairment and the ongoing appropriateness of the cash-generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
The key assumptions applied in the calculation relate to the future performance expectations of the business.
The carrying value of goodwill and the key assumptions used in performing the annual impairment assessment are disclosed in note 6.1.
Archer Capital litigation The claim for damages made by Archer Capital in relation to the potential purchase of MYOB continues to be strongly rejected by management.
Based on supporting expert legal advice, management do not consider there to be a present obligation and the possibility of an outflow of resources is remote.
As such, no provision or contingent liability has been recognised in these financial statements.
Tax provisions The Group recognises certain provisions and accruals in respect of tax which involve a degree of estimation and uncertainty where the tax treatment cannot be finally determined until a resolution has been reached by the relevant tax authority.
Management bases estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain.
Future accounting standards The directors also considered the impact on the Group of other new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments.
The following revised and new accounting standards are currently endorsed but not yet effective for the Group for the year ended 30 September 2014.
None are expected to be material to the financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 27, Separate Financial Statements Amendment to IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendment to IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation Amendment to IAS 36, Impairment of Assets Amendment to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRIC 21, Levies IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers is expected to be effective from 1 January 2017.
The directors would not usually look so far ahead at new accounting standards: however, it is expected that this new standard may have a significant impact on revenue recognition for the software industry The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 111 Results for the year 2 Segment information This note shows how Group revenue and Group operating profit are split across the three geographical regions in which we operate, being Europe, Americas and Africa, Australia, Middle East and Asia AAMEA.
For each geographical region, revenue and operating profit are compared to prior year in order to understand the movements in the year.
This comparison is provided for statutory, underlying and organic revenue and operating profit.
Statutory results are the IFRS statutory results.
Adjustments are made to statutory results to arrive at an underlying result which is in line with how the business is managed and measured on a day to day basis.
Adjustments are made for items that are individually important in order to understand the financial performance.
If included, these items could distort understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
See note 3.6 for details of these adjustments.
In addition, the prior year underlying values are translated at current exchange rates, so that exchange rate impacts do not distort comparisons.
The contributions of current and prior year acquisitions and disposals are removed, so that results can be compared to prior year on a like for like basis.
In addition, the following reconciliations are made in this note.
Revenue per region reconciled to the profit for the year as per the income statement.
Statutory operating profit reconciled to underlying operating profit per region detailing the adjustments made.
Accounting policy In accordance with IFRS 8, Operating Segments, information for the Groups operating segments has been derived using the information used by the chief operating decision maker.
The Groups Executive Committee has been identified as the chief operating decision maker in accordance with their designated responsibility for the allocation of resources to operating segments and assessing their performance.
The Executive Committee use organic and underlying data to monitor business performance.
Operating segments are reported in a manner which is consistent with the operating segments produced for internal management reporting.
The Group is organised into three operating segments.
The UK is the home country of the parent.
The main operations are in the following territories: Europe France, UK & Ireland, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Portugal and Sagepay Americas US, Brazil and Canada AAMEA Africa, Australia, Middle East and Asia The Africa operations are principally based in South Africa: the Middle East and Asia operations are principally based in Singapore, Malaysia and UAE.
Segment reporting The tables below show a segmental analysis of the results for continuing operations.
The revenue analysis in the table below is based on the location of the customer which is not materially different from the location where the order is received and where the assets are located.

It also analyses the Groups profit before tax, by looking in more detail at the key operating costs, including a breakdown of the costs incurred as an employer, research and development costs, the cost of the external audit of the Groups financial statements and finance costs.
In addition, this note analyses the future amounts payable under operating lease agreements, which the Group has entered into as at the year-end.
These commitments are not included as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
This note also provides a breakdown of any material and non-recurring costs that have been reported separately on the face of the income statement.
3.1 Revenue Accounting policy Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
The Group reports revenue under two revenue categories, being: 1.
Recurring revenue: including subscription contracts including pay as you go contracts, maintenance and support, combined software support service contracts and payment processing services.
Subscription contract revenue and maintenance and support revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract including non-specified upgrades when included.
Revenue relating to future periods is classified as deferred income on the balance sheet.
Payment processing services revenue is recognised when the outcome of such transactions can be estimated reliably: the associated revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period.
Software and software-related services: including perpetual software licences, upgrades and other software-related services such as business forms, professional services and training.
Perpetual software licences and specified upgrades revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership relating to the licence have been transferred and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
This is deemed to be when the goods have left the warehouse to be shipped to the customer or when electronic delivery has taken place.
Other product revenue which includes business forms and hardware is recognised as the products are shipped to the customer.
Where software is sold with after-sales service, the consideration is allocated between the different elements on a relative fair value basis.
When products are bundled together before being sold to the customer, it is necessary to apply the recognition criteria to the separately identifiable components of a single transaction in order to reflect the substance of the transaction.
If discounts on bundles are offered, the discount is applied to the constituent parts of the bundle, based upon fair value.
Other services which include the sale of professional services and training revenue associated with the transaction is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period.

To arrive at underlying results, certain adjustments are made for items that are individually important and which could, if included, distort the understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
Management apply judgement in determining which items should be excluded from underlying performance.
Recurring items These are items which occur each year but which management judge to have a distorting effect on the underlying results of the Group.
These items relate specifically to merger & acquisition M&A activity which by its nature is irregular in its impact.
Items falling within this category include amortisation, fair value adjustments and acquisition related costs.
These do not include operating or integration costs related to the acquisition.
Recurring items are adjusted each year irrespective of materiality to ensure consistent treatment.
Non-recurring items These are items which management judge to be of a one-off nature or non-operational, which would distort a reader of the Companys accounts understanding of underlying business performance.

These assets are predominantly brands, customer relationships and technology rights.
Further details including specific accounting policies in relation to these assets can be found in note 6.2.
The fair value adjustment relates to the accounting loss on the settlement of the put and call arrangement to acquire 25% of the share capital of the Brazilian sub-group from the non-controlling interest holder.
This transaction occurred in August 2014.
Further details can be found in note 13.4.
The adjustment relating to acquisition-related items is made up of the cost of carrying out business combinations in the year 2.4m, 2013: 0.1m, partly offset by the net release of earn-out liabilities on previous acquisitions 1.6m.
Further details can be found in note 15.3.
The imputed interest adjustment on the put and call arrangement relates to the accounting adjustment made during the year to discount this liability to its present value.
This entry was made up until the liability was settled in August 2014.
As above, further details can be found in note 13.4.
Non-recurring items As a result of the annual goodwill impairment review, an impairment of the goodwill held in the Brazilian business has been identified in the year.
This impairment is driven by economic conditions in Brazil and a re-measurement of the future performance of Brazil performed by management.
Further details can be found in note 6.1.
The adjustment relating to litigation costs relates to the defence of the Archer Capital case, which is strongly rejected by management.
We have engaged in a vigorous defence of the case resulting in these non-recurring litigation costs.
Based upon legal advice, no provision or contingent liability has been recognised in these financial statements.
All other litigation costs which may be incurred through the normal course of business are charged through operational expenses.
The loss on disposals in the prior year was incurred as a result of the disposal of non-core products.
There are no such costs in the current year.
See note 4 for the tax impact of these adjustments.

Current tax expense represents the amount payable on this years taxable profits and any adjustments relating to prior years.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences between accounting and tax bases.
This note outlines the tax accounting policies, the current and deferred tax charges in the year and presents a reconciliation of profit before tax in the income statement to the tax charge.
Accounting policy The taxation charge for the year represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The charge is recognised in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
Current tax payable or receivable is based on the taxable income for the period and any adjustment in respect of prior periods.
Current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases.

In addition, there is an obligation to account for local business taxes in the corporate tax charge.
These additional tax charges are offset by research and development tax credits which are a government incentive in a number of operating territories.
5 Earnings per share This note shows how earnings per share EPS is calculated.
EPS is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each ordinary share.
Basic EPS is calculated on profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS shows what the impact would be if all outstanding share options were exercised and treated as ordinary shares at the year-end.
This note also provides a reconciliation between the statutory profit figure, which ties to the primary statements on page 104, and the Groups internal measure of performance, underlying profit.
See note 3.6 for details of the adjustments made between statutory and underlying profit, and note 4 for the tax impact on these adjustments.
Accounting policy Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held as treasury shares, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares.
They are share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 123 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Operating assets and liabilities 6 Intangible assets This note provides details of the non-physical assets used by the Group to generate revenues and profits.
These assets include items such as goodwill, and other intangible assets such as brands, customer relationships, computer software, intellectual property and technology which have predominantly been acquired as part of business combinations.
These assets are initially measured at fair value, meaning the best estimate of the value for which these assets could be sold in an arms length transaction.
Goodwill represents the excess between the amount paid to acquire the businesses over the fair value of the net assets at the acquisition date.
This section also explains the accounting policies applied and the specific judgements and estimates made by the directors in arriving at the carrying value of these assets.
6.1 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups total identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill previously written-off directly to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1 October 1998 has not been reinstated and is not recycled to the income statement on the disposal of the business to which it relates.
Gains and losses on disposal of the entity include the carrying amount of the foreign exchange on the goodwill relating to the entity sold except for goodwill taken to reserves prior to the transition to IFRS on 1 October 2004.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
The recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill relates is tested annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and the allocation represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored.

The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value-in-use.
In determining value-in-use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value.
In all cases, the approved plans for the five years following the current financial year form the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
Beyond the five year plan these projections are extrapolated using an estimated long-term growth rate.
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are the average medium term revenue growth rate, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
The average medium-term revenue growth rate for the first five years is primarily based on past performance.
The average revenue growth rate applied to CGUs was in the range of 1% 2013: 2% to 15% 2013: 14% reflecting the specific rates for each territory.
The long-term operating margin assumed for a CGUs operations is primarily based on past performance.
The long-term operating margin applied to CGUs was in the range of 26% 2013: 20% to 62% 2013: 47%, reflecting the specific rates for each territory.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed to be equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the country in which the CGUs operations are undertaken and were in the range of 1.3% 2013: 1.8% to 5.1% 2013: 5.8% reflecting the specific rates for each territory.
Discount rate The Group uses a discount rate based on a local Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC for each CGU, applying local government yield bonds and tax rates to each CGU on a geographical basis.
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money at the end of the reporting period and the risks specific to the CGU.
The discount rates applied to CGUs were in the range of 6.03% 2013: 4.4% to 17.05% 2013: 13.65%, reflecting the specific rates for each territory.
Impairment charge The Group performed its annual test for impairment, in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value for all CGUs with the exception of Brazil Americas segment.
An impairment of 44.3m was recognised, driven by economic uncertainty in Brazil which is expected to continue in the future.
Management remain confident in the long-term contribution of Brazil to the Group.
Following the impairment, the recoverable amount of the Brazilian CGU is 76.8m.
The key assumptions used in the impairment calculation for Brazil were revenue growth of 11% per annum, long term operating margin of 26%, long term growth of 3.8%, and discount rate of 17.05% 2013: 13.65%.
The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 125 Operating assets and liabilities continued 6 Intangible assets continued Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis was performed for each of the other CGUs to determine the headroom on the impairment calculation.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU, other than Brazil, to exceed its recoverable amount.
6.2 Other intangibles Accounting policy Intangible assets arising on business combinations are initially held at fair value less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The main intangible assets recognised are brands, technology and customer relationships.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Brand names 3 to 20 years Technology In process R&D IPR&D 3 to 7 years Customer relationships 4 to 15 years Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses if applicable.
Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed seven years.
The carrying value of intangibles is reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Internally generated software development costs qualify for capitalisation if the Group can demonstrate all of the following: The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it: Its ability to use or sell the intangible asset: how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits: The existence of a market or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset: The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset: Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during development.
Management have determined that to date, internally generated software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, development costs have not been capitalised.
Costs which are incurred after the general release of internally generated software or costs which are incurred in order to enhance existing products are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and included within research and development expense in the financial statements see note 3.2.
7 Property, plant and equipment This note details the physical assets used by the Group to operate the business and generate revenues and profits.
Assets are shown at their initial purchase price less depreciation, which is an expense that is charged over the useful life of these assets to reflect annual wear and tear.
Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis down to an assets residual value over its useful economic life as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold buildings and improvements over period of lease Plant and equipment 2 to 7 years Motor vehicles 4 years Office equipment 5 to 7 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the assets useful life and the lease term.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Working capital is made up of inventories, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.
Inventories mainly consist of warehouse stock of Sage products, awaiting shipment to business partners or distributors.
Trade and other receivables are made up of amounts owed to us by customers and amounts that we pay to our suppliers in advance.
Trade receivables are shown net of an allowance for bad and doubtful debts.
Our trade and other payables are amounts we owe to our suppliers that have been invoiced to us or accrued by us.
They also include taxes and social security amounts due in relation to our role as an employer.
This note also gives some additional detail on the age and recoverability of our trade receivables, which allows readers to better understand any credit risk faced by the Group as a part of everyday trading.
8.1 Inventories Accounting policy Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making allowances for slow moving or obsolete items.
Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the first-in-first-out method.
2014 2013 m m Materials 0.7 0.5 Finished goods 1.3 1.7 2.0 2.2 The Group consumed 12.5m 2013: 14.2m of inventories, included in cost of sales, during the year.
There was no material write down of inventories during the current or prior year.
8.2 Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.

The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk since the risk is spread over a large number of unrelated counterparties.
The directors estimate that the carrying value of financial assets within trade and other receivables approximated their fair value.
The Group considers the credit quality of trade and other receivables by geographical location.
The Group considers that the carrying value of the trade and other receivables that is disclosed below gives a fair presentation of the credit quality of the assets.
This is considered to be the case as there is a low risk of default due to the high number of recurring customers and credit control policies: thus the carrying value is expected to be the final value received.

The directors believe that there is no further provision required in excess of the provision for impairment of receivables.
The creation and releases of the provision for impaired receivables have been included in selling and administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amounts charged to the provision are generally written-off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
At 30 September 2014, trade receivables of 29.8m 2013: 33.4m were either partially or fully impaired.
2014 2013 The ageing of these receivables was as follows: m m Not due 4.7 3.1 Less than six months past due 7.1 7.3 More than six months past due 18.0 23.0 29.8 33.4 Trade receivables which were past their due date but not impaired at 30 September 2014 were 33.7m 2013: 46.3m.
2014 2013 The ageing of these receivables was as follows: m m Less than six months past due 31.3 41.1 More than six months past due 2.4 5.2 33.7 46.3 The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the fair value of each class of receivables mentioned above.
The Group held no collateral as security.
The directors estimate that the carrying value of trade receivables approximated their fair value.
8.3 Trade and other payables Accounting policy Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2014 2013 Trade and other payables can be analysed as follows: m m Trade payables 41.5 46.4 Other tax and social security payable 52.9 63.8 Other payables 71.1 46.5 Accruals 131.8 130.9 297.3 287.6 The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 131 Operating assets and liabilities continued 9 Post-employment benefits This note explains the accounting policies governing the Groups pension schemes, analyses the deficit on the defined benefit pension scheme and shows how it has been calculated.
The majority of the Groups employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes: additionally the Group does operate two small defined benefit schemes in France and Switzerland.
For defined contribution schemes, the Group pays contributions into separate funds on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to employees.
The risks associated with this type of plan are assumed by the member.
Contributions paid by the Group in respect of the current period are included in the income statement.
The defined benefit scheme is a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules, salary and length of pensionable service.
The income statement charge for the defined benefit scheme is the current past service cost and the net interest cost which is the change in the net defined benefit liability that arises from the passage of time.
The Group underwrites both financial and demographic risks associated with this type of plan.
Accounting policy Obligations under defined contribution schemes are recognised as an operating cost in the income statement as incurred.
The Group also operates a small defined benefit pension scheme in Switzerland and other post-employment benefit schemes in France.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from the assets of the Group.
The costs of providing benefits under these schemes are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Under French legislation, the Group is required to make one-off payments to employees in France who reach retirement age while still in employment.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included in selling and administrative expenses in the income statement.
Past service costs should be recognised on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment and the date the Group recognises  costs.
Interest on the net defined benefit liability and the imputed interest on pension plan liabilities comprise the pension element of the net finance cost income in the income statement.
Changes in the post-employment benefit obligation due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which they arise.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation and unrecognised past service cost and future administration costs at the end of the reporting period, less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximate to the terms of the related pension liability.
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation of a defined benefit plan requires estimation of future events, for example salary and pension increases, inflation and mortality rates.
In the event that future experience does not bear out the estimates made in previous years, an adjustment will be made to the plans defined benefit obligation in future periods which could have a material effect on the Group.
The Group adopted IAS 19 revised, Employee benefits, in the year.
The impact of this is not material to the Group so restated results have not been prepared.

In this note we outline the accounting policies, movements in the year on the deferred tax account and the net deferred tax asset or liability at the year-end.
A deferred tax asset represents a tax reduction that is expected to arise in a future period.
A deferred tax liability represents taxes which will become payable in a future period as a result of a current or an earlier transaction.
Accounting policy Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right.
Deferred income tax has been calculated at 20% 2013: 21.0% in respect of UK companies being the corporation tax rate at which timing differences are expected to reverse and at the prevailing rates for the overseas subsidiaries.
The Finance Act 2013, which was substantively enacted on 17 July 2013, includes legislation reducing the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014 and a further reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015, both of which were substantively enacted during the year, and therefore have been reflected in the tax balances below.
The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 135 Operating assets and liabilities continued 10 Deferred income tax continued 2014 2013 The movement on the deferred tax account is as shown below: m m At 1 October 4.4 19.5 Income statement credit 7.4 13.7 Disposal acquisition of subsidiaries 0.3 4.8 Exchange movement 0.9 2.0 Other comprehensive income equity movement in deferred tax 0.4 1.4 Transfer from current income tax liabilities At 30 September 2.8 4.4 Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
These have been included within the Other category.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12, Income Taxes during the year are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

The use of the word contingent means that the future obligation to make a payment is in question or the amount which would have to be paid is uncertain, to the extent that it could not be reliably estimated.
Accounting policy A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured reliably.
The Group does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements.
In the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group under business combinations, contingent liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The Group had no contingent liabilities at 30 September 2014 2013: none.
At any given time, in the normal course of business, events may arise, including litigation, which may require the Group to consider the recognition criteria for contingent liabilities.
Having considered all current facts and circumstances, the Group considers the likelihood of a material outflow of resources to be remote and therefore no amounts are provided or disclosed in these financial statements.
The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 137 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Net debt and capital structure 12 Cash flow and net debt This note analyses our operational cash generation, shows the movement in our net debt in the year, and explains what is included within our cash balances and borrowings at the year-end.
Cash generated from operations is the starting point of our cash flow statement on page 109.
This section outlines the adjustments for any non-cash accounting items to reconcile our accounting profit for the year to the amount of physical cash we generated from our operations.
Net debt represents the amount of cash held less borrowings, overdrafts and finance lease payments due.
Borrowings are mostly made up of fixed-term external debt which the Group has taken out in order to finance acquisitions in the past.

A liability for the same amount is included in trade and other payables on the balance sheet and is classified within net debt above.
12.3 Cash and cash equivalents excluding bank overdrafts Accounting policy For the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated statement of cash flows and the Consolidated balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity period of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are an integral part of a subsidiarys cash management are included in cash and cash equivalents where they have a legal right of set-off and there is an intention to settle net, against positive cash balances, otherwise bank overdrafts are classified as borrowings.

12.4 Borrowings Accounting policy Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of borrowing on an effective interest basis.

The Group has US$300.0m 185.0m, 2013: 185.3m of US senior loan notes, which were issued into the US private placement market in 2010.
A further US$400.0m 246.8m, 2013: 247.0m of US senior loan notes were issued into the US private placement market during 2013.
There were 110.5m drawings 2013: 9.6m under the multi-currency revolving credit facility of 509.8m 2013: 346.2m expiring on 26 June 2019, which consists both of US$551.0m 339.9m, 2013: 167.3m and of 218.0m 169.9m, 2013: 178.9m tranches.
In the table above, bank loans and loan notes are stated net of unamortised issue costs of 3.5m 2013: 2.0m.
The Group has in the year incurred total issue costs amounting to 2.6m 2013: 1.3m in respect of the refinancing of its revolving credit facility renewal.
These issue costs were paid during the year ended 30 September 2014.
These costs are allocated to the income statement over the term of the facility using the effective interest method.
13 Financial instruments This note shows details of the fair value and carrying value of short and long term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, short-term bank deposits, cash at bank and in hand and other financial liabilities.
These items are all classified as financial instruments under accounting standards.
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction.
In order to assist users of these financial statements in making an assessment of any risks relating to financial instruments, this note also shows the ageing of these items and analyses their sensitivity to changes in key inputs, such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Accounting policy Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provision of the instrument.

The fair value of the long-term borrowings is determined by reference to interest rate movements on the US $ private placement market and therefore can be considered as a level 2 fair value as defined within IFRS 13.

All these facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
In addition, the Group maintains overdraft and uncommitted facilities to provide short-term flexibility and has also utilised the US private placement market.
13.4 Other financial liabilities Accounting policy The Group makes use of contingent contracts for the purchase of its own shares.
These derivative contracts are accounted for as equity transactions and the contracts are not stated at their market values.
The present value of the obligation to purchase the shares is recognised in full at the inception of the contract, even when that obligation is conditional.
Any subsequent reduction in the total obligation arising from the early termination of a contract is credited back to equity at the time of termination.
Where put and call agreements are in place in respect of shares held by a non-controlling interest, the put element is accounted for as a financial liability.
The amount that may become payable under the option on exercise is initially recognised at present value with a corresponding charge directly to equity.
At the end of each period, the valuation of the liability is reassessed with any changes recognised in the income statement.
2014 2013 m m Current liabilities : Close period share buyback programme 60.1 30.0 Non-current liabilities: Put and call arrangement to acquire non-controlling interest 54.2 Total other financial liabilities 60.1 84.2 The fair value of the close period share buyback programme has been calculated based on the value of the contractual legal agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Limited, which is also equal to the book value.
The put and call arrangement to acquire the remaining non-controlling interests 25% share in Folhamatic in Brazil was settled during 2014 for consideration of 50.4m, increasing the Groups ownership of the Brazilian sub-Group to 100%.
In the prior year, the liability was estimated at 55.4m, which was 54.2m after discounting to the present value of the estimated redemption amount.
The redemption amount was calculated based on a multiple of expected EBITDA for the year ending 31 December 2014.
Movements on charging the discount of 0.8m 2012: 1.2m have been recognised within finance costs.
2014 2013 m m Opening fair value at 1 October 54.2 68.3 Consideration paid 50.4 Imputed interest recognised in the Consolidated income statement within finance costs 0.8 1.2 Loss gain on fair value adjustments 0.4 13.5 Exchange movement 5.0 1.8 Closing fair value at 30 September 54.2 13.5 Sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings and deposits.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being sterling, US Dollar and Euro interest rates, and sterling US Dollar and sterling Euro exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis assumes reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in LIBOR to be 1%, based on interest rate history.
Similarly, sensitivity to movements in sterling US Dollar and sterling Euro exchange rates of 10% are shown, reflecting changes of reasonable proportion in the context of movement in those currency pairs over the last year.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the consolidated income statement and equity.

The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation is determined to be an effective hedge and is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
On disposal of the net investment, the foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instrument are recycled to the income statement from equity.
14 Equity This note analyses the movements recorded through shareholders equity that are not explained elsewhere in the financial statements, being changes in the amount which shareholders have invested in the Group.
The Group utilises share award schemes as part of its employee remuneration package.
Share option schemes for our employees include The Sage Group Performance Share Plan for directors and senior executives and The Sage Group Savings-related Share Option Plan the SAYE Plan for all qualifying employees.
We incur a cost in respect of these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.
This note also shows the dividends paid in the year and any dividends that are to be proposed and paid post year-end.
Dividends are paid as an amount per ordinary share held.
Accounting policy Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the Company until the shares are cancelled or reissued.

Performance Share Plan Under the Groups Performance Share Plan 5,519,987 2013: 6,265,091 awards were made during the year.
Restricted Share Plan The Groups Restricted Share Plan is a long-term incentive plan used in limited circumstances and usually on a one-off basis.
During the year 1,151,427 2013: nil awards were made.
Savings-related Share Option Scheme In addition, 1,532,520 2013: 757,980 options were granted under the terms of the Savings-related Share Option Scheme.
4 Under the above scheme, 508,852 1 77 p ordinary shares were issued during the year for aggregate proceeds of 1m.
14.2 Share-based payments Accounting policy Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest allowing for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes or the Monte Carlo pricing models.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

Executive Share Option Scheme There have been no grants of executive share options under the 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS since June 2008.
Long-term incentive awards are made under The Sage Group plc Performance Share Plan.
The performance targets governing the vesting of options are based on stretching EPS growth measured over a fixed three-year period from the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
30% of options will vest at the end of the period if the increase in EPS exceeds the Retail Prices Index RPI by 15% an average of 5% per year and 100% of those options will vest at that time only if the RPI is exceeded in that period by 27% an average of 9% per year.
Between those targets, options will vest on a straight-line basis.
If those targets are not met at the end of the three-year period, then no further retesting of the performance criteria will be undertaken and the options will lapse.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last four years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

The Sage Group Performance Share Plan Annual grants of performance shares will normally be made to executive directors and senior executives across the Group after the preliminary declaration of the annual results.
Awards prior to 2013 Annual awards under the Plan are limited to shares worth up to 300% of base salary.
In practice, annual grants to executive directors are limited to shares with a maximum value on award of 210% of base salary except in exceptional circumstances, such as a promotion or recruitment or to reflect local market practice.
The performance shares are subject to performance conditions on a sliding scale based on EPS.
25% of the award will vest at the end of the period if the increase in EPS exceeds RPI by 9% an average of 3% per year : 100% of the award will vest at that time only if RPI is exceeded in that period by 27% an average of 9% per year.
Between those targets, awards will vest on a straight-line basis, and if those targets are not met there is no opportunity for re-testing.
Awards are then subject to a total shareholder return TSR multiplier whereby the level of vesting based on EPS achievement will be adjusted according to TSR performance over the same three-year period compared with a group of international software and computer services companies.
The comparator group for awards made in 2012 comprised the following companies: Adobe Systems Cegid Logica Salesforce.
com ARM Holdings Dassault Systmes Micro Focus International SAP Blackbaud Exact Microsoft Software AG Cap Gemini Intuit Oracle If Sages TSR is ranked at lower quartile in the group, the multiplier is 0.75.
If Sages TSR is ranked at median in the group, the multiplier is 1.
If Sages TSR is ranked at upper quartile in the group, then the multiplier is 1.5.
Straight-line pro-rating applies between 0.75 and 1, and between 1 and 1.5, but the multiplier cannot be higher or lower than these figures.
Awards from 2013 onwards The performance shares are subject to both performance conditions and a TSR target.
Performance conditions are weighted one third on the achievement of an EPS target, and one third on the achievement of an organic revenue growth target.
The remaining one third is based on a TSR target.
The EPS vesting percentage is based on compound EPS growth.
Where compound EPS growth is between 6% and 12%, the EPS vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7%, and where compound EPS growth is between 12% and 15%, the EPS vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 145 Net debt and capital structure continued 14 Equity continued 14.2 Share-based payments continued The organic revenue growth target is based on the Companys compound annual organic revenue growth.
Where growth is between 4% and 8% the organic revenue growth vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7%, and where the Companys compound organic revenue growth is between 8% and 10%, the organic revenue growth vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
In order for the organic revenue growth target proportion to vest, the EBITA margin in the financial year ending 30 September 2016 must not be less than that of the EBITA margin for the financial year ending 30 September 2013.
The final third of the award is the performance target relating to TSR which measures share price performance against a designated comparator group.
Where the Companys TSR is between median and upper quartile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 6.7% and 26.7% and where the Companys TSR is between upper quartile and upper decile, the TSR vesting percentage will be calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis between 26.7% and 33.3%.
The TSR vesting percentage may only exceed 26.7% Stretch level if performance against either the EPS target or the organic revenue growth target is also at Stretch level.
The comparator group for awards in 2014 is the companies comprised in the FTSE 100 Index at the start of the performance period, excluding financial services and extraction companies.
Awards were valued using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model.
Performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed award life.

Each acquisition or disposal during the year is discussed in detail and the effects on the results of the Group are highlighted.
Accounting policy The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Revised, Business Combinations are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in the income statement.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups total identifiable net assets acquired.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the difference is recognised directly in the Consolidated income statement.
Any subsequent adjustment to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments is recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
Acquisition-related items such as legal or professional fees are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant shares acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Where the Group enters into put and call arrangements over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group continues to recognise the non-controlling interest until the ownership risks and rewards of those shares transfer to the Group.
