Explanatory Notes Continued Resolutions 14 and 15 Adoption of new share schemes Under the terms of the A. G. BARR p. l. c. Share Savings Scheme 2005 the 2005 SAYE, which was approved by the Company in general meeting on 24 May 2005, the Company can grant options to employees and executive directors who enter into a savings arrangement over a number of years, with the savings eventually used to fund the option exercise price.
No further options may be granted under the 2005 SAYE after 23 May 2015 and in addition there have been numerous recent and proposed legislative changes affecting Save As You Earn SAYE schemes.
For these reasons, the Board has recommended that a new SAYE the 2014 SAYE be adopted this year.
The 2014 SAYE would replace the 2005 SAYE for any future options granted.
The Board has also recommended that a new Long Term Incentive Plan the 2014 LTIP be adopted.
The 2014 LTIP would replace the existing A. G. BARR p. l. c. Long Term Incentive Plan 2003 the 2003 LTIP, which was approved by the Company in general meeting on 19 May 2003.
Resolutions 14 and 15, which, respectively, approve the adoption of the 2014 SAYE and the adoption of the 2014 LTIP, are proposed as ordinary resolutions.
The terms of the 2014 SAYE and the 2014 LTIP are summarised in pages 140 to 144 of this report.
Resolution 16 Authority to allot shares The directors may not allot shares in the Company unless authorised to do so by shareholders in general meeting.
Sub-paragraph a of Resolution 16, if passed, will authorise the directors to allot shares having an aggregate nominal value of up to 1,621,788.50, representing approximately one third of the Companys issued share capital as at 22 April 2014 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report.
The directors have no present intention to exercise this authority.
In line with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers, sub-paragraph b of Resolution 16, if passed, will authorise the directors to allot additional shares in connection with a rights issue having an aggregate nominal value of up to 1,621,788.50, representing approximately one third of the Companys issued share capital as at 22 April 2014 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report.
The directors have no present intention to exercise the authority sought under sub-paragraph b of Resolution 16, however, if such authority is obtained, it will give the Company greater flexibility to allot additional shares for the purpose of a pre-emptive rights issue.
This authority will be used when the directors consider it to be in the best interests of shareholders.
The authorities sought under Resolution 16 will expire on the earlier of 31 July 2015 being the latest date by which the Company must hold its annual general meeting in 2015 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2015.
Resolution 17 Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights If the directors wish to allot new shares for cash, the Companies Act 2006 states that the shares must be offered first to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.
For legal, regulatory and practical reasons, however, it might not be possible or desirable for shares allotted by means of a pre-emptive offer to be offered to certain shareholders, particularly those resident overseas.
Furthermore, it might in some circumstances be in the Companys interests for the directors to be able to allot some shares for cash without having to offer them first to existing shareholders.
To enable this to be done, shareholders statutory pre-emption rights must be disapplied.
Accordingly, Resolution 17, if passed, will empower the directors to allot a limited number of new equity securities without shareholders statutory pre-emption rights applying to such allotment.
The authority conferred by Resolution 17 would also cover the sale of treasury shares for cash.
Sub-paragraph a of Resolution 17 would confer authority on the directors to make any arrangements which may be necessary to deal with any legal, regulatory or practical problems arising on a rights issue, an open offer or any other pre-emptive offer in favour of ordinary shareholders, for example, by excluding certain overseas shareholders from such issue or offer.
Sub-paragraph b of Resolution 17 would disapply shareholders statutory pre-emption rights by empowering the directors to allot equity securities for cash on a non pre-emptive basis but only new equity securities having a maximum aggregate nominal value of 243,268, representing approximately 5% of the Companys issued share capital as at 22 April 2014 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report.
The authority sought under Resolution 17 will expire on the earlier of 31 July 2015 being the latest date by which the Company must hold an annual general meeting in 2015 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2015.
