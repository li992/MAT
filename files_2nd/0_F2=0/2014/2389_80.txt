Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans money purchase schemes or defined benefit plans final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension benefit payments.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to accounting for these plans see Pensions and other post-retirement benefits within Note 1.
The primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, including an independent director and an independent chairman nominated by the company.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
The UK plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
In the US, a range of retirement arrangements is provided.
Historically this has included a funded final salary pension plan for certain heritage employees and a cash balance arrangement for new joiners, but with effect from 2015 all employees who are members of the final salary pension plan accrue benefits only under a cash balance arrangement.
Retired US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment.
The plans assets are overseen by a fiduciary investment committee composed of seven BP employees appointed by the president of BP Corporation North America Inc. the appointing officer.
The investment committee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as the investment policies of the plan.
US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined contribution 401k plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.
In the US, group companies also provide postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees and their dependants: the entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum period of service.
In the Eurozone, there are defined benefit pension plans in Germany, France, the Netherlands and other countries.
In Germany and France, the majority of the pensions are unfunded, in line with market practice.
In Germany, the groups largest Eurozone plan, employees receive a pension and also have a choice to supplement their core pension through salary sacrifice.
For employees who joined since 2002 the core pension benefit is a career average plan with retirement benefits based on such factors as employees pensionable salary and length of service.
The returns on the notional contributions made by both the company and employees are set out in German tax law.
Retired German employees take their pension benefit typically in the form of an annuity.
The German plan is governed by a legal agreement between BP and the works council.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2014 the aggregate level of contributions was $1,252 million 2013 $1,272 million and 2012 $1,275 million.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2015 is expected to be approximately $1,250 million, and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make contributions by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
For the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the group and the trustee.
On an annual basis the latest funding position is reviewed and a schedule of contributions covering the next five years is agreed.
The funding agreement can be terminated unilaterally by either party with two years notice.
The minimum funding requirement therefore represents seven years of future contributions, which amounted to $4,720 million at 31 December 2014.
This amount is included in the groups committed cash flows relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefit plans as set out in the table of contractual obligations on page 212.
There are no such minimum funding requirements after this seven-year period, and the obligation is taken into account in the determination of the amount of any pension plan surplus recognized on the balance sheet.
Contributions in the US are determined by legislation and are supplemented by discretionary contributions.
All of the contributions made into the US plan in 2014 were discretionary and no statutory funding requirement is expected in the next 12 months.
There was no minimum funding requirement for the US plan, and no significant minimum funding requirements in other countries at 31 December 2014.
The obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2014.
The groups principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK, with valuations being required more frequently in many other countries.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the UK pension plans was as at 31 December 2011 and a valuation as at 31 December 2014 is currently under way.
A valuation of the US plan is carried out annually.
The material financial assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations of the various plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate the accrued benefit obligation at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.
% Financial assumptions used to determine benefit obligation UK US Eurozone 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Discount rate for plan liabilities 3.6 4.6 4.4 3.7 4.3 3.3 2.0 3.6 3.5 Rate of increase in salaries 4.5 5.1 4.9 4.0 3.9 4.2 3.4 3.4 3.4 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.0 3.3 3.1 1.8 1.8 1.8 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.0 3.3 3.1 0.7 0.7 0.7 Inflation for plan liabilities 3.0 3.3 3.1 1.6 2.1 2.4 2.0 2.0 2.0 Financial assumptions used to determine benefit expense UK US Eurozone 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Discount rate for plan service cost 4.8 4.4 4.8 4.6 3.3 4.3 3.9 3.5 4.8 Discount rate for plan other finance expense 4.6 4.4 4.8 4.3 3.3 4.3 3.6 3.5 4.8 Inflation for plan service cost 3.4 3.1 3.2 2.1 2.4 1.9 2.0 2.0 2.0 The discount rate assumptions are based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and for our largest plans in the UK, US and the Eurozone we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
The inflation rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds.
The Eurozone inflation rate assumption is based on the central bank inflation target.
In other countries we use one of these approaches, or advice from the local actuary depending on the information available.
The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.
136 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2014 Financial statements 22.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued The assumptions for the rate of increase in salaries are based on the inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
These include allowance for promotion-related salary growth, of up to 1.0% depending on country.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions, and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
BPs most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and the Eurozone where our mortality assumptions are as follows: Years Mortality assumptions UK US Eurozone 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 28.3 27.8 27.7 25.6 24.9 24.9 24.7 24.4 24.3 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 30.9 30.7 30.6 27.4 26.4 26.3 27.3 26.9 26.9 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 29.4 29.5 29.4 29.1 26.5 26.4 28.7 28.5 28.5 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 31.8 32.2 32.1 30.9 27.3 27.3 31.1 30.7 30.6 Pension plan assets are generally held in trusts.
The primary objective of the trusts is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the various plans.
The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term of such assets with an acceptable level of risk.
In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.
The current asset allocation policy for the major plans is as follows: UK US Asset category %% Total equity including private equity 70 60 Bonds cash 23 40 Property real estate 7 The groups main pension plans do not invest directly in either securities or property real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
Some of the groups pension plans use derivative financial instruments as part of their asset mix to manage the level of risk.
For the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to reduce the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increase the proportion held as bonds over time, with a view to better matching of the asset portfolio with the pension liabilities.
There is a similar agreement in place in the US.
BPs principal plans in the UK and US do not currently follow a liability driven investment approach, a form of investing designed to match the movement in pension plan assets with the movement in projected benefit obligations over time.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued The fair values of the various categories of assets held by the defined benefit plans at 31 December are presented in the table below, including the effects of derivative financial instruments.
Movements in the fair value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 139.
Property held by the UK pension plans is in the United Kingdom.
