Mining method: OP Open Pit, UG Underground.
Reserve Life The scheduled extraction period in years for the total Ore Reserves in the approved Life of Mine Plan.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
188 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES NIOBIUM estimates as at 31 December 2014 EXPLANATORY NOTES Boa Vista Oxide Ore Reserves OP : The remaining Oxide Ore Reserves will be extracted as part of the combined Oxide and Fresh Rock mine plan.
Phosphate Tailings Ore Reserves: The fines portion of the Phosphate tailings from Chapado are processed in the Niobium Tailings Plant to recover Niobium.
Theincrease is a result of optimisation of the Boa Vista Fresh Rock pit design enabling the tailings plant to continue operating once the Oxide Reserves are depleted.
Boa Vista Oxide Mineral Resources OP : The decrease is due to conversion of Mineral Resource to Ore Reserves as a result of the increased size of the Fresh Rock pit.
The Oxide Mineral Resources are reported above a 0.5 %Nb O cut-off.
2 5 Boa Vista Fresh Rock Ore Reserves OP : The increase is due to the optimisation of the pit design.
The project is in the ramp-up phase.
Area Leste Oxide Mineral Resources: The Oxide Resources are reported above a 0.5 %Nb O cut-off.
2 5 Area Leste Fresh Rock Mineral Resources: The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.7 %Nb O cut-off.
2 5 Boa Vista Fresh Rock Mineral Resources OP : The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.5 %Nb O cut-off.
The decrease is the result of conversion 2 5 of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves as a result of the optimisation of the pit design.
Additional Mineral Resource estimates using an underground mining method asthe basis for reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction are: Inferred Resources: 106kt Contained Product 10.7 Mt at 0.99 %Nb O.
2 5 Mina I Oxide Mineral Resources: The Oxide Resources are reported above a 0.5 %Nb O cut-off.
2 5 Mina II Fresh Rock Mineral Resources: The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.5 %Nb O cut-off.
The application of an open pit mining method is 2 5 the basis for reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction of this material.
The decrease is due to a change in the planned pit slope angle which reduces the volume of the Resource Shell.
A new block model has been completed but the underground design study demonstrating the viability of the extension to the orebody has not been completed yet.
No Mineral Resource estimates are therefore declared using an underground mining method asthe basis for reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
Morro do Padre Fresh Rock Mineral Resources: The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.7 %Nb O cut-off.
Application of underground mining 2 5 method is the basis for defining reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction of this material.
Following the reclassification of historical estimates to the Inferred category in order to ensure compliance with Anglo American standards, a systematic programme of re-analysis of historical samples and additional drilling is ongoing to upgrade the confidence in the project resources.
