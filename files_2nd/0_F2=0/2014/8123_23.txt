EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE On 7 November 2014, the Group announced that it had entered into binding agreements to sell its 19% holding in SkyWave to ORBCOMM Inc. for total proceeds of $32.9m.
Subsequently, the sale closed on 2 January 2015.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group reclassied the investment in SkyWave to assets held for sale and remeasured the asset to fair market value, recognising an after-tax gain of $8.0m, in other comprehensive income.
The gain was reclassied to profit in 2015.
During 2014, LightSquared elected to restart Phase 2 of the Cooperation Agreement and as a result, recommenced quarterly payments to Inmarsat.
On 2 January 2015, Inmarsat issued a default notice to LightSquared indicating the $17.5m payment due 31 December 2014 had not been received in accordance with the quarterly payment schedule.
However, this payment was subsequently received on 25 February 2015.
As at 31 December 2014, no revenue had been recognised in respect of the payment owing from LightSquared, due to the uncertainty of receiving the payment.
Subsequent to 31 December 2014, other than the events discussed above, there have been no other material events which would affect the information reected in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
