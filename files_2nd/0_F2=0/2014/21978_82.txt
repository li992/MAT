Hedging activities Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash ow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Cash ow hedges Instruments designated in a cash ow hedge include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps hedging Euro and US Dollar denominated borrowings.
Forward currency contracts are taken out to hedge step up interest on currency denominated borrowings relating to our 2030 US Dollar bond.
The hedged cash ows will affect profit or loss as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the borrowings.
See note 6 Loans and other borrowings.
Forecast foreign currency purchases, principally denominated in US Dollar and Asia Pacic currencies and purchases of US Dollar denominated retail devices are hedged 12 months forward on a one month rolling basis.
The related cash ows will be recognised in the income statement over this period.
All cash ow hedges were fully effective in the period.
See note 11 for details of the movements in the cash ow hedge reserve.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the 2028 Sterling bond due to movements in market interest rates.
Gains and losses arising on fair value hedges are disclosed in note 11.
Other derivatives The companys policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classied as held for trading and held at fair value through profit or loss under IAS 39.
