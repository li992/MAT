Vodafone Group Plc Strategy Additional 200 Annual Report 2014 Overview review Performance Governance Financials information 201 Non-GAAP information In the discussion of our reported financial position, operating results and cash flows, information is presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management.
However, this additional information presented is not uniformly defined by all companies including those in the Groups industry.
Accordingly, it may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies.
Additionally, certain information presented is derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure.
Such non-GAAP measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure.
Management basis The discussion of our operating results and cash flows in the strategic report is shown on a management basis, consistent with how the business is managed, operated and reviewed by management, and includes the results of the Groups joint ventures, Vodafone Italy, Vodafone Hutchison Australia, Vodafone Fiji and Indus Towers, on a proportionate basis.
This differs to the Consolidated financial statements on pages 96 to 170 which are presented on a statutory basis, and includes the results of the Groups joint ventures using the equity accounting basis.
We believe that the management basis metrics, which are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, our reported metrics, provide useful and necessary information to investors and other interested parties as they are used internally for performance analysis and resource allocation purposes of the operations where we have control or joint control.
A reconciliation of the key operating metrics on a management basis to the statutory results are summarised below and provided in detail in note 2 Segmental analysis to the consolidated financial statements.

We use EBITDA, in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted operating profit, operating profit and net profit, to assess our operating performance.
We believe that EBITDA is an operating performance measure, not a liquidity measure, as it includes non-cash changes in working capital and is reviewed by the Chief Executive to assess internal performance in conjunction with EBITDA margin, which is an alternative sales margin figure.
We believe it is both useful and necessary to report EBITDA as a performance measure as it enhances the comparability of profit across segments.
Because EBITDA does not take into account certain items that affect operations and performance, EBITDA has inherent limitations as a performance measure.
To compensate for these limitations, we analyse EBITDA in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP operating performance measures.
EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a GAAP measure of operating performance.
A reconciliation of EBITDA to the closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit, is provided in above and in note 2 Segmental analysis to the consolidated financial statements.
Group adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share Group adjusted operating profit excludes non-operating income of associates, impairment losses, restructuring costs, amortisation of customer bases and brand intangible assets, other operating income and expense and other significant one-off items.
Adjusted earnings per share also excludes certain foreign exchange rate differences, together with related tax effects.
We believe that it is both useful and necessary to report these measures for the following reasons: a these measures are used for internal performance reporting: a these measures are used in setting director and management remuneration: and a they are useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.
A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit, is provided above and in note 2 Segmental analysis to the consolidated financial statements.
A reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share to basic earnings per share, is provided in the Operating Review on page 45.
Vodafone Group Plc 202 Annual Report 2014 Non-GAAP information continued Cash flow measures In presenting and discussing our reported results, free cash flow and operating free cash flow are calculated and presented even though these measures are not recognised within IFRS.
We believe that it is both useful and necessary to communicate free cash flow to investors and other interested parties, for the following reasons: a free cash flow allows us and external parties to evaluate our liquidity and the cash generated by our operations.
Free cash flow does not include payments for licences and spectrum included within intangible assets, items determined independently of the ongoing business, such as the level of dividends, and items which are deemed discretionary, such as cash flows relating to acquisitions and disposals or financing activities.
Inaddition, it does not necessarily reflect the amounts which we have an obligation to incur.
However, it does reflect the cash available for such discretionary activities, to strengthen the consolidated statement of financial position or to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends or share purchases: a free cash flow facilitates comparability of results with other companies although our measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable tosimilarly titled measures used by other companies: a these measures are used by management for planning, reporting and incentive purposes: and a these measures are useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.
A reconciliation of cash generated by operations, the closest equivalent GAAP measure, to operating free cash flow and free cash flow, is provided below.

Certain of the statements within the section titled Guidance on pages 13 and 39 contain forward-looking non-GAAP financial information which at this time cannot be quantitatively reconciled to comparable GAAP financial information.
Organic growth All amounts in this document marked with an represent organic growth which presents performance on a comparable basis, both in terms ofmerger and acquisition activity and foreign exchange rates.
We believe that organic growth, which is not intended to be a substitute for or superior to reported growth, provides useful and necessary information to investors and other interested parties for the following reasons: a it provides additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of certain factors unrelated to the operating performance of the business: a it is used for internal performance analysis: and a it facilitates comparability of underlying growth with other companies, although the term organic is not a defined term under IFRS and may not, therefore, be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
