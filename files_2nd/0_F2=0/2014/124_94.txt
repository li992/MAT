The defined benefit entitlement for R. A.
White and A. L. Memmott for the year to 26 January 2013 has been reported as nil.
White, the increase in the accrued pension for the year to 26 January 2013 net of CPI inflation was calculated by comparing the accrued pension at 26 January 2013 of 64,704 with accrued pension at 28 January 2012 of 64,035 increased in line with CPI over the period from September 2010 to September 2011 5.22%.
