FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 77 Notes to the Group financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation Accounting policies The audited consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations IFRICs as adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Mans principal accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group in the preparation of the financial statements.
Accounting policies are included in the relevant sections, and significant policies are provided below.
The impact of new accounting standards and amendments applicable tothe year ended 31 December 2014 and accounting standards that are not yet effective are outlined below.
Consolidated group and presentation currency The consolidated group is Man Group plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group or Man.
The stand-alone Parent Company financial statements of Man Group plc have been included as separate financial statements, starting on page 115.
The majority of revenues, assets, liabilities and funding are denominated in United States Dollars USD and therefore Mans presentation currency is USD.
The consolidated financial information contained within these financial statements incorporates the results, cash flows and financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 31 December 2014.
Subsidiaries are entities including structured entities controlled by Man and are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Man until the date that control ceases.
Control exists when Man has the power to direct the relevant activities, exposure to significant variable returns and the ability to utilise power to affect those returns.
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value at theacquisition date of assets transferred, liabilities incurred, and equity instruments issued by the Group.
The fair value of an acquisition is calculated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities at their fair values at that date.
Costs relating to acquisitions are recognised in the Group income statement as incurred.
The acquisition date is the date on which Man effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration will be recognised in the Group income statement and classified as an adjusting item.
Mans relationship with independent fund entities Man acts as the investment manager advisor to fund entities.
Man assesses such relationships on an ongoing basis to determine whether each fund entity is controlled and therefore consolidated into the Groups results.
Having considered all significant aspects of Mans relationships with fund entities, the directors are of the opinion that, although Man manages the assets of certain fund entities, where Man does not hold an investment in the fund entity the characteristics of control are not met, and that for most fund entities: the existence of independent boards of directors at the fund entities: rights which allow for the removal of the investment manager advisor: the influence of investors: limited exposure to variable returns: and the arms length nature of Mans contracts with the fund entities, indicate that Man does not control the fund entities and their associated assets, liabilities and results should not be consolidated into the Group financial statements.
Assessment of the control characteristics for all relationships with fund entities led to the consolidation of five fund entities for the year ended 31 December 2014 2013: one, as detailed in Note 15.
An understanding of the aggregate funds under management FUM and the fees earned from the fund entities is relevant to an understanding of Mans results and earnings sustainability and this information is provided in the Chief Financial Officers review on page 16.
Judgemental areas and accounting estimates The determination of fair values for contingent consideration in relation to the Numeric, Pine Grove and FRM acquisitions Note 12 and the valuation of goodwill and intangibles Note 12, whether the Group controls certain funds through its investments in fund products and is required to consolidate them Note 15.3, recognition of deferred tax assets Note 9 and taxation liabilities Note 9 are the most significant areas of judgement and have been an area of focus for the Group Board, and in particular the Audit and Risk Committee, during the year.
The report of the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee discusses the involvement of the Committee in this evaluation on page 39.
Going concern Mans business activity is discussed on pages 1 to 29, together with the significant risk factors pages 22 to 25.
Mans liquidity and capital positions are set out in Note 14 and 22 respectively.
The directors monitor Mans capital and liquidity positions and forecasts throughout the year, and in addition they have approved a budget, medium-term financial plan, and a capital and liquidity plan, which cover the foreseeable future and include rigorous analysis of stressed capital and liquidity scenarios.
The directors have concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that Man has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Group and Parent financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of certain financial instruments that are available-for-sale or held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial reporting controls The Groups systems of internal control aim to safeguard assets, ensure that proper accounting records are maintained, and ensure that the financial information used in the business and published externally is robust and reliable.
The financial reporting controls comply with the guidance given in Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code.
The Corporate governance report is provided on pages 32 to 37.

IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements is the revised consolidation accounting standard, which became effective from 1 January 2014.
Theadoption of this standard has resulted in the consolidation of one fund at 31 December 2013 and five funds at 31 December 2014.
These funds are classified on the balance sheet as non-current assets liabilities held for sale Note 15.
The impact of consolidating these funds is an increase inthegross assets and liabilities on the Group balance sheet of around $33 million.
There is no impact on the Group income statement.
In considering the principles of IFRS 10, Man has redefined associates to exclude fund entities where Man is acting as Agent and therefore we do nothave significant influence.
Accordingly, these fund entities are no longer considered related parties as defined in International Accounting Standard 24 Related Parties.
This change has resulted in amended disclosures in Note 28.
There is no impact on the Group income statement or Group balance sheet.
IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities became effective from 1 January 2014.
As a result of the adoption of this standard, additional information about the risk exposure from structured entities, which we have defined as fund entities for which Man is the investment manager, isprovided in Note 15.
Other relevant new standards adopted by Man in the current year, which have not had a significant impact, are: IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate financial statements IAS 28 revised 2011 Investments in associates and joint ventures Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of assets There are no new or revised standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective as endorsed by the EU which are expected to have asignificant impact on the Group financial statements of Man.
Changes in presentation A change in presentation of the balance sheet has been made in the period to separate provisions from trade and other payables, and to provide asummary of movements in provisions for the year Note 18.
Adjusted profit before tax Statutory profit before tax is adjusted to give a fuller understanding of the underlying profitability of the business.
The directors consider that the Groups profit is most meaningful when considered on a basis which excludes restructuring costs, impairment of assets, acquisition and disposal related Items including non-cash items such as amortisation of purchased intangible assets and deferred tax movements relating to the recognition of tax losses in the US and certain non-recurring gains or losses, which therefore reflect the recurring revenues and costs that drive the Groups cash flow.
The directors are consistent in their approach to the classification of adjusting items period to period, maintaining an appropriate symmetry between losses and gains and the reversal of any accruals previously classified as adjusting items.
These are explained in detail either below or intherelevant note.
MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 79 2.

The 2014 credit of $6 million relates to reassessment of potential legal claims Note 18.
In 2014 litigation, regulatory and other settlements relates to legal claims, including associated costs.
In 2013 the $14 million primarily relates to the settlement of a regulatory enquiry in the US and directly associated legal costs.
The acquisition related compensation and other costs relate to staff termination, legal and other advisory fees relating to the Numeric and Pine Grove transactions, as well as the costs of integrating our operating platforms Note 12 and Note 18.
Compensation costs incurred as part of restructuring are accounted for in full at the time the obligation arises, following communication of the formal plan, and include payments in lieu of notice, enhanced termination costs, and accelerated share-based payment and fund product based charges.
The revaluation of the FRM contingent consideration is an adjustment to the fair value of expected FRM earn-out payments, resulting primarily from movements in net management fee run rates since the acquisition of FRM, and has been included within income or gains on investments and other financial instruments.
The unwind of the discount on contingent consideration in 2014 relates to FRM $3 million, Numeric $3 million and Pine Grove $1 million contingent consideration since the respective acquisition dates Note 12, and is included within finance expense Note 8.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles primarily relates to investment management contracts and brands recognised on the acquisition of GLG and FRM, with amortisation charges of $7 million in 2014 relating to the newly acquired Numeric and Pine Grove intangibles Note 12.
The $4 million loss on disposal of subsidiaries and other interests in 2014 is the result of the Group selling two of its subsidiaries to local management in May 2014.
The prior period $11 million gain on disposal relates primarily to the disposal of a 6.25% stake in Nephila in January 2013, reducing our stake to 18.75%.
In 2013, some of the Groups foreign subsidiaries were liquidated, which had accumulated foreign currency translation reserves of $1 million at the date of liquidation.
Upon liquidation of these subsidiaries the related foreign currency translation was recycled to the Group income statement.
In the prior year the FRM goodwill was impaired by $69 million, primarily relating to our legacy Man Multi-Manager Business Note 12.
In 2014, the $1 million of restructuring costs relates to an onerous lease on our New York property.
The $36 million of compensation restructuring costs recognised in 2013 relate to the further phase of cost saving initiatives announced on 2 August 2013.
Other costs relating to restructuring in 2013 primarily relate to onerous property lease provisions, largely in relation to Riverbank House our main London office and headquarters.
The prior year accelerated depreciation included within Other costs primarily relates to leasehold improvements and equipment as a result of the sub-letting of office space in Riverbank House.
During 2013, $5 million of additional proceeds were received relating to the disposal of the Lehman claims in 2012.
MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 80 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 3.
Revenue Fee income is Mans primary source of revenue, which is derived from the investment management agreements that we have in place with the fund entities.
Fees are generally based on an agreed percentage of the valuation of FUM and are typically charged in arrears.
Management fees net of rebates, which include all non-performance related fees and interest income from loans to fund products, are recognised in the year in which the services are provided.
Performance fees net of rebates relate to the performance of the funds managed during the year and are recognised when the quantum of the feecanbe estimated reliably and has crystallised.
This is generally at the end of the performance period or upon early redemption by a fund investor.
Until the performance period ends market movements could significantly move the net asset value NAV of the fund products.
Man will typically only earn performance fee income on any positive investment returns in excess of the high water mark, meaning we will not be able to earn performance fee income with respect to positive investment performance in any year following negative performance until that loss is recouped, at which point afund investors investment surpasses the high water mark.
Distribution costs Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2014 2013 Distribution costs 104 145 Distribution costs paid to external intermediaries are directly related to their marketing activity and the investors serviced by them.
The distribution expense is therefore variable with FUM and the associated management fee income.
Distribution costs, before adjusting items, of $104 million 2013: $145 million comprise product placement fees of $15 million 2013: $15 million andinvestor servicing fees of $89 million 2013: $130 million.
Servicing fees have decreased primarily as a result of the roll-off of guaranteed product FUM and a mix shift towards institutional assets, particularly in the quant alternatives category.
Placement fees are paid for product launches or sales and are capitalised and amortised over the expected investment holding period Note 13.
Investor servicing fees are paid to intermediaries for ongoing investor servicing and are expensed as incurred.
Asset services Asset services include valuations, fund accounting, and registrar functions performed by third parties under contract to Man, on behalf of the funds.
The cost of these services is based on the number of transactions or FUM, and is therefore variable with activity levels and FUM.
Asset services costs for the year are $27 million compared to $32 million in 2013.
The decrease in asset services costs is primarily a result of contract renegotiations in the latter half of 2014.
Compensation Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2014 2013 Salaries 136 163 Variable cash compensation 174 186 Share-based payment charge 12 30 Fund product based payment charge 30 32 Social security costs 33 24 Pension costs 6 10 Compensation costs before adjusting items 391 445 Acquisition related costs 3 Restructuring 36 Total compensation costs 394 481 Compensation is our largest cost and an important component of our ability to retain and attract talent at Man.
In the short term the variable component of compensation adjusts with revenues and profitability.
In the medium term the active management of headcount can reduce fixed compensation, if required.
MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 81 6.
Compensation continued Compensation costs in total are $391 million, before adjusting items, or 36% of net revenue 2013: 42%.
Net revenue is defined as gross management and other fees, performance fees, income or gains on investments and other financial instruments, share of after tax profit of associates, less external distribution costs.
Salaries and variable cash compensation are charged to the Group income statement in the year in which they are incurred, and include partner drawings.
Fixed compensation and benefits are $155 million compared to $188 million in the prior year.
Fixed compensation comprises salaries, pension costs and a portion of the social security costs.
The current year includes Numeric and Pine Grove fixed compensation from 5 September 2014 and4August 2014 respectively, the dates of acquisition.
Variable compensation is $236 million compared to $257 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting lower performance fee related compensation andthe change in application of the policy for deferred awards, as discussed in the next paragraph.
The directors have determined that going forward all share-based and fund product-based awards relate entirely to future services, which is consistent with the approach currently adopted for GLG awards, and hence the amortisation charge relating to all future awards will be spread over the vesting period from the date of grant.
The revised application of the deferred compensation policy results in a lower charge to the income statement of around $17 million in 2014, compared to the approach applied previously.
The accounting for share-based and fund product based compensation arrangements is covered in Note 21.
The unamortised deferred compensation at year end is $22 million 2013: $24 million which has a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.3 years 2013: 1.4 years.
Pension costs relate to Mans defined contribution and defined benefit plans Note 23.

Other costs continued The level of expenses, including occupancy, communication, technology and travel and entertainment, is linked to headcount.
Other costs, before depreciation and amortisation and adjusting items, are $150 million in the year, compared to $191 million in the prior year, which reflects the impact of the previously announced cost savings programme.
Auditors remuneration, including advisory and professional services, is disclosed in more detail in the Corporate governance section on page 41.

Income and profits are allocated to these different jurisdictions based on transfer pricing methodologies set in accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
The effective tax rate results from the combination of taxes paid on earnings attributable to the tax jurisdictions in which they arise.
The majority of the Groups profit was earned in the UK and Switzerland.
The current effective tax rate of 5% 2013: -29% differs from the underlying rate principally as a result of the release of a tax liability of $25 million and recognition of a US deferred tax asset of $8 million, which are detailed below.
The effective tax rate is otherwise consistent with this earnings profile.
The effective tax rate on adjusted profits Note 2 is 10% 2013: 7%.
The higher rate is principally the result of the effect of credits to the tax charge in respect of previous periods of a similar value to 2013 having a smaller impact on the higher profits in 2014.
MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 83 9.
Taxation continued The tax on Mans total profit before tax is lower than the amount that would arise using the theoretical effective tax rate applicable to profits losses ofthe consolidated companies as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2014 2013 Profit before tax 384 56 Theoretical tax charge at UK rate: 21.50% 2013: 23.25% 83 13 Effect of: Overseas rates compared to UK 20 14 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods 30 33 Impairment of goodwill and other adjusting items 1 19 Share-based payments 3 10 Initial recognition of US deferred tax asset 8 Other 2 11 Total tax charge credit 19 16 In the current year the adjustments to the tax charge in respect of previous periods largely relates to the release of $25 million due to reassessment of tax exposures associated with our Asia Pacific operations.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates expected to be applied when the deferred tax asset or liability is realised.
Movements in deferred tax are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2014 2013 Deferred tax liability At 1 January 97 114 Credit to the income statement 14 17 Deferred tax liability at 31 December 83 97 Deferred tax asset At 1 January 39 43 Credit to the income statement 8 10 Credit charge directly to equity 2 10 Other currency differences 2 4 Deferred tax asset at 31 December 47 39 The deferred tax liability of $83 million 2013: $97 million relates to deferred tax arising on acquired intangible assets.
The deferred tax asset of $47 million 2013: $39 million principally relates to US tax losses and intangible assets of $8 million 2013: nil, defined benefitpension schemes of $8 million 2013: $9 million, employee share schemes of $17 million 2013: $7 million, and tax allowances over depreciation of $14 million 2013: $18 million.
The deferred tax asset income statement credit of $8 million 2013: $10 million relates to initial recognition of the deferred tax asset in respect of US losses of $8 million 2013: nil, an increase in the deferred tax asset on employee share schemes of $7 million 2013: nil, a decrease in the deferred tax asset arising on tax allowances over depreciation of $4 million 2013: $9 million decrease andadecrease in the deferred tax liability on other temporary differences of $3 million 2013: $1 million increase.
The credit to other revenue reserves of $2 million 2013:charge of $10 million relates to movements in the pension accrual and employee share schemes in the year.
MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 84 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 9.
Taxation continued The Group has accumulated deferred tax assets in the US of $191 million.
These assets principally comprise accumulated operating losses from existing operations and future amortisation of goodwill and intangibles assets generated from acquisitions that will be available to offset future taxable profits in the US.
These assets have not been recognised on the balance sheet in the past because the US business as a whole was loss making, andtherefore there was no clear evidence that the business would be able to benefit from these tax assets.
As at 31 December 2014, a proportion $8million of these previously unrecognised deferred tax assets has been recognised, triggered by the acquisition of Numeric, which gives rise to a higher degree of certainty that the US business will earn taxable profits in future periods.
The $8 million deferred tax asset recognised in 2014 represents amounts which can be offset against probable future taxable profits, which are considered to be forecast profits for the next three years only consistent with the Groups business planning horizon.
As a result of the recognised deferred tax asset and the remaining unrecognised available US deferred tax assets of $183 million 2013: $188 million, Man does not expect to pay federal tax on any taxable profits it may earn in theUS for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, any movements in this US tax asset are classified as an adjusting item in Note 2 such as the credit totaxexpense of $8 million recognised in 2014.
Earnings per ordinary share EPS The calculation of basic EPS is based on post-tax profit and for 2013, after payments to holders of the perpetual subordinated capital securities of$19million after tax of $365 million compared to a profit of $53 million in the prior year, and ordinary shares of 1,754,177,715 2013: 1,787,851,123, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares on issue during the period after excluding the shares owned by the Man Employee Trusts.
Fordiluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, being ordinary shares of 1,778,702,369 2013: 1,818,402,923.

MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 86 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 12.
Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business at the date ofacquisition.
Goodwill is carried on the Group balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment.
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Investment management contracts, distribution channels and brand names Investment management contracts IMCs, distribution channels and brand names are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives, which are between 5 and 13 years.
Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units For statutory accounting impairment review purposes, the Group has identified four cash generating units CGUs : GLG, AHL, FRM and Numeric.
Thegoodwill and other intangible assets acquired as part of the Pine Grove acquisition have been allocated to the FRM CGU as the acquired Pine Grove business has been fully integrated with the FRM business.
The Numeric acquisition is detailed below.
The Man Systematic Strategies business MSS was integrated into the AHL business on 1 January 2013, and associated goodwill of $71 million was transferred from the GLG and FRM CGUs to the AHL CGU at that date.
Calculation of recoverable amounts for cash generating units The recoverable amounts of the Groups CGUs are assessed each year using a value in use calculation.
The value in use calculation gives a higher valuation compared to a fair value less cost to sell approach, as this would exclude some of the revenue synergies available to Man through its ability to distribute products using its well established distribution channels, which may not be fully available to other market participants.
The value in use calculations at 31 December 2014 use cash flow projections based on the Board approved financial plan for the year to 31 December 2015 and a further two years of projections 2016 and 2017 plus a terminal value.
The valuation analysis is based on best practice guidance whereby a terminal value is calculated at the end of a short discrete budget period and assumes, after this three year budget period, no growth in asset flows above the long-term growth rate.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are represented by the compound average annualised growth in FUM over the three yearbudget period and the discount rates applied to the modelled cash flows.
The value in use calculations are sensitive to small changes in the keyassumptions, in particular in relation to the compound average annualised growth in FUM over the three year forecast period.
Sensitivity analysis of this assumption is given in each of the GLG, AHL and FRM sections below.
The terminal value is calculated based on the projected closing FUM at 31December 2017 and applying a mid-point of a range of historical multiples to the forecast cash flows associated with management and performance fees.
A bifurcated discount rate has been applied to the modelled cash flows to reflect the different risk profile of net management fee income and net performance fee income.
The discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital using a risk free interest rate, together with an equity risk premium and an appropriate beta derived from consideration of Mans beta, similar alternative asset managers, and the asset management sector as a whole.
The post-tax discount rates applied are the same as those used in 2013.
The specific assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each of the CGUs are explained in the sections below.

Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued GLG cash generating unit For the year ended 31 December 2013 there was no impairment charge.
The recoverable amount of the GLG CGU has again been assessed at 31December 2014.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are shown in the table below.
Compound average annualised growth in FUM over three years 7% 1 Discount rate post-tax Net management fees 11% Net performance fees 17% 2 Terminal value mid-point of range of historical multiples, post-tax Management fees 13x Performance fees 5.5x Notes: 1 The pre-tax equivalent of the net management fee and net performance fee discount rates are 14% and 21% respectively.
2 The terminal value is equivalent to an overall terminal growth rate of 3% for management fees and 0% for performance fees.
The GLG value in use calculation at 31 December 2014 indicates a value of $800 million, with around $150 million of headroom over the carrying valueof the GLG business.
Therefore, no impairment charge is deemed necessary at 31 December 2014.
The valuation at 31 December 2014 is around $500 million lower than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2013, primarily as a result of lower than anticipated investment performance and net inflows in 2014, particularly for discretionary alternatives, and decreased growth in FUM anticipated over the next three yearsasresult of the 2014 performance.
The table below shows scenarios whereby the base case key assumptions are changed to stressed assumptions, indicating the modelled headroom or impairment that would result.
Each assumption, or set of assumptions, is stressed in isolation.
The results of these sensitivities make no allowance for actions that management would take if such market conditions persisted.

The valuation at 31 December 2014 isaround $1.7 billion higher than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2013, primarily as a result of strong investment performance in 2014, particularly for quant alternatives, better than anticipated net inflows, and higher growth in FUM anticipated over the next three years as a result .

Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued FRM cash generating unit The FRM CGU includes the legacy Man Multi-Manager business, the acquired FRM business and goodwill relating to the acquisition of Pine Grove during 2014.
For the year ended 31 December 2013 an impairment charge of $69 million was recognised as a result of guaranteed product FUM decreasing faster than expected and lower than anticipated FUM and flows, in particular due to redemptions in our legacy Multi-Manager Business.
The recoverable amount of the FRM CGU has again been assessed at 31 December 2014.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are shown inthetable below.
Compound average annualised growth in FUM over three years 9% 1 Discount rate post-tax Net management fees 11% Net performance fees 17% 2 Terminal value mid-point of range of historical multiples, post-tax Management fees 12x Performance fees 5x Notes: 1 The pre-tax equivalent of the net management fee and net performance fee discount rates are 13% and 20% respectively.
2 The terminal value is equivalent to an overall terminal growth rate of 2% for management fees and 0% for performance fees.
The FRM value in use calculation at 31 December 2014 indicates a value of $230 million, with around $40 million of headroom over the carrying value of the FRM business.
The valuation at 31 December 2014 is slightly higher than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2013, primarily as a result of better than anticipated net inflows for fund of fund products in 2014, in particular for managed account mandates, and higher growth in FUM anticipated over the next three years, which have been partially offset by a decline in management fee margins.
Despite an increase in the FRM CGU value in use, the valuation of the FRM contingent consideration has decreased by $17 million during 2014 Note 2.
This is the result of a decrease in the management fee run rate revenue of the legacy FRM business versus expectations, and does not take into account the impact of the significant cost base reduction of this business since acquisition.

Acquisition of Numeric On 5 September 2014 Man acquired Numeric Holdings LLC Numeric, a Boston-based quantitative equity manager with funds under management at the date of acquisition of $15.2 billion.
The consideration to Numeric owners is comprised of $219 million up-front and $19 million of balance sheet consideration paid in cash at completion, plus two earn-out style contingent consideration arrangements the Option Consideration payable post-acquisition.
Numeric Management are rolling over the majority of their consideration in return for an ongoing 18.3% equity interest in the business the Management Interests and have also been granted profits interests in the business that entitle them to share in 16.5% of the increase in the value of the Numeric business over the period prior to the exercise date for the put and call arrangement described below the Profit Interests.
At the end of five years following completion, Man will have an opportunity to acquire the Management Interests and the Profit Interests pursuant to a put and call option arrangement.
The maximum aggregate amount payable by Man in respect of the Option Consideration is capped at $275 million.
The call and put options structure means that it is virtually certain that Man will elect to, or be obliged to, purchase the interests held by Numeric management at five call option or five and a half put option years post-closing.
Therefore this element of the consideration is equivalent to an earn-out and is deemed to be a financial liability measured initially atfair value and any subsequent fair value movements recognised through the Group income statement Note 27.

These intangible assets are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows generated from the assets and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected life of 10 and 13 years respectively.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on acquisition as these intangibles are tax-deductible in the US.
Goodwill primarily represents future synergies from combining Mans global distribution capabilities with the existing Numeric business, Numerics skilled workforce, and the market share and positioning within the US quantitative domain.
Numerics strong performance track record underpins the implied goodwill within the acquired business.
Goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The newly acquired Numeric business isconsidered a separate CGU for future statutory accounting impairment review purposes.
Acquisition costs relating to staff termination, legal and other advisory fees, as well as the costs of integrating our operating platforms, have beenincurred as a result of the Numeric transaction.
These have been expensed and do not form part of goodwill, and are classified as adjusting items Note 2.
The pre-tax profit for the Numeric business since acquisition date is $19 million.
If Numeric had been acquired at the beginning of the financial year, the pre-tax profit for Numeric would have been $43 million, based on the post-acquisition expense structure and excluding any deal related costs.
Numeric revenue for the period since the acquisition date is $42 million including performance fee revenue of $23 million, and if the acquisition hadtaken place at the beginning of the financial year, the revenue would have been $94 million including performance fee revenue of $39 million.
Acquisition of Pine Grove On 4 August 2014, Man acquired the entire issued share capital of Pine Grove Asset Management LLC Pine Grove, a US based fund of hedge fund manager specialising in the management of credit-focused hedge fund portfolios with funds under management at the date of acquisition of$1.0billion.
The consideration to Pine Grove owners comprises $1 million in cash up-front and $5 million in August 2015, and contingent amounts based onmanagement fees earned, paid annually for five years post acquisition valued at $11 million.
The deferred consideration payable is equivalent to anearn-out and deemed to be a financial liability measured initially at fair value and any subsequent fair value movements recognised through the Group income statement Note 27.

Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued The fair value adjustments relate primarily to the recognition of investment management contracts of $13 million.
These intangible assets are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows generated from the assets and are amortised on a straight-line basis over theirexpected life of nine years.
Goodwill primarily represents the future incremental synergies from cost savings, Pine Groves skilled workforce and increased access to the USmarket.
Acquisition costs relating to staff termination, legal and other advisory fees, as well as the costs of integrating our operating platforms, have been incurred as a result of the Pine Grove transaction.
The pre-tax profit for the Pine Grove business since acquisition date is $2 million.
If Pine Grove had been acquired at the beginning of the financial year, the pre-tax profit for Pine Grove would have been $4 million, excluding any deal related costs.
Pine Grove revenue for the period since the acquisition date is $4 million, and if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, the revenue would have been $11 million.

The majority of placement fees paid up-front are capitalised as intangible assets which represent the contractual right to benefit from future income from providing investment management services.
The amortisation period is based on managements estimate of the weighted average period over which Man expects to earn economic benefits from the investor in each product, estimated to be five years on a straight-line basis.
If an investor redeems their investment in a fund product, the corresponding unamortised placement fee is written-off accelerated amortisation.
Theplacement fees intangible is also subject to a valuation assessment semi-annually to ensure that the future economic benefit arising from each fund product is in excess of the remaining unamortised balance.
Amortisation expense, including any accelerated charges, is included in distribution costs in the Group income statement.
The weighted average remaining period of the unamortised placement fees at 31 December 2014 is 1.9 years 31 December 2013: 1.5 years.
From a capital management perspective, capital is held against the unamortised balance of placement fees based on an evaluation of the risk of an accelerated amortisation charge relating to poor investment performance or early redemptions.
From a regulatory capital perspective placement fees are an intangible asset and are required to be supported by Tier 1 regulatory capital.
Capitalised computer software Costs that are directly associated with the procurement or development of identifiable and unique software products, which will generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as capitalised computer software.
Capitalised computer software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life three years and is subject to regular impairment reviews.
Amortisation of capitalised computer softwareis included in Other costs in the Group income statement.

Cash, liquidity and borrowings Liquidity and borrowings Total liquidity resources aggregate to $2,263 million at 31 December 2014 2013: $2,517 million and comprise cash and cash equivalents of $738million 2013: $992 million and the undrawn committed revolving credit facility of $1,525 million 2013: $1,525 million.
Cash and cash equivalents at year end comprises $291 million 2013: $291 million of cash at bank on hand, and $447 million 2013: $701 million in short-term deposits, netofoverdrafts of nil 2013: nil.
Cash ring-fenced for regulated entities totalled $24 million 2013: $16 million.
Liquidity resources support ongoing operations and potential liquidity requirements under stressed scenarios.
The amount of potential liquidity requirements is modelled based on scenarios that assume stressed market and economic conditions.
With the exception of committed purchase arrangements Note 29.1, the funding requirements for Man relating to the investment management process are discretionary.
The liquidity profile of Man is monitored on a daily basis and the stressed scenarios are updated regularly.
The Board reviews Mans funding resources at each Board meeting and on an annual basis as part of the strategic planning process.
Mans available liquidity is considered sufficient to cover currentrequirements and potential requirements under stressed scenarios.
Cash is invested in accordance with strict limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite, which consider both the security and availability of liquidity.
Accordingly, cash is held in short-term bank deposits and on-demand deposit bank accounts.
At 31 December 2014 the $738 million cash balance is held with 22 banks 2013: $992 million with 24 banks.
The single largest counterparty bank exposure of $100 million is held with an AArated bank 2013: $136 million with an AArated bank.
At 31 December 2014, balances with banks in the AA ratings band aggregate to $284 million 2013:$472million and balances with banks in the A ratings band aggregate to $453 million 2013: $520 million.
During 2013 Man repaid all of its previously outstanding borrowings and the perpetual subordinated capital securities.
On 16 September 2014 Man issued $150 million ten year fixed rate reset callable guaranteed subordinated notes Tier 2 notes, with associated issuance costs of $1 million.
The Tier 2 notes were issued with a fixed coupon of 5.875% until 15 September 2019.
The notes may be redeemed in whole at Mans option on 16 September 2019 at their principal amount, subject to FCA approval.
If the notes are not redeemed at this time then the coupon will reset to the five year mid-swap rate plus 4.076% and the notes will be redeemed on 16 September 2024 at their principal amount.

The difference between the amount repayable at maturity on the borrowings and the carrying value is amortised over the period up to the expected maturity of the associated debt in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
At 31 December 2014, the fair value of borrowings is $154 million 2013: nil.
In 2013 the senior fixed rate bonds and floating rate notes of $859 million were repurchased at a total premium of $26 million.
This premium, along with an accelerated unwind of issue costs and fees of $2 million, was included in finance expense in 2013.
The committed revolving credit facility of $1,525 million was put in place during July 2011 as a five year facility and included the option for Man to ask the banks to extend the maturity date by a year on each of the first and second anniversaries.
The participant banks had the option to accept or decline Mans request.
Before the second anniversary in July 2013 the banks were asked to extend the maturity date of the facility by a further year.
Banks with participations totalling $1,335 million accepted the request and as a result $70 million of the facility is currently scheduled to mature in July2016, $120 million in July 2017, and $1,335 million in July 2018.
To maintain maximum flexibility, the revolving credit facility does not include financial covenants.
Disclosures in relation to financial guarantees and commitments are included in Note 29.

Cash, liquidity and borrowings continued Foreign exchange and interest rate risk Man is subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities.
A 10% strengthening weakening ofthe US Dollar against all other currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a foreign exchange loss gain of $6 million 2013: $2 million loss gain, with a corresponding impact on equity.
This exposure is based on USD balances held by non-USD functional currency entities and non-USD balances held by USD functional currency entities within the Group.
In respect of Mans monetary assets and liabilities which earn incur interest indexed to floating rates, as at 31 December 2014, a 50bp increase decrease in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a $2 million increase or a $1 million decrease 2013: $3 million increase or $1 million decrease in net interest income.

Loans to fund products Loans to fund products are short-term advances primarily to Man guaranteed products, which are made to assist with the financing of the leverage associated with the structured products.
The loans are repayable on demand and are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The average balance during the year is $80 million 2013: $238 million.
Loans to fund products have decreased compared to the prior year as guaranteed product FUM has decreased together with the associated leveraging.
The liquidity requirements of guaranteed products together with commitments to provide financial support Note 29 which give rise to loans to funds are subject to our routine liquidity stress testing andany liquidity requirements are met by available cash resources, or the committed revolving credit facility.
Loans to fund products expose Man to credit risk and therefore the credit decision making process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The carrying value represents Mans maximum exposure to this credit risk.
Loans are closely monitored against the assets held in the funds.
The largest single loan to a fund product at 31 December 2014 is $14 million 2013: $12 million.
Fund entities are not externally rated, but our internal modelling indicates that fund products have a probability of default that is equivalent to a credit rating of A.
Other investments in fund products Man uses capital to invest in our fund products as part of our ongoing business to build our product breadth and to trial investment research developments before we market the products to investors.
These seeding investments are generally held for less than one year.
Where Man isdeemed not to control the fund, these are classified as other investments in fund products.
Other investments in fund products are classified primarily at fair value through profit or loss, with movements in fair value being recognised through income or gains on investments and other financialinstruments.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date.
Other investments in fund products are not actively traded and the valuation at the fund level cannot be determined by reference to other availableprices.
The fair values of investments in fund products are derived from the reported NAVs of each of the fund products, which in turn are based upon the value of the underlying assets held within each of the fund products and the anticipated redemption horizon of the fund product.
Thevaluation of the underlying assets within each fund product is determined by external valuation service providers based on an agreed valuation policyandmethodology.
MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 94 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 15.
Investments in fund products and other investments continued Whilst these valuations are performed independently of Man, Man has established oversight procedures and due diligence processes to ensure that the NAVs reported by the external valuation service providers are reliable and appropriate.
Man makes adjustments to these NAVs where the anticipated redemption horizon or events or circumstances indicate that the NAVs are not reflective of fair value.
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets is disclosed in Note 27.
Other investments in fund products expose Man to market risk and therefore this process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The largest single investment in fund products is $51 million 2013: $50 million.
The market risk from seeding investments is modelled using a value at risk methodology using a 95% confidence interval and one year time horizon.
The value at risk is estimated to be $26 million at 31 December 2014 2013: $19 million.
Fund investment for deferred compensation arrangements At 31 December 2014 investments in fund products included $68 million 2013: $61 million of fund products related to deferred compensation arrangements.
Employees are subject to mandatory deferral arrangements and as part of these arrangements employees can elect to have their deferral in a designated series of Man fund products.
The changes in the fair value of the fund product awards are recognised over the relevant vesting period, which means the compensation expense changes based on the value of the designated fund products.
The fund product investments are held to offset this change in compensation during the vesting period and at vesting the value of the fund investment is delivered to the employee.
Thefund product investments are recorded at fair value with any gains or losses during the vesting period recognised as income or gains on investments and other financial instruments in the Group income statement.
Non-current assets held for sale Seed capital invested into funds may at times be significant, and therefore the fund may be deemed to be controlled by the Group.
Where the Group acquired the controlling stake exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal through sale or dilution and it is considered highly probable that it will relinquish control within a year, the investment in the controlled fund is classified as held for sale.
The seeded fund is recognised in the Group balance sheet as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale, with the interests of any other parties included within non-current liabilities held for sale.
Amounts recognised are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The non-current assets and liabilities held for sale are as follows: 31 December 31 December $m 2014 2013 Non-current assets held for sale 186 56 Non-current liabilities held for sale 33 6 Investments in fund products held for sale 153 50 Investments cease to be classified as held for sale when the fund is no longer controlled by the Group, at which time they are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Note 15.2.
Loss of control may eventuate through sale of the investment or a dilution in the Groups holding.
If a held for sale fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year, and it is unlikely that the Group will reduce or no longer control itsinvestment in the short-term, it will cease to be classified as held for sale and will be consolidated on a line-by-line basis.
Structured entities A structured entity is an entity designed so that its activities are not governed by way of voting rights, for example where contractual arrangements arethe dominant factor in affecting an investors returns.
Man has evaluated all exposures and concluded that where Man holds an investment, loan, fees receivable, guarantee or commitment with an investment fund or a collateralised loan obligation, this represents an interest in a structured entity.
The activities of these entities are governed by investment management agreements or, in the case of a collateralised loan obligation, the indenture.
In determining whether Man controls a structured entity the directors focus on the purpose and design of the entity, the decision making rights as investment manager or advisor, the substantive rights to remove the fund manager or advisor and Mans aggregate economic interests in the form of interest held and exposure to variable returns.
Where Man does not hold an investment in the structured entity, Man considers that the characteristics of control are not met.
Furthermore, for managed accounts where we do not act as investment manager or advisor, and for illiquid investments purchased by Man where these are no longer actively traded or managed, Mans role in directing investment activities is diminished and therefore these are not considered to be structured entities.
MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 95 15.
Investments in fund products and other investments continued In most instances Mans decision making authority in its capacity as investment manager or advisor to these entities is well defined and discretion is exercised regarding the relevant activities.
These agreements include only terms, conditions or amounts that are customarily present in similar arrangements negotiated on an arms length basis, including management and performance fee arrangements.
Where the right to remove Man asinvestment manager without cause also exists, Man is acting as agent on behalf of the investors and therefore these entities are not consolidated intoMans results.
Man is considered to be acting as principal where Man is the investment manager or advisor and is able to make the investment decisions on behalf of the investors, has substantial exposure to variable returns through investments held and fee arrangements, and there are no substantive rights that would remove Man as investment manager or advisor.
Consolidated structured entities are detailed in Note 15.3 and Note 32.
Mans interest in and exposure to unconsolidated structured entities is as follows: Less Managed Total FUM Gross Maximum Accounts and Unconsolidated management exposure to Consolidated Structured Fair value of Fees Loans to fee margin loss Total FUM fund entities entities investment receivable funds 1 2 $bn $bn $bn No.
Performance fees can only be earned after a high water mark is achieved.
For performance fee eligible funds, performance fees are within the range of 10% to 20%.
2 Mans maximum exposure to loss from unconsolidated structured entities at 31 December 2014 is the sum total of any investment held, fees receivable and loans to the fundentities.
Included within fund of funds is a $19 million interest representing approximately 46% in the most subordinated debt tranche of a collateralised loan obligation.
Man is also the Collateral Manager.
Man has limited decision making power and therefore ability to affect returns due to restrictive parameters within the indenture, which also provides substantive removal rights on which Man cannot vote, in particular in relation to the key-man clause, meaning in practice that either the holder of the remaining majority subordinated debt tranche or the majority controlling class shareholder can remove Man as Collateral Manager.
Furthermore, the majority controlling class shareholder has demonstrated its power to make changes to the indenture.
Accordingly, having considered all factors and in particular the restrictive indenture and the practical ability of the other parties to remove Man as Collateral Manager, Man considers that it does not control this investment.

Provisions for onerous property lease contracts represent the present value of the future lease payments that the Group is presently obliged to make under non-cancellable onerous operating lease contracts, less the future benefit expected to be generated from these, including sub-lease revenue where applicable.
The unexpired terms of the onerous leases range from one to 21 years.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the obligation arises, following communication of the formal plan.
Movements in the restructuring provision relate to the settlement of prior year provisions and termination costs associated with acquisitions during the year.
The $6 million reduction in the litigation provision is the result of reassessment of the litigation provision required.
The opening provision balances for 2013 were $29 million for onerous property lease contracts, $30 million in relation to litigation and nil for restructuring.
Investments in associates Associates are entities in which Man holds an interest and over which it has significant influence but not control, and are accounted for using the equity method.
In assessing significant influence Man considers the investment held and its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee through its voting or other rights.
Under the equity method associates are carried at cost plus or minus our share of cumulative post-acquisition movements in undistributed profits orlosses.
Gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interests in these entities.
An impairment assessment of the carrying value of associates is performed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, and any impairment is expensed in the Group income statement.
Mans investments in associates are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2014 Year ended 31 December 2013 Nephila Nephila Capital $m Capital Ltd OFI MGA Total Ltd OFI MGA Total 1 1 % ownership 18.75% 20% 18.75% 20% At beginning of the year 28 3 31 38 38 Additions 2 2 Shares of post-tax profit 9 9 11 1 12 Dividends received 9 1 10 11 11 Disposals 10 10 At year end 28 2 30 28 3 31 Note: 1 18.75% represents Mans ownership of class B common shares.
Mans participation in the profits of Nephila is governed by the share class rights and therefore does not relate proportionately to the ownership interest held.
In 2013 Man reduced its interest in Nephila from 25% to 18.75%, realising a gain on disposal of $10 million which is classified as an adjusting item Note 2.
Man considers that this equity interest, Mans ability to veto Nephilas annual business plan, and the presence of a Man member on the Nephila board of directors provides Man with the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions, and equates to significant influence.

Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life, which for leasehold improvements is over the shorter of the life of the lease and the improvement and for equipment is between three and 10 years.
In 2013 the accelerated depreciation of $43 million relates to the assets no longer being used following the sub-letting of space in Riverbank House our main London headquarters.

Deferred compensation arrangements Man operates cash and equity-settled share-based payment schemes as well as fund product based compensation arrangements.
Details of these schemes can be found in the Directors remuneration report on pages 44 to 64.
For compensation plans whereby deferred compensation is invested in fund products managed by Man, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the fund units is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, with a corresponding liability.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, which is re-measured at each reporting date, and equates to the fair value of theunderlying fund products at settlement date.
During the year, $42 million 2013: $70 million is included in compensation costs relating to share-based payment and deferred fund product plans, consisting of equity-settled share-based payments of $10 million 2013: $35 million, cash-settled share-based payments totalling $1 million 2013:$1million, and deferred fund product plans of $31 million 2013: $34 million.
21.1 Employee Trusts The Employee Trusts have the obligation to deliver shares, options and fund product based payments which have been granted to employees.
Mancontributed funds, in order for the Trusts to meet their current period obligations in the year, of $21 million 2013: $27 million.
The Employee Trusts are fully consolidated into Man and shares held are treated as treasury shares for EPS purposes Note 10.
The shares held by the Employee Trusts are deducted from Tier 1 Capital.
The Employee Trusts are controlled by independent trustees and their assets are held separately from those of Man.
At 31 December 2014 the net assets of the Employee Trusts amounted to $35 million 2013: $36 million.

21.2 Share-based payments In respect of equity-settled share-based payment schemes, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the share awards andoptions granted is recognised as an expense, with the corresponding credit being recognised in equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards and options at grant date.
The fair value of the share awards and options granted in exchange for employee services is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model that takes into account the effect of both financial and demographic assumptions.
Forfeiture and early vesting are based on historical observable data.
Changes to the original estimates, ifany, areincluded in the Group income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Share options The fair values of share options granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: Sharesave share option schemes Grant dates 12 09 2014 Weighted average share price at grant date $ 1.2 1.9 Weighted average exercise price at grant date $ 0.9 1.5 Share options granted in the period 2,302,961 Vesting period years 35 Expected share price volatility % 45 Dividend yield % 6 Risk-free rate % 1.3 Expected option life years 3.2 Number of options assumed to vest 1,754,558 Average fair value per option granted $ 0.6 The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility over the past 10 years.
The expected option life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon US and UK where appropriate government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
There were no share options granted for the key executive option plan, executive share option scheme or deferred bonus share option scheme during the year ended 31 December 2014.

Capital management Investor confidence is an important element in the sustainability of our business.
That confidence comes, in part, from the strength of our capital base.
Man has maintained significant surplus capital and available liquidity throughout the recent periods of market volatility.
This capital has given Man flexibility to support our investors, intermediaries and financial partners and to allow them to make informed decisions regarding their investment exposures.
This confidence gives our business credibility and sustainability.
We have a conservative capital and liquidity framework which allows us to invest in the growth of our business.
We utilise capital to support the operation of the investment management process and the launch of new fund products.
We view this as a competitive advantage which allows ustodirectly align our interests with those of investors and intermediaries.
Man monitors its capital requirements through continuous review of its regulatory and economic capital, including monthly reporting to the Risk and Finance Committee and the Board.
Mans dividend policy is that we will pay out at least 100% of adjusted net management fee earnings per share in each financial year by way of ordinary dividend.
In addition, Man expects to generate significant surplus capital over time, primarily from net performance fee earnings.
Available surpluses, after taking into account our required capital including accruals for future earn-out payments, potential strategic opportunities and a prudent buffer, will be distributed to shareholders over time, by way of higher dividend payments and or share repurchases.
Whilst the Board considers dividends asthe primary method of returning capital to shareholders, it will continue to execute share repurchases when advantageous.
Share capital and capital reserves Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity asadeduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Own shares held through the Employee Trusts are recorded at cost, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of tax, and are deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are transferred to employees or sold.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.

Pension benefits Man operates 12 2013: 12 defined contribution plans and two 2013: two funded defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans Man pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Man has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid.
Defined contribution pension costs totalled $8 million for the year to 31 December 2014 2013: $8 million.
The contributions are recognised as pension costs when they are due.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan creates a financial obligation to provide funding to the pension plan to provide a retired employee with pension benefits usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
As with the vast majority of similar arrangements, Man ultimately underwrites the risks related to the defined benefit plans.
These risks include investment risks and demographic risks, such as members living longer than expected.
The two defined benefit plans operated are the Man Group plc Pension Fund in the UK the UK Plan and the Man Group Pension Plan in Switzerland theSwiss Plan.
At 31 December 2014, the UK plan comprised 91% 31 December 2013: 89% of the Groups total defined benefit pension obligations.
The UK Plan is approved by HMRC for tax purposes, and is operated separately from Man and managed by an independent set of trustees.
Thetrustees are responsible for payment of the benefits and management of the UK Plans assets.
Under UK regulations, Man and the trustees oftheUK Plan are required to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule for the UK Plan.
In order to maintain flexibility with regards to the funding of the UK Plan, Man set up the Man Group Reservoir Trust the Reservoir Trust in 2010.
Man contributed $76 million 50 million of assets to the Reservoir Trust on 31 March 2010 and has committed to ensure the Reservoir Trust value remains at least 69 million from 1 April 2013 or at the level of the funding deficit in the UK Plan, if lower.
The Reservoir Trust gives the pension trustees comfort that Man can fund a deficit at 31 December 2017 and in the event that the UK Plan is fully funded, allows Man to recover the assets so that the UK Plan is not over funded.
The latest funding valuation of the UK Plan was carried out by independent qualified actuaries as at 31 December 2011 and indicated a deficit of 45million, after including 49 million of assets in the Reservoir Trust.
During 2015 a funding valuation of the UK plan as at 31 December 2014 will be carrried out.
To remove the funding deficit, Man agreed to make three cash payments of 11.8 million at 31 March 2013, 2014 and 2016, with a further lump sum to be contributed from the Reservoir Trust in March 2018 of up to 69.0 million to cover any remaining funding deficit.
Cash contributions of 11.8 million were made to the UK Plan in the year to 31 December 2014.
The Group disinvested 16.1m from the Reservoir Trust during 2014 because of the improvement in the funding position at 31 December 2013.
If the contributions currently agreed are insufficient to pay the benefits due, Man will need to make further contributions.
The Group has concluded that it has no requirement to adjust the balance sheet to recognise either a current surplus or a minimum funding requirement on the basis that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of a current or projected future surplus at some point in the future forthe UK Plan, and that the Employer Contribution Reserve is greater than the measured surplus in the Swiss Plan.
The UK plan was closed to new members in May 1999, and to future accrual in May 2011.
Employed members of the UK plan retain enhanced benefits, including a link to salary, on their accrued benefits in the UK plan.
Future benefits are provided via a defined contribution plan.
In Switzerland, the Group operates a retirement foundation with assets which are held separately from the Group.
This foundation covers the majority of employees in Switzerland and provides benefits on a cash balance basis.
From 1 January 2014 the financing vehicle was changed, and from this date the assets and liabilities were transferred to a multi-employer vehicle called Vita Invest, with the assets and liabilities segregated from those of theother employers.
A number of other changes were made to the structure of benefits, resulting in a past service credit recognised in 2013.
Each employee has a retirement account to which the employee and the Group make contributions at rates set out in the plan rules based on a percentage of salary.
Every year the pension fund commission composed of employer and employee representatives decides the level of interest, ifany, to apply to retirement accounts based on their agreed policy.
At retirement an employee can take their retirement account as a lump sum orhave this paid as a pension.

The duration of the UK plan is approximately 17 years, and the duration of the Swiss plan is approximately 22 years.
The assets held by the two plans as at 31 December 2014 are as follows: UK plan Swiss plan $m % $m % UK equities 19 4 Non-UK equities 19 4 Swiss equities 6 13 Non-Swiss equities 7 16 Index linked government bonds 38 9 Corporate bonds 77 18 Swiss bonds 8 18 Non-Swiss bonds 11 25 Property 6 14 Hedge funds 2 5 LDI 56 13 Diversified growth funds 101 23 Cash 37 8 2 4 Other 2 5 Reservoir Trust holdings: Convertible bond type hedge funds 35 8 Growth type hedge funds 57 13 Cash Total assets 439 100 44 100 The plans do not invest directly in property occupied by Man or in Mans own transferable financial securities.
The UK Plans investment strategy is broadly split into growth and matching portfolios.
The matching portfolio is invested primarily in government and corporate bonds, and liability driven investment LDI funds.
These were intended to partially match the movement in the UK Plans funding liabilities, and therefore remove some interest and inflation rate risk.
As the Swiss Plan is essentially a defined contribution plan with guarantees, the assets held aim to be at least as much as the total of the member account balances at any point in time.
Member account balances cannot reduce, but interest is only applied to the account balances when sufficient surplus assets are available.
As such there is no specific asset liability matching strategy in place, but if the liabilities i. e. the sum of the member account balances ever exceed the value of the assets, the Company will consider how to remove a deficit as quickly as possible.

Segmental analysis The criteria for identifying an operating segment is that it is a component of Man whose results are regularly reviewed by the Board and the Executive Committee to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Management information regarding revenues, gross management fee margins, investment performance and distribution costs relevant to the operation of the investment managers, products and the investor base are reviewed by the Board and the Executive Committee.
A centralised shared infrastructure for operations, product structuring, distribution and support functions means that operating costs are not allocated to constituent parts of the investment management businesses.
As a result, performance is assessed, resources are allocated and other strategic and financial management decisions are determined bythe Board and the Executive Committee on the basis of the investment management business of Man as a whole.
Accordingly we operate and report as a single segment investment management business, together with relevant information regarding FUM flows, gross margins, anddistributioncosts to allow for the analysis of the direct contribution of products and the respective investor base.

MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 109 27.
Fair value of financial assets liabilities Man discloses the fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities using three levels, as follows: Level 1.
Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities can be analysed as follows: 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 $m Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets held at fair value: Investments in fund products and other investments Note 15 4 167 42 213 5 102 67 174 Derivative financial instruments Note 16 3 3 20 20 4 170 42 216 5 122 67 194 Financial liabilities held at fair value: Derivative financial instruments Note 17 15 15 1 1 Contingent consideration Note 17 145 145 44 44 15 145 160 1 44 45 During the year, there were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances that affected the fair value of Mans financial assets and no significant transfers of financial assets or liabilities held at fair value between categories.
For investments in fund products, Level 2 investments comprise holdings primarily in unlisted, open-ended, active and liquid funds, such as seeding investments, which have weekly or daily pricing derived from third party information.
A transfer into Level 3 would be deemed to occur where the level of prolonged activity, as evidenced by subscriptions and redemptions, is deemed insufficient to support a Level 2 classification.
This, as well as other factors such as a deterioration of liquidity in the underlying investments, would result in a Level 3 classification.
The material holdings within this category are priced on a recurring basis based on information supplied by third parties without adjustment.
Liquidity premium adjustments of $2 million 2013: $6 million have been applied to gated, suspended, side-pocketed orotherwise illiquid Level 3 investments.
The range of liquidity premium adjustments is from 12% to 33% based on the expected timeframe for exit.
Alarger liquidity adjustment is applied where the exit is further in the future.
Reasonable changes in the liquidity premium assumptions would not havea significant impact on the fair value.
The fair value of non-current assets and liabilities held for sale Note 15.3 are equal to the carrying values of $186 million 2013: $56 million and$33million respectively 2013: $6 million, and would be classified within Level 2.

Fair value of financial assets liabilities continued The basis of measuring the fair value of Level 3 investments is outlined in Note 15.2.

Details of the Numeric and Pine Grove arrangements are detailed in Note 12.
For FRM Holdings Limited the contingent consideration is based on the expected run rate management fees for the legacy FRM business relating to legacy FRM FUM only up to three years after the original acquisition date of July 2012.
The fair values are based on discounted cash flow calculations, which represent the expected future profits of each business as per the earn-out arrangements.
The fair values are determined using a combination of inputs, such as weighted average cost of capital, high water mark levels, net management fee margins, performance, operating margins and the growth in FUM, as applicable.
The discount rates applied are 11% for management fees and 17% for performance fees.
The most significant inputs into the valuations are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2014 Numeric Pine Grove FRM Weighted average net management fee margin 0.4% 1.0% 0.8% Compound growth in average FUM 11% 0% 6% MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 111 27.

Financial guarantees and commitments 29.1 Committed purchase agreements CPAs For certain structured products, Man has previously made commitments to buy underlying investments in specific fund products at a discount to netasset value, if requested by the fund board directors, to create liquidity.
Man has the option to defer a purchase, if so called, for three months.
Thecommitment at 31 December 2014 covers investments in existing fund products totalling $34 million 2013: $37 million.
Given the risk and liquidity management at the portfolio level by the investment manager the residual liquidity and market risk to Man from CPAs is not significant.
The stressed liquidity and risk modelling performed across all structured products includes the CPAs and is provided for in our liquidity and risk management framework.
29.2 Guarantee to funds in respect of Lehman claims As a result of the disposal of the Lehman claims to Hutchinson Investors LLC, Man has provided a continuing guarantee to certain GLG funds for the obligations of Hutchinson Investors LLC in respect of amounts it would owe to funds, up to a maximum of $75 million.
The fair value of this commitment has been determined to be nil 2013: nil.
29.3 Daylight settlement facilities Man from time to time provides a guarantee over certain bank accounts of structured product entities to secure daylight settlement facilities which allow for the efficient movement of cash during the trading day.
In aggregate these guarantees had a notional amount of $50 million 2013: $50 million.
Ordinarily no net exposure exists at the end of any given day and the fair value of these commitments has been determined to be nil 2013: nil.
29.4 Intra-day and overnight credit facilities Man guarantees the obligations under a $500 million intra-day 2013: $500 million and $25 million overnight credit facilities 2013: $25 million, used to settle the majority of the Groups banking arrangements.

Post balance sheet events On 20 January 2014 the Board completed the acquisition of Silvermine Capital Management LLC Silvermine, with an estimated acquisition fair value of approximately $45 million.
Silvermine is a Connecticut-based leveraged loan manager with $3.8 billion of funds under management across nine active collateralised loan obligation structures.
The estimated acquisition fair value primarily relates to acquired intangible assets which attract tax deductions in the US.
The acquisition consideration is structured to align Silvermines interests with those of Man, and comprises an upfront payment of $23.5 million and two earn-out payments.
The earn-out payments are payable following the first up to $16.5 million and fifth up to $30million anniversary of closing on a sliding scale dependent on levels of run rate management fees.
Other matters Man Group is subject to various other claims, assessments, regulatory enquiries and investigations in the normal course of its business.
The directors do not expect these enquiries to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
