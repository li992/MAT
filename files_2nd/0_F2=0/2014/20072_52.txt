LOM Life of Mine years is based on scheduled Probable Reserves including Indicated and some Inferred Resources considered for Life of Mine planning.
Reported Diamond Reserves Resources are based on a Bottom Cut Off BCO which refers to the bottom screen size aperture and varies between 0.80mm and 3.00mm nominal square mesh.
Unless stated otherwise tonnage is quoted as dry metric tonnes.
Estimates of Diamond Reserve tonnes reflect the tonnage to be treated.
Recovered Grade is quoted as carats per hundred metric tonnes cpht.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Diamond Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Diamond Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
194 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES DIAMONDS estimates as at 31 December 2014 EXPLANATORY NOTES Snap Lake: The decrease in Diamond Reserve estimates is primarily due to production and a revision of the Diamond Resource estimates.
Indicated Resource estimates are continuously generated from information gained from underground footwall drilling ahead of the mining face, resulting in a rolling Probable Reserve.
Longer-term Diamond Reserve development is considered impractical due to technical and cost considerations.
Estimates are based on both micro-diamonds and macro-diamonds.
Victor: The decrease is primarily due to production.
The Stockpile Probable Reserves at a 1.50mm BCO of 0.03 M 0.25 Mt at 13.5 cpht are excluded from the table.
The inclusive Stockpile Resource estimates including run of mine at a 1.50 mm BCO of 0.03 M 0.24 Mt at 13.9 cpht Indicated and 0.01 M 0.04 Mt at 30.8cpht Inferred Resource are excluded from the table.
The geographically separate Tango Extension Inferred Resource estimates of 4.3 M 22.0 Mt at 19.6 cpht, BCO 1.50mm areno longer reported as part of the Victor resource.
The increase in Tango Extension is due to the inclusion of two additional geological units.
Gahcho Ku: The increase in saleable carats is due to the addition of Indicated Resources in the 5034 NE Pipe in combination with a revision of the LOM Plan.
Theestimates for 5034 NE and Tuzo are based on both micro-diamonds and macro-diamonds.
During 2014 the Land Use Permit and Water Licence were issued.
The project has been approved for implementation by Anglo American.
The project is expected to treat approximately 35 Mt of ore containing an estimated 54 M 100% basis.
Scheduled Inferred Resources 1.2 Mt constitute 2.6% 1.4 M of the estimated carats.
The estimates are scheduled tonnes and carats as per the 2014 Life of Mine Plan.

The current Mining Right expires in 2038: Venetia Mine will apply to extend the Mining Right at the appropriate time in the future.
Venetia OP : The Life of Mine plan includes the K01, K02 and K03 pipes.
The K01 estimates are based on both micro-diamonds and macro-diamonds.
The planned production for 2015 includes a significant portion of Inferred Resources.
The inclusive Old Recovery Tailings Resource estimates at a 0.80 mm BCO of 1.8M 0.05 Mt at 3804.4 cpht Inferred Resource are excluded from the table.
Venetia UG : The Diamond Reserves increased due to an updated underground mine plan.
The project is expected to treat approximately 133 Mt of ore containing an estimated 94 M. Scheduled Inferred Resources 37.7 Mt constitute 24% 22.2 M of the estimated carats.
Namaqualand: The sale of Namaqualand Mines excluding the Buffels Marine mining right to Emerald Panther Investments PTY Limited was concluded in 2014.
The remaining Diamond Resource estimates reflects the tonnes and carats associated with the Buffels Marine mining right.
Voorspoed: The change is due to production and refinement of the geological model.
Indicated Resources are reported to a depth of 200mbgl.
This has allowed for Probable Reserve estimates to be reported.
Kimberley Mines: The decrease in the Diamond Resource estimates is due to production and model refinement.
Kimberley Mines Central Treatment Plant CTP was initially established to treat ore from both Tailings Resources and underground mines.
Subsequent to the conclusion of the sale of the underground operations to Petra Diamonds in May 2010, only Tailings Resources are being treated.

EXPLANATORY NOTES Damtshaa: The increase in saleable carats is due to the application of revised plant recovery factors.
Higher grade Inferred Resources from the BK 12 Kimberlite are mined for the first three years before including Probable Reserves from BK 9.
The BK 9 and BK 12 inclusive Stockpile Inferred Resource estimates at a 1.65mm BCO of 0.1 M 1.6 Mt at 8.1 cpht are excluded from the table.
Jwaneng Kimberlite: The decrease due to production was largely offset by the increase associated with upgrading of Old Recovery Tailings to Inferred Resource status.
The 2014 Life of Mine Plan includes the Cut 8 estimates of 91 Mt of ore to be treated containing an estimated 110 M North, Centre and South pipes excluding the 4th pipe which is mined as part of waste stripping and stockpiled.
Scheduled Inferred Resources below 401m included in Cut 8 estimates 68.1 Mt constitute 81% 89.3 M of the estimated carats.
The last three years of LOM includes treatment of Kimberlite stockpiles.

DK 1 and DK 2 inclusive Stockpile estimates at a 1.65mm BCO of 0.6 M 3.6 Mt at 17.8 cpht Inferred Resources are excluded from the table.
Letlhakane TMR: The decrease in saleable carats is primarily due to a downward adjustment of the TMR plant recovery factor.
The project is expected to treat approximately 83 Mt of ore containing an estimated 21 M. Scheduled Inferred Resources 48.5 Mt constitute 60% 12.8 M of the estimated carats.
Orapa: A total of 91 M is added to the Diamond Resource estimates by the inclusion of new information resulting in new grade estimates in the South Pipe model.
This is associated with a material increase in the Diamond Reserve.
These increases are partially offset by production.
The Orapa AK1 South Pipe estimates are based on both micro-diamonds and macro-diamonds.
The AK 1 Stockpile estimates at a 1.65mm BCO of 7.7 M 17.4 Mt at 44.1 cpht Inferred Resources are excluded from the table.

Recovered Grade is quoted as carats per hundred metric tonnes cpht or as carats per square meter cpm.
Namdeb Land consists of Elizabeth Bay, Mining Area 1 and Orange River.
Orange River consist of the Auchas, Daberas, Obib and Sendelingsdrif operations.
Namdeb Marine consists of Atlantic 1.
EXPLANATORY NOTES Elizabeth Bay: The decrease in saleable carats is primarily due to production and changes in economic assumptions mainly impacting Inferred Resources.
Mining Area 1: The increase in saleable carats is primarily due to new information in the Ultra Shallow Water A zone 07m at substantially higher grade.
The increased Life of Mine includes a material portion of scheduled tonnes with low geoscientific confidence, planned to be upgraded to Inferred Resources on acontinuous two-year rolling basis.
Incremental Inferred Resource development is dependent on beach accretion for drilling and sampling.
Beach accretion is a process through which an existing beach is built seaward to extend into areas previously under water.
The accretion is accomplished by sand build-up derived from current mining and dredging activities.
The inclusive Overburden Stockpile estimates at a 2.00mm BCO of 34 k 9,227 kt at 0.37 cpht Inferred Resource, the DMS and Recovery Tailings Resource estimates at a 2.00mm BCO of 679 k 52,987 kt at 1.28 cpht Inferred Resource are excluded from the table.
Orange River: The decrease is primarily due to production.
The mining transition from Daberas to Sendelingsdrif will be completed within the next three years.
Atlantic 1: The decrease in reserve carats is primarily due to a planning methodology change.
The Life of Mine remains the same and includes a material portion of Inferred Resources.
Previously all Indicated Resources were used to declare the Diamond Reserve, whereas now only scheduled Indicated Resources in the Life of Mine are converted.
This reduction in Diamond Reserve carats is partially offset by new information allowing conversion of additional Diamond Resources to Diamond Reserves and a faster mining rate which allows a lowering of the cut-off grade.
Due to the high costs associated with resource development, Indicated Resources are converted to Diamond Reserves on an annual basis to ensure scheduled reserves are available two years ahead of current mining.
Bogenfels: The increase in carats is due to application of a different estimation methodology.
Bottom screen cut off details for Inferred Resource estimates are as follows: 1.40 mm BCO: 524 k 7,913 kt at 6.62 cpht.
Midwater: The Midwater Resource comprises the offshore portion of the Diamond Area No.
