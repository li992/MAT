The recoverable amount is the value in use of the cash generating unit unless otherwise stated.
Long-term business Value in use is calculated as an actuarially determined appraisal value, based on the embedded value of the business calculated in accordance with market consistent embedded value MCEV principles, together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
If the embedded value of the business tested is sufficient to demonstrate goodwill recoverability on its own, then it is not necessary to estimate the present value of expected profits from future new business.
If required, the present value of expected profits arising from future new business written over a given period is calculated on an MCEV basis, using profit projections based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management.
These plans reflect managements best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant cash generating unit.
The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, mortality, morbidity and persistency.

Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to management estimates, past experience and relevant available market statistics.
Expected profits from future new business are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.

The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year period.
The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, premium rate and fee income changes, claims inflation and commission rates.
Cash flows beyond that three year period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate.
Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to past experience and relevant available market statistics.
Future profits are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate.

The fair value less costs to sell was determined based on the quoted market value of Avivas share of the subsidiary to which it relates.
Results of impairment testing The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating units including goodwill.
