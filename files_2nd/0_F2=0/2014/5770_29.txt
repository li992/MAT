There has been no change in this information since the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2013.
Significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to both years presented.
i Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
ii Investments shares in Group undertakings Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provisions necessary for impairment.
The fair value of share incentives issued by the Company to employees of subsidiary undertakings is accounted for as a capital contribution and recognised as an increase in the Companys investment in Group undertakings with a corresponding increase in total shareholders funds.
iii Debtors and creditors Debtors are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at this value.
Where the time value of money is material, they are then carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Creditors are initially recognised at fair value.
iv Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply when the timing differences reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
v Own shares Shares in the Company purchased in connection with any share buyback programme, and held as treasury shares, are shown as a deduction from total shareholders funds at cost.
The Group has a number of equity-settled, share-based employee incentive plans and, in connection with these plans, shares in the Company are held by The Experian plc Employee Share Trust and the Experian UK Approved All-Employee Share Plan.
The assets, liabilities and expenses of these separately administered trusts are included in the Companys financial statements as if they were the Companys own.
The assets of the trusts mainly comprise Experian shares and such shares are also shown as a deduction from total shareholders funds at cost.
Contractual obligations to purchase own shares are recognised at the net present value of expected future payments.
Gains and losses in connection with such obligations are recognised in the profit and loss account.
vi Profit and loss account format Income and charges are reported by nature in the profit and loss account, as this reflects the composition of the Companys income and cost base.
Income and costs are recognised on an accruals basis.
