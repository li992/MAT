In addition to the above, the Group has a contingent tax liability representing the difference between the carrying value of trading properties in the statement of financial position and their market value.
This contingent tax, which is not provided in the accounts, amounts to 119.6m 2013: 86.1m.
No benefit has been recognised in respect of deductible temporary differences with a tax value of 1.4m 2013: 1.1m.
It is not possible for the Group to identify the timing of movements in deferred tax between those expected within one year and those expected in greater than one year.
This is because movements in the main balances, both assets and liabilities, will be determined by factors outside the control of the Group, namely the vacation date of properties and interest yield curve movements.
However, given the long-term nature of our property ownership, we anticipate that the balance will predominantly be crystallised in a period greater than one year.

Accordingly, the Groups results for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 22% and should be taxed at 20.5% in the 2015 period.
The change in tax rate has no impact on the income statement in the current year 2013: 0.2m credit.
