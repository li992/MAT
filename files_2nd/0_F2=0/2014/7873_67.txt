99 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 2.3 Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per share EPS is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each share excluding those held in the Employee Benefit Trust or by the Company.
Basic EPS measures are calculated as the Group profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS takes into account the dilutive effect of all outstanding share options priced below the market price, in arriving at the number of shares used in its calculation.
Both of these measures are also presented on an adjusted basis, to remove the effects of exceptional items, being items of both income and expense which are sufficiently large, volatile or one-off in nature to assist the reader of the financial statements to get a better understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
The note below demonstrates how this calculation has been performed.
