Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2014 98 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 29 Retirement benefit assets obligations As at 31 December 2014 the Group operated four employee pension schemes, being two Group personal pension schemes and two defined benefit pension schemes.
Remeasurement gains and losses in the defined benefit schemes are recognised in full as other comprehensive expense income within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
All other pension scheme costs are reported in profit or loss.
Group personal pension schemes The Group makes contributions to the Group personal pension schemes which are open to employees who are not members of the defined benefit schemes.
Dependent upon an employees role and length of service the Group may make contributions to the schemes of up to a maximum of 9% of basic salary.
The Group has no liability beyond these contributions.
Group contributions to these schemes of 1.3m 2013: 1.1m are expensed through the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Persimmon Plc Pension & Life Assurance Scheme The Persimmon Plc Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Persimmon Scheme is a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members in 2001.
Active members of the Persimmon Scheme accrue benefits on a career average related earnings basis.
The assets of the Persimmon Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
On 12 December 2012 Persimmon Plc made a one-off cash contribution of 57.8m to the Persimmon Scheme.
The Persimmon Scheme used these funds to invest in Persimmon Scottish Limited Partnership, which has undertaken to provide fixed cash payments to the Persimmon Scheme to meet its liabilities over a 15 year period.
See note 30 for further details.
Prowting Pension Scheme The Group also operates the Prowting Pension Scheme the Prowting Scheme, a defined benefit scheme.
Active members of the Prowting Scheme accrue benefits on a career average related earnings basis.
The assets of the Prowting Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
Role of Trustees Both the Persimmon Scheme and the Prowting Scheme jointly the Pension Schemes are managed by Trustees who are legally separate from the Company.
The Trustees are composed of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees.
The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for the asset investment policy plus the day to day administration of the benefits.
They are also responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the Pension Schemes see below.
Funding requirements UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently i. e. to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
The last funding valuation of the Persimmon Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 1 January 2011 and as at 31 March 2012 for the Prowting Pension Scheme.
The next funding valuations will be as at 1 January 2014 for the Persimmon Scheme which is in progress and will be as at 31 March 2015 for the Prowting Scheme.
Subsequently valuations will be at intervals of no more than three years thereafter.
Following each valuation, the Trustees and the Company must agree the contributions required if any to ensure the Schemes are fully funded over time on a suitable prudent measure.
Contributions agreed in this manner constitute a minimum funding requirement.
Given the current strength of the Persimmon Schemes funding due to recent cash contributions made to the Persimmon Scheme no deficit contributions are required for that scheme.
However 2.2m p. a. is required for the Prowting Scheme payable to 30 April 2018.
In both cases salary related contributions for active members are also payable.
Under the governing documentation of the Pension Schemes, any future surplus in either scheme would be returnable to the Group by refund, assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the schemes.
As a result the Group does not consider there to be an asset ceiling in respect of the Pension Schemes.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2014 99 29 Retirement benefit assets obligations continued Regulation The UK pensions market is regulated by The Pensions Regulator whose key statutory objectives in relation to UK defined benefit plans are: to protect the benefits of members to promote, and to improve understanding of good administration to reduce the risk of situations arising which may lead to compensation being payable from the Pension Protection Fund PPF The Pensions Regulator has sweeping powers including the powers: to wind up a scheme where winding up is necessary to protect members interests to appoint or remove a trustee to impose a schedule of company contributions or the calculation of the technical provisions where a trustee and company fail to agree on appropriate contributions to impose a contribution where there has been a detrimental action against a scheme Risks associated with the Pension Schemes The Pension Schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are: Risk Description Volatile asset returns The defined benefit obligation DBO is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If assets underperform this discount rate, this will create an element of deficit.
The Pension Schemes hold a significant proportion 54% of assets in growth assets such as equities which, although expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Pension Schemes long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the DBO for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Pension Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the DBO is indexed in line with price inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, this is capped at an annual increase of 5%.
Life expectancy The majority of the Pension Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
There are a number of other risks of running the Pension Schemes including operational risks such as paying out the wrong benefits, legislative risks such as the Government increasing the burden on pension through new legislation and other demographic risks, such as a higher proportion of members having a dependant eligible to receive a survivors pension.
