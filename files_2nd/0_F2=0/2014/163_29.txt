ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 159 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 16.
Financial risk management continued Credit risk arises from loans to two subsidiaries, receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks.
The Companys financial assets are with counterparties whom the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating.
Location of credit risk is determined by physical location of the bank branch, customer or counterparty.
The maximum allowable term of maturity for any individual security is 12 months.
Investment counterparties must have a credit rating of at least Baa2 or better by Moodys Investor Services or BBB by Standard and Poors.
No more than 25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the United States of America, United Kingdom and Barbados, or in any one industry group.
Investments are held mainly in United States dollars and cash and cash equivalents in other foreign currencies are maintained for operational requirements.
Company policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterpartys failure to honour its obligations.
The Companys exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.

The Company does not hold collateral as security for any receivables.
The Company does not grade the credit quality of receivables.
