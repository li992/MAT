Strategic Report Directors Report Accounts Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 73 Notes to the consolidated accounts Significant accounting policies Greggs plc the Company is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Group accounts consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Parent Company accounts present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The accounts were authorised for issue by the Directors on 4 March 2015. a Statement of compliance Both the Parent Company accounts and the Group accounts have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRSs, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
On publishing the Parent Company accounts here together with the Group accounts, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved accounts.
b Basis of preparation The accounts are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand, and are prepared on the historical cost basis except the defined benefit pension asset liability, which is recognised as plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Directors Report and Strategic Report on pages 2 to 63.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Financial Review on pages 20 and 21.
In addition Note 2 to the accounts includes: the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Directors have reviewed the Companys operational and investment plans for the foreseeable future along with the principal risks and uncertainties that could affect these plans or threaten its liquidity.
The key factors likely to affect future performance and the Companys exposure to risks are set out on pages 24 to 26 of the Strategic Report.
In addition the Financial Review on pages 20 and 21 sets out the Companys net cash position and continued strong cash generation.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
The Group chose not to restate business combinations prior to the IFRS transition date 1 January 2004, as no significant acquisitions had taken place during the previous ten years.
The Groups policy up to and including 1997 was to eliminate goodwill arising upon acquisitions against reserves.
Under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3, such goodwill remains eliminated against reserves.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently throughout the Group and to all years presented in these consolidated accounts and are unchanged from previous years with the exception of the adoption of the following relevant standards, amendments and interpretations: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities Transition guidance: Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS 32 Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets Amendments to IAS 36 The adoption of the above has not had a significant impact on the Groups profit for the year or equity.
The other standards and interpretations that are applicable for the first time in the Groups accounts for the year have no effect on these accounts.
The preparation of financial information in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.
The key estimates and judgements that have the most significant impact on the accounts are as follows: Impairment of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
For example, bakery equipment may be impaired if it is no longer in use and or shop fittings may be impaired if sales in that shop fall.
When a review for impairment is conducted the recoverable amount is estimated based on value in use calculations which include managements estimates of future cash flows generated by the assets and an appropriate discount rate.
Consideration is also given to whether the impairment assessments made in prior years remain appropriate based on the latest expectations in respect of value in use and recoverable value.
Where it is concluded that the impairment has reduced a reversal of the impairment is recorded.
The sensitivities for growth rate, discount rate and lease term have been considered and are deemed not significant.
For instance, a 2 per cent change in the growth rate would result in a 50,000 change in the impairment charge.
74 Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued Significant accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions have been estimated for onerous leases and dilapidations.
These provisions represent the best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date, the actual liability being dependent on future events such as trading conditions at a particular shop or the ability of the Group to exit from the lease commitment.
Expectations will be revised each period until the actual liability arises, with any difference accounted for in the period in which the revision is made.
Post retirement benefits The determination of the defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme depends on the selection of certain assumptions including the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality rates.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future years.
The key assumptions made for 2014 are given in Note 21. c Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of Greggs plc and its subsidiary undertakings for the 53 weeks ended 3 January 2015.
The comparative period is the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2013. i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated accounts.
d Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as items of income and expenditure which are material and unusual in nature and which are considered to be of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement.
e Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
f Intangible assets The Groups only intangible assets relate to software and the costs of its implementation which is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are five years.
Assets in the course of development are re-categorised and amortisation commences when the assets are available for use.
g Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy k. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
ii Subsequent costs The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group, and its costs can be measured reliably.
The carrying value of the replaced component is derecognised.
The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Strategic Report Directors Report Accounts Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 75 iii Depreciation Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost less residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment during its expected useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 40 years Short leasehold properties 10 years or length of lease if shorter Plant, machinery, equipment, vehicles, fixtures and fittings 3 to 10 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values if not insignificant are reassessed annually.
iv Assets in the course of construction These assets are re-categorised and depreciation commences when the assets are available for use.
h Investments Non-current investments comprise investments in subsidiaries which are carried at cost less impairment.
Current investments comprise fixed-term fixed-rate bank deposits where the term is greater than three months.
i Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and direct production labour costs.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
k Impairment The carrying amounts of the Group and Companys assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
Impairment reviews are carried out on an individual shop basis unless there are a number of shops in the same location, in which case the impairment review is based on the location.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in prior years are assessed at each reporting date and reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
l Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets are remeasured in accordance with the Group and Companys accounting policies.
Thereafter generally the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
Once classified as held for sale assets are no longer depreciated or amortised.
m Share capital i Re-purchase of share capital When share capital recognised as equity is re-purchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Re-purchased shares that are held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
ii Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the year in which they are approved by the shareholders.
n Employee share ownership plan The Group and Parent Company accounts include the assets and related liabilities of the Greggs Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
In both the Group and Parent Company accounts the shares held by the EBT are stated at cost and deducted from total equity.
76 Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued Significant accounting policies continued o Employee benefits i Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be measured reliably.
ii Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement when they are due.
iii Defined benefit plans The Companys net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price are deducted.
The Company determines the net interest on the net defined benefit asset liability for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit asset liability.
The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA, that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Companys obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.
Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets excluding interest.
The Company recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in the income statement.
When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.
The calculation of the defined benefit obligations is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.
iv Share-based payment transactions The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of share options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date, using an appropriate model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted, and is spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
For options granted before 7 November 2002 the recognition and measurement principles of IFRS 2 have not been applied in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1.
In addition deferred taxation has not been recognised on these options but is accounted for as current tax when it arises.
v Termination benefits Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of the date at which the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of these benefits and the date at which the Group recognises costs for a restructuring.
If benefits are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date they are discounted.
p Provisions A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
i Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
ii Onerous leases Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the lease.
Before a provision is established the Group recognises any impairment loss on the associated assets.
iii Dilapidations Provisions for dilapidations are recognised on a lease-by-lease basis and are based on the Groups best estimate of the likely committed cash outflow.
Strategic Report Directors Report Accounts Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 77 q Revenue i Retail sales Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised as income on receipt of cash or card payment.
Revenue is measured net of discounts, promotions and value added taxation.
ii Franchise sales Franchise sales are recognised when goods are dispatched to franchisees.
Any additional franchise fee income relating to franchise sales is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.
iii Wholesale sales Wholesale sales are recognised when goods are dispatched to customers.
iv Loyalty programme gift cards Amounts received for gift cards or as part of the loyalty programme are deferred.
They are recognised as revenue when the Group has fulfilled its obligation to supply products under the terms of the programme or when it is no longer probable that these amounts will be redeemed.
No adjustment is made to revenue to reflect the fair value of the free items provided under the loyalty scheme as these would be immaterial to the accounts.
The costs of these free items are expensed as the products are provided to the customer.
r Government grants Government grants are recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is a reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them.
Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are incurred.
Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in the income statement over the useful life of the asset.
s Operating lease payments Payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term of the lease.
t Finance income and expense Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method.
u Income tax Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related deferred tax benefit will be realised.
v Research and development The Company continuously strives to improve its products and processes through technical and other innovation.
Such expenditure is typically expensed to the income statement as the related intellectual property is not capable of being formalised and does not always have distinguishable research and development phases.
w IFRSs available for early adoption not yet applied The following standards and amendments to standards which will be relevant to the Group, were available for early adoption but have not been applied in these accounts: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions Amendments to IAS 19 for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2014 endorsed for 1 February 2015 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2014 endorsed for 1 February 2015 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2014 endorsed for 1 January 2015 These standards and amendments will be adopted as they become effective and none of them is expected to have a significant impact on the accounts.

Segmental analysis The Board is considered to be the chief operating decision maker of the Group in the context of the IFRS 8 definition.
The information which is reviewed by the Board for the purposes of assessing financial performance and allocating resources comprises the income statement for the Company as a whole.
The Group has identified one operating segment food-on-the-go retailing which includes the sale of products through our own shops and franchised operations.
The Group conducts a small amount of wholesale business but this is not significant in the context of IFRS 8 and it is not anticipated that this will become a Reportable Segment.
Products and services the Group sells a consistent range of fresh bakery goods, sandwiches and drinks in its shops.
The Group also provides frozen bakery products to its wholesale customers.
Major customers the majority of sales are made to the general public on a cash basis.
A small proportion of sales are made on credit to certain organisations, including wholesale customers, but these are immaterial in a Group context.
Geographical areas all results arise in the UK.
The Board has carefully considered the requirements of IFRS 8 and concluded that, as there is only one reportable segment whose revenue, profits, assets and liabilities are measured and reported on a consistent basis with the Group accounts, no additional numerical disclosures are necessary.
Financial risk management Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Retail sales represent a large proportion of the Groups sales and present no credit risk as they are made for cash or card payments.
The Group does offer credit terms on sales to its wholesale and franchise customers.
In such cases the Group operates effective credit control procedures in order to minimise exposure to overdue debts.
Counterparty risk is also considered low.
All of the Groups surplus cash is held with highly-rated banks, in line with Group policy.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group operates with net current liabilities and is therefore reliant on the continued strong performance of the retail portfolio to meet its short-term liabilities.
This is a well established and proven business model.
Any increase in short-term liquidity risk can be mitigated by reducing capital expenditure.
The Group had significant cash resources at the year end.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
Market risk is not significant and therefore sensitivity analysis would not be meaningful.
Currency risk The Group has no regular transactions in foreign currency although there are occasional purchases, mainly of capital items, denominated in foreign currency.
Whilst certain costs such as electricity and wheat can be influenced by movements in the US dollar, actual contracts are priced in sterling.
In respect of those key costs which are volatile, such as electricity and flour, the price may be fixed for a period of time in line with Group policy.
All such contracts are for the Groups own expected usage.
Interest rate The Group has low exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest only arises on its bank deposits and overdrafts and the defined pension scheme liability.
Net financial income in the year was 175,000 2013: expense of 206,000.
Equity prices The Group has no equity investments other than its subsidiaries.
As disclosed in Note 21 the Groups defined benefit pension scheme has investments in equity-related funds.
Strategic Report Directors Report Accounts Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 79 Capital management The Board defines capital as the equity of the Group.
The Group has remained net cash positive with funding requirements met by cash generated from retail operations.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to enable successful future development of the business.
The Boards policy on dividend levels is to pursue a progressive dividend policy that pays due regard to the growth of earnings per share over the medium term, the cash generative nature of our business and our continuing determination to deliver value to our shareholders.
The Board will continue to consider purchasing its own shares in the market dependent on market prices and surplus cash levels.
The trustees of the Greggs Employee Benefit Trust also purchase shares for future satisfaction of employee share options.
Financial instruments Group and Parent Company All of the Groups surplus cash is invested as cash placed on deposit or fixed-term deposits.
The Groups treasury policy has as its principal objective the achievement of the maximum rate of return on cash balances whilst maintaining an acceptable level of risk.
Other than mentioned below there are no financial instruments, derivatives or commodity contracts used.
Financial assets and liabilities The Groups main financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents and fixed-term deposits.
Other financial assets include trade receivables arising from the Groups activities.
Other than trade and other payables, the Group had no financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 as at 3 January 2015 2013: nil.
Fair values The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying values.
Financial assets and liabilities comprise principally of trade receivables and trade payables and the only interest bearing balances are the bank deposits and borrowings which attract interest at variable rate.
Interest rate, credit and foreign currency risk The Group has not entered into any hedging transactions during the year and considers interest rate, credit and foreign currency risks not to be significant.

Shop impairment and onerous leases The charges arose from the decision to focus on reshaping the Groups existing estate through closure and resite of shops and withdrawal from the Greggs moment brand.
Restructuring of support functions The charge relates to the redundancy costs incurred in respect of restructuring within the support functions.

For shop assets a discounted cashflow is calculated for each shop using historic cashflows including attributable overheads, a zero per cent growth rate, the Groups cost of capital of 10 per cent and an appropriate assumption regarding the remaining lease term.
The net book value of the relevant assets attributable to the shop is impaired to the extent that the net present value of the cashflows is lower than the net book value.
Supply chain assets are impaired to their estimated net realisable value.
Included within disposals for the year were fixtures and fittings with a net book value of 849,000 which related to the closure of the in-store bakeries.

Employee benefits Defined benefit plan Scheme background The Company sponsors a funded defined benefit pension plan the scheme for qualifying employees.
The scheme was closed to future accrual in 2008 and all remaining employees who are still members of the scheme are now members of the Companys defined contribution scheme.
The scheme is administered by a separate Board of Trustees which is legally separate from the Company.
The Trustees are composed of representatives of both the employer and employees.
The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day-to-day administration of the benefits.
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently.
The last funding valuation of the scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 6 April 2011 and showed a surplus.
The Company is currently not required to pay contributions into the scheme.
The funding valuation to 6 April 2014 is currently being finalised and is expected to continue to show a surplus position.
Profile of the scheme The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for former employees and current pensioners.
Broadly, 60 per cent of the liabilities are attributable to former employees and 40 per cent to current pensioners.
The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted average time until benefit payments are made.
For the scheme as a whole, the duration is approximately 20 years.
Investment strategy The Company and Trustees have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate.
This includes a policy to hold sufficient cash and bond assets to cover the anticipated benefit payments for at least the next five years so as to improve the cashflow matching of the schemes assets and liabilities.

Included within the provision is 733,000 in respect of possible recourse on leases which have been conditionally assigned.
The provision for onerous leases is held in respect of leasehold properties for which the Group is liable to fulfil rent and other property commitments for shops from which either the Group no longer trades or for which future trading cash flows are projected to be insufficient to cover these costs.
Amounts have been provided for the shortfall between projected cashflows and property costs up to the lease expiry date or other appropriate estimated date.
The majority of this provision is expected to be utilised within four years such that the impact of discounting would not be material.
The Group provides for property dilapidations, where appropriate, based on estimated costs of the dilapidation repairs.
2,078,000 of the additional provision made in the year in respect of dilapidations was exceptional and relates to the dilapidation costs arising from the removal of in-store bakeries from shops as described in Note 4.
982,000 of this is expected to be utilised after more than one year.
The remainder of the dilapidations provision is expected to be utilised within one year.

The leases typically run for a period of ten years, with an option to renew the lease after that date.
Lease payments are generally increased every five years to reflect market rentals.
For a small number of the leases the rental is contingent on the level of turnover achieved in the relevant unit and these amounts are immaterial.
The inception of the shop leases has taken place over a long period of time and many date back a significant number of years.
They are combined leases of land and buildings.
It is not possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the split of the fair values of the lease interest between land and buildings at inception.
Therefore, in determining lease classification, the Group evaluated whether both parts are clearly an operating lease or a finance lease.
Firstly, title does not pass for the land or building.
Secondly, because the rent paid to the landlord for the buildings is increased to market rent at regular intervals, and the Group does not participate in the residual value of the land or building it is judged that substantially all the risks and rewards of the land and building are with the landlord.
Based on these qualitative factors it is concluded that the leases are operating leases.
