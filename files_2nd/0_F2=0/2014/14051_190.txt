Share-based Payment Expense The Group recognised the following expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions: 2014 2013 m m Long Term Incentive Scheme and Plan 0.1 0.1 Performance Share Plan 5.5 1.5 Deferred Bonus Plan 0.9 Sharesave 2012 0.2 2.2 5.4 2.9 Executive Option Plan EOP Options granted under the EOP may be exercised after the third anniversary of grant, dependent upon the achievement of a financial performance target over three years.
The options are granted at market value and awards made to eligible employees are based on between 50% and 100% of salary as at 31 December prior to grant.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options may be forfeited if the eligible employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Details of the movement in all EOP options are as follows: Weighted average Weighted average Number of options exercise price Number of options exercise price 2014 2014 2013 2013 Thousands Thousands Outstanding at 1 January 1,469 3.24 2,472 2.56 Granted during the year Exercised during the year 536 2.81 797 1.58 Lapsed during the year 597 3.11 206 1.53 Outstanding at 31 December 336 4.16 1,469 3.24 Of these options 335,886 2013: 1,468,534 were exercisable at the end of the year, with a weighted average exercise price of 4.16 2013:3.24.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2014 had a weighted average contractual life of 2.7 years 2013: 2.0 years.
The exercise prices for options outstanding at 31 December 2014 ranged from 3.39 to 4.55 2013: 2.17 to 4.55.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise approximates to the weighted average share price during the year, which was 3.45 2013: 5.73.
The fair value of options granted under the EOP is measured by use of the Binomial Lattice model.
The Binomial Lattice model is considered to be most appropriate for valuing options granted under this scheme as it allows exercise over a longer period of time between the vesting date and the expiry date.
There were no new options granted under Executive Option Plan during the year.
Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards made to eligible employees under the above schemes are structured as options with a zero exercise price.
The extent to which an award vests and therefore becomes exercisable is measured by reference to the growth in the Groups earnings per share EPS or total shareholder return TSR over the performance period or service period conditions.
Details of the movement in all LTIS and LTIP options are as follows: Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average options exercise price options exercise price 2014 2014 2013 2013 Thousands Thousands Outstanding at 1 January 488 Nil 917 Nil Granted during the year 62 Nil Exercised during the year 212 Nil 332 Nil Lapsed during the year 159 Nil Outstanding at 31 December 276 Nil 488 Nil Of these options, 275,831 2013: 425,953 were exercisable at the end of the year.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2014 had a weighted average contractual life of 2.30 years 2013: 2.38 years.
There were no new options granted under either LTIS or LTIP during the year.

Share-based Payment Expense continued Transformational Share Scheme Awards made to eligible employees under the Transformational Share Scheme are structured as options with a nil exercise price and are exercisable after the third anniversary of the grant.
The employee must exercise the options no later than 30 days after the vesting date.
Furthermore, if the eligible employee leaves the Group before the options vest, the options may be forfeited.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2014 had a weighted average contractual life of 0 year 2013: 0 year.
The Group has no plan to use the Transformational Share Scheme in the future.
Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP, eligible employees have been granted options with an exercise price of two pence.
Awards vest after the performance period of three to five years and are subject to the achievement of four performance measures with the exception of new non-performance awards granted in 2014.
These non-performance options are only subject to continued employment on vesting dates which vary from six months to three years after the grant dates.
On the performance related awards, the primary performance measure is TSR and the second performance measure is based on EPS growth.
Two additional measures on new grants in 2014 are Absolute Share Price and Strategic Objectives.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2014 had a weighted average contractual life of 8.61 years 2013: 8.37 years.
In the year, twelve grants were made, of which three grants were non-performance buy out awards to the new executives and another four were non-performance restricted share awards to eligible employees.
Total non-performance options account for two third of the total options granted in the year.
The remaining five performance based awards split between the four performance measures with Absolute Share Price and TSR performance conditions each attached to 35.5% of options, another 22.4% subject to EPS growth performance conditions and the remaining 6.6% subject to Strategic Objectives performance conditions.
The options subject to Absolute Share Price and TSR performance conditions were valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation model.
The options subject to EPS growth and Strategic Objectives performance conditions were deemed to have fair values equal to their face value less the present value of any dividend payments not received over the vesting period.
The Monte Carlo Simulation model is considered to be the most appropriate for valuing options granted under schemes where there are changes in performance conditions by which the options are measured, such as for the Absolute Share Price or TSR based awards.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

Share-based Payment Expense continued Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Under the DBP, eligible employees are entitled to use up to 50% of their earned annual bonus to purchase shares in the Group at market price.
Provided they remain in employment for this period, the shares are retained for that period and the two performance measures which are the same as the PSP scheme, being TSR and EPS growth have been met, the Group will make a matching share award.
For shares purchased by employees in 2011, the match was on a basis of two times the gross bonus deferred.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2014 had a weighted average contractual life of 0.7 year 2013: 1.2 years.
There were no new options granted under Deferred Bonus Plan in the year.
Sharesave 2012 The Sharesave 2012 scheme provides for a purchase price equal to the daily average market price on the date of grant less 10%.
The options can be exercised for a period of six months following their vesting.
Details of the movement in Sharesave 2012 options are as follows: Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average options exercise price options exercise price 2014 2014 2013 2013 Thousands Thousands Outstanding at 1 January 5,132 5.14 6,012 5.14 Granted during the year Exercised during the year 1 5.14 23 5.14 Lapsed during the year 2,256 5.14 857 5.14 Outstanding at 31 December 2,875 5.14 5,132 5.14 Of these options, none 2013: none were exercisable at the end of the year.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2014 had a weighted average contractual life of 1.4 years 2013: 2.4 years.
Given that options granted under the Sharesave plan can be exercised at any time after vesting, management consider the Binomial Lattice model to be appropriate to value the options granted under this scheme.
The Binomial Lattice model allows exercise over a window in time, from vesting date to expiry date and assumes option holders make economically rational exercise decisions.
There were no new options granted under Sharesave Plan in the year.
