Hedges The group uses derivatives for the management of fi financial risks relating to its asset and liability portfolios, mainly associated with non-trading interest rate risks and exposures to foreign currency risk.
Most non-trading interest rate risk is transferred from the originating business to the Central Treasury in the Specialist Bank.
Once aggregated and netted Central Treasury, as the sole interface to the wholesale market for cash and derivative transactions, actively manages the liquidity mismatch and non-trading interest rate risk from our asset and liability portfolios.
In this regard, central treasury is required to exercise tight control of funding, liquidity, concentration and non-trading interest rate risk within defi ned parameters.
The accounting treatment of accounting hedges is dependent on the classifi cation between fair value hedges and cash fl ow hedges and in particular accounting hedges require the identifi cation of a direct relationship between a hedged item and hedging instrument.
This relationship is established in limited circumstances based on the manner in which the group manages its risk exposure.
Below is a description of each category of accounting hedges achieved by the group.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges are entered into mainly to hedge the exposure of changes in fair value of fi xed rate fi financial instruments attributable to interest rates.
