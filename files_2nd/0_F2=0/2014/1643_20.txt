Long-term incentives This includes the LTIP awards, granted under the previous Long-Term Incentive Plan, vesting based on performance in the three-year period ending 31 March 2014.
The values included in the single figure table are calculated by multiplying the number of shares granted on 9 July 2011 by the level of vesting 94% of maximum awards and the three-month average share price to 31 March 2014 of 2,094p.
These awards were subject to the delivery of EPS growth.
0% of awards vest for diluted EPS growth of less than RPI plus 5%, with 100% of awards vesting for diluted EPS growth of more than RPI plus 12%.
These targets were both subsequently increased by 1% to 6% and 13% respectively to reflect the effect of the share consolidation completed in July 2013.
Average diluted EPS growth for the three year performance period exceeded RPI by 12.6% per annum and therefore 94% of the award shall vest on 6 July 2014.
The Committee considered this level of vesting in the context of the wider performance of the business and returns to shareholders during the period and considered that it was appropriate.
For 2012 13, 33% of the maximum LTIP awards granted to the Executives in 2010 11 vested.
