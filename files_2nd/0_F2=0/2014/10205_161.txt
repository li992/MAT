In addition there was a hindsight adjustment made in the first 12 months after the completion of the acquisition of the Iona assets of $361,000 relating mostly to the fair value of the acquired deferred income.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to each individual cash generating unit CGU.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the net present value on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
It has been determined that the Group has three CGUs being the three geographical segments North America, International and Asia Pacific and Japan.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of the CGU with their recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
The Group has carried out its annual impairment testing at 30 April each year.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on the value in use VIU calculations.
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the VIU of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The VIU calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
In all cases the approved budget for the following financial year forms the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
The cash flow projections in the three financial years following the budget year reflect managements expectation of the medium and long-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the VIU calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
In determining the key assumptions, management has taken into consideration the current economic climate, the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates, and the pressure this places on impairment calculations.
Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to each CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessment of the time value of money at the consolidated statement of financial position date and risks specific to the CGU.
The discount rate applied to each CGUs operations was: 2014 2013 North America 14.1% 16.4% International 11.4% 13.3% Asia Pacific and Japan 12.8% 14.9% Long-term operating margin The long-term operating margin for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins.
The long-term EBITDA margins applied to each CGU is 44.0% 2013: 42.5%.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows The long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed to be no greater than the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the countries in which the CGU operates and were 2.0% 2013: 2.0%.
The long-term growth rate is applied consistently across all CGUs as: The businesses within the CGUs have similar trading characteristics: Future forecasts are considered to be similar across all CGUs: and Business risks are considered to be the same across all CGUs.
