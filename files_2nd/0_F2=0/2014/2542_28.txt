Accounting policies Investments The company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost less any provisions made for impairment.
In respect of FRS 20 Share-based payment, the company records an increase in its investment in subsidiaries to reflect the share-based compensation expense recorded by its subsidiaries.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method or at fair value.
Finance costs arising from the outstanding loan balance and finance charges are charged to the profit and loss account using an effective interest rate method.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.

Timing differences not recognised include those relating to the revaluation of fixed assets in the absence of a commitment to sell the assets, the gain on sale of assets rolled into replacement assets and the distribution of profits from overseas subsidiaries in the absence of any commitment by the subsidiary to make the distribution.

Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging The company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the profit and loss account.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments is as follows: For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the profit and loss account when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the profit and loss account.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the profit and loss account.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to the profit and loss account.
For fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk shall adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and be recognised in the profit and loss account.
If the hedge relationship was ineffective the hedged item would no longer be adjusted and the fair value gain or loss on the hedging instrument would continue to be recorded in the profit and loss account.
