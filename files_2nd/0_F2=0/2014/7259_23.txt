Categorisation within the fair value hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation inputs that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price, and the fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by comparison between forecast interest rates and the contract rate of interest, as provided by third party bank confirmations.
These contracts are therefore categorised as Level 2.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Groups current dividend policy is to maintain a payout ratio of 3040% of underlying net profit.
In 2014 the Group refinanced its borrowings to take advantage of lower finance costs and reduce total borrowings, thereby lowering the overall cost of capital.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
During 2014, the Groups strategy was to lower the overall gearing ratio by refinancing the debt structure and reducing finance costs.
The gearing ratios at 31 December 2014 and 2013 were as follows: 2014 2013 Note 000 000 Total borrowings 17 215,816 230,566 Less: cash and cash equivalents 14 57,403 80,039 Net debt 158,413 150,527 Total equity 390,462 341,304 Total capital 548,875 491,831 Gearing ratio 29% 31% The decrease in the gearing ratio during 2014 resulted primarily from improved trading results and lower interest costs as a result of the debt refinancing.

Sales between segments are carried out on an arms length basis and it is considered that sale of goods is the only material revenue stream for consideration.
The segment results for the year ended 31 December 2014 are as follows: EMEA Americas Asian Group 000 000 000 000 Total revenue 435,183 160,094 163,956 759,233 Intra-segment revenue 89,293 3,648 9,469 102,410 Total segment revenue 345,890 156,446 154,487 656,823 Inter-segment revenue 32,680 8,194 19,083 59,957 Revenue from external customers 313,210 148,252 135,404 596,866 Underlying operating profit segment result 32,508 18,561 32,595 83,664 A reconciliation of the underlying operating profit to the operating profit as per the income statement is provided below.

Borrowings are secured against the property, plant and equipment of the Group see Note 17.
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired.
Impairment test for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs, identified according to the country of operation and business segment.
A segment level summary of the goodwill allocation at 31 December 2014 is presented below: EMEA Americas Asian Group 000 000 000 000 Goodwill 117,760 5,557 59,872 183,189 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
The calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated in the following table.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business segment in which the CGU operates.
HellermannTyton 72 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 continued 8 Intangible assets continued The key assumptions used for the value in use calculations are as follows: North South EMEA America America Asian HT Data 1 Gross margin 42.5% 38.6% 37.9% 40.3% 31.6% 2 Growth rate 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% 3 Discount rate 10.5% 13.2% 20.2% 12.2% 11.2% 1.
Weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.
Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU within the business segment.
Management determined budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations of market developments.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.
Based on the assessment there is no indication of impairment, and a reasonably possible change in the assumptions applied would not result in any impairment.

As of 31 December 2014, trade receivables of 15,353,000 2013: 11,062,000 were less than three months past due, but not impaired.
These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default.

The full fair value of a derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the item is more than 12 months and, as a current asset or liability, if the maturity of the item is less than 12 months.
Fair value is determined by reference to observable market data.
The total carrying amount of the asset or liability represents the fair value amount the Group would be required to pay receive at the balance sheet date to from the holder of the obligation to close out the contract concerned, and is charged credited to the Group income statement.
a Forward foreign exchange contracts The notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2014 were 16,873,000 31 December 2013: 15,641,000. b Interest rate swaps At 31 December 2014 the Group has in place two interest rate swap agreements, one denominated in Euro with a notional principal amount of 62,414,689 2013: nil and one held in Japanese Yen with a notional principal amount of JPY2,657 million 2013: nil.
The Group also has two interest rate cap agreements, one denominated in USD with a notional principal amount of USD51,960,000, and one denominated in GBP with a notional principal amount of GBP15,590,000.
These agreements were entered into during 2014 and were not in place at 31 December 2013.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps which had been taken out to hedge the currency fluctuations and interest costs associated with the secured notes were redeemed when the secured notes were repaid in March 2014.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2014 were nil 31 December 2013: 220,000,000.

This comprises 215,308,075 issued at the time of the IPO, 80,034 issued for the employee free share scheme in 2013, and 10,000 issued on 7 March 2014 for the employee global share plan.
All issued shares are fully paid by cash consideration and all carry equal voting rights.
Proceeds from the issue of new shares in 2013 were 35,075,000.
The share premium of 33,128,000 is shown net of fees of 1,794,000, with the final net proceeds from the primary issue of shares, after deducting further fees which were charged to the income statement, being 29,479,000.
The preference shares were redeemed by the Company resulting in the creation of the capital redemption reserve, which is non-distributable.
Shares purchased by the Group to fulfil the requirements on the UK Global Share Plan are held as treasury shares.
Other reserves in 2012 comprise capital contributions from the previous shareholders.
The balance in 2013 arises on the Group restructuring and is carried forward in 2014.
In 2014, the movement in the currency translation reserve is predominantly due to the movement in the US Dollar and Chinese Yuan against the Euro and the impact of this on the re-translation of the assets and liabilities on consolidation.

The facility was drawn down in Euros, GBP, USD and JPY into the respective local businesses, and consequently the gross borrowings are retranslated at the closing exchange rates and will not necessarily total 200 million.
Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 1.75% above the applicable LIBOR in the territory where the borrowings are drawn down, for a term of five years.
Transaction costs in relation to the instrument of 3,039,000 have been capitalised and are being amortised as finance costs over five years.
The balance of capitalised transaction costs is shown in the table below: 2014 2013 000 000 Gross bank borrowings 206,172 Capitalised transaction costs 2,647 Net bank borrowings 203,525 As a result of the new arrangements the Group has an undrawn revolving credit facility of 30 million at 31 December 2014 31 December 2013: 80 million.
Secured notes The secured notes were repaid in full on 28 March 2014.
As at 31 December 2013 therefore, the liability recognised in respect of the secured notes included an early repayment fee of 1%.
Interest on the notes was payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 5.125% above EURIBOR.
Cross currency interest rate swaps which had been taken out to hedge the currency fluctuations and interest costs were redeemed at that time.
HellermannTyton 78 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 continued 17 Borrowings continued Other loans Other loans relate to loans against two properties, and are repayable within seven years.
The carrying amounts and fair value of the non-current borrowings are as follows: Carrying amount Fair value 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 Non-current Bank borrowings 203,525 200,459 Secured notes 222,200 222,200 Other loans 7,287 2,586 7,113 2,410 Finance lease obligations 3,930 4,801 4,069 4,614 Total 214,742 229,587 211,641 229,224 The fair values are based on cash flows discounted using a rate based on the average borrowing rate of 2.2% 2013: 5.3%.
The fair value of current borrowings does not differ significantly from their carrying value, as the impact of discounting is not significant.
The carrying amounts of the Groups borrowings are denominated in the following currencies: 2014 2013 Currency 000 000 GBP 19,840 Euro 128,500 228,374 US Dollar 49,060 1,892 Japanese Yen 18,071 Other currencies 345 300 Total 215,816 230,566 Finance lease obligations The Groups finance leases are principally over land and buildings and, to a lesser extent, vehicles and machinery.
The lease liabilities are effectively self-secured as the rights to the leased assets revert to the lessors in the event of default.
In most cases, the Group has an option to purchase at the end of the lease at a pre-determined price.

One-off costs in the year to 31 December 2013 principally represent costs related to facility reorganisation in the USA and termination costs in Europe.
The gain on disposal of asset in the year to 31 December 2014 relates to the sale of a property in the USA.
In the year to 31 December 2013 the gain on disposal of asset relates to the sale of a property in the UK.

The charge is recognised in the income statement within administrative expenses.
The provisions at the end of each year are considered to be current since they relate to ongoing legal claims that could be settled at any time.
In the Directors opinion, after taking legal advice, the outcome of these legal claims will not give rise to any significant loss beyond the amounts provided at 31 December 2014.
Strategic Financial Other HellermannTyton Annual Report and Accounts 2014 report Governance statements information 85 26 Share-based payments At 31 December 2014, the Group had two plans involving share-based payments, which are described below.
The compensation cost recognised in the Groups income statement in relation to share-based payment plans is set out in the table below: Expense recognised for the year 2014 2013 000 000 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan 1,599 1,479 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan 1,343 Global Share Plan free shares 369 165 Global Share Plan matching shares 170 1 3,481 1,645 Movements in the total number of share options outstanding are as follows: Options 2014 2013 000 000 At 1 January 3,868 Granted 2,606 3,868 Forfeited 58 Exercised Expired At 31 December 6,416 3,868 The exercise price for all the share options is zero.
None of the options were exercisable at year end.
Details of the plans are described in more detail below: 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan Share options under the 2014 LTIP were issued to certain senior managers in three phases during the year, with those employees being granted nil-cost share options restricted stock units in the USA dependent on meeting certain performance criteria.
Details of these can be found in the Directors remuneration report on page 43.
These shares vest in three years from the date of grant, and are issued under the same basis as the 2013 LTIP.
Global Share Plan The Global Share Plan GSP offers three ways to provide shares to employees: free shares: shares purchased using contributions from employees: and free matching shares.
The free shares and matching shares are at a cost to the Group, and are described in more detail in the Directors remuneration report on page 36, and in summary below.
Employee free shares Free shares were awarded to the majority of employees in the Group soon after the IPO during 2013, and these shares vest three years from the date of grant.
Matching shares A share matching scheme was established for certain Group employees in December 2013, and was extended further in 2014, with the intention to extend this to the remaining eligible employees in the Group.
For shares purchased by the employee on a monthly basis, the Company will match those shares up to a maximum annual amount.
These shares vest three years from the date of grant.
HellermannTyton 86 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 continued 26 Share-based payments continued Fair value and assumptions The fair value of the awards under the 2014 and 2013 LTIP and the GSP is estimated at the grant date using either a Black-Scholes valuation or a Monte Carlo simulation, depending on the performance conditions that must be met for the award to vest.
For the element of the share options based on earnings per share EPS growth or continuous employment, the Black-Scholes model has been used, and for the element of the share options based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR, a Monte Carlo simulation has been used.
The significant assumptions used in these valuation models for awards issued in 2014 are disclosed below: 2014 LTIP Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Date of grant 1 May 2014 20 May 2014 3 Sep 2014 Number of shares granted 1,100,751 857,524 466,229 Vesting period 3 years 3 years 3 years Dividend yield 2.5% 2.5% 2.5% Fair value per share at grant date pence per share pps 292p 267p 286p Fair value per share with TSR performance condition pps 173p 158p 170p All the share grants have a zero exercise price and have a vesting date of three years from the grant date.
An estimated share price volatility rate of 31% has been used for grants in the period.
This is based on the historic volatility of a comparator group of 20 FTSE 350 All Share companies over three years, as there is no share price history available for the Group before April 2013.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds over three years as determined by the Bank of England, and the rate applied during the year was 1.1% to 1.3% depending on the grant date.
The fair value of the share options for the matching share scheme is estimated as the share price at grant date.
The fair values are calculated in Sterling as the shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange, and translated into Euro at the relevant exchange rates.
27 Retirement benefit obligations Pension benefits The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan in Japan and South Africa based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Plan assets are held in trusts or similar entities governed by local regulatory frameworks and practices, which have no significant impact on the implementation of the schemes.
These schemes cover 230 employees 2013: 231 with the balance of employees in the Group covered by optional defined contribution schemes where available.

For HellermannTyton Japan, the official retirement age is 60.
For employees retiring from HellermannTyton Japan at 60 years of age, there is a choice in respect of their pensions.
They can elect to receive a lump sum payment or choose to have the pension paid to them in instalments spread over five to ten years.
Where employees choose to receive the money in instalments, these are paid quarterly from the pension fund over the specified duration minimum five years, maximum ten years.
As there are no options for pensions to be paid out over more than ten years or conversely paid out over less than four years, except in the case of a lump sum payment, life expectancy is not factored into the calculations.

In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised in the balance sheet.
28 Operating lease commitments The Group leases various office, warehouse and factory space under non-cancellable operating leases.
The lease terms are between three and ten years, and the majority are renewable at the end of the lease at market rates.
The Group also leases various plant and equipment under cancellable operating leases.
