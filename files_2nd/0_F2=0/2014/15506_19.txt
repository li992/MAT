The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2014 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 20 May 2014.
PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As a result of the increasing relative size of the cash-settled share incentive scheme charges it has been decided to separately disclose the amount on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period.
The increase in this charge mainly reflects the strong rise in the Companys share price over the last year and therefore separate disclosure was deemed appropriate in order to provide a clearer understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
In view of the size and nature of the charge as a non-cash item, it has also been decided to separately disclose the amortisation of intangible assets on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period.
More information regarding the intangible asset is set out in note 6 of these financial statements.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Statement of compliance The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
b Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis.
Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described below, the Directors have made judgements, estimations and assumptions regarding the future.
The judgements, estimations, and assumptions that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are detailed below.
Estimates and judgements are evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In future, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
i Trade receivables notes 10 and 11 Trade receivables largely represent customers who have energy debt assigned to a prepayment meter, or are in the process of having such a meter installed.
This requires the Directors to make estimates and judgements as to the expected level of eventual debt recovery from these customers based on historical experience.
ii Revenue recognition and unbilled energy debtors note 11 Accrued revenue includes balances for energy consumption which have yet to be allocated and billed on to individual customers.
In the absence of meter readings, the level of this revenue relies on industry estimates of annual consumption by the Groups customers.
The Directors are required to make estimates and judgements as to the likelihood of this revenue being billed and recovered based on industry information and historical experience.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 83 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED iii Share incentive scheme charges note 18 The Group has a conventional share option scheme and a Joint Share Ownership Plan JSOP for employees and Directors.
The fair value of share options and JSOP awards is estimated by using the Binomial valuation model on the date of grant based on certain assumptions.
Those assumptions are described in note 18 and include, amongst others, the dividend yield, expected volatility, expected life of the options and number of options expected to vest.
iv New energy supply arrangements note 21 The entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013 included the acquisition of two new subsidiaries from Npower.
The Directors were therefore required to make a judgment in relation to the accounting treatment of the transaction under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Further detail regarding the transaction and the associated accounting treatment are set out in note 21 of these financial statements.
By virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from presenting a statement of comprehensive income.
The following standards and interpretations have become mandatory for the Company during the current accounting period, but where relevant to the Company they have not had a material impact on the financial statements: IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements: IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: and IFRS 13 Fair Value measurement.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries The Groups financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Telecom Plus PLC and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
Control is recognised where an investor is expected to receive, or has rights to, variable returns from its investment in the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
ii Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate are not recognised.
84 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED d Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for in accordance with the guidance set out in IFRS 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3.
An analysis of whether any subsidiaries acquired constitute businesses in their own right is initially undertaken with reference to the guidance in IFRS 3.
Where an acquired subsidiary does not constitute a business under IFRS 3 i. e. it does not have, inter alia, the inputs, processes and outputs to function on a standalone basis the acquisition of the subsidiary is treated as an acquisition of assets.
The assets acquired are recorded at cost and no goodwill is recognised.
Transaction costs are capitalised as part of the cost of acquisition.
Where an acquired subsidiary constitutes a business under IFRS 3, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and any impairment is recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
e Revenue Revenue is the value of goods and services supplied to external customers and independent distributors excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes.
For each of the Companys main income streams from the provision of fixed line telephony, broadband, mobile telephony, gas and electricity services, transactions are recorded as sales in the month when the provision of those services or the supply of goods takes place.
The Companys customers are invoiced in the month following that in which the services are provided.
The Company also generates revenue as a result of providing bill payment protection and accidental death cover to customers for a monthly fee.
The Company does not retain the insurance risk for these services.
The recognition of revenue associated with the provision of gas and electricity services to customers by the Group relies on industry estimates of annual usage where meter readings are not available.
These estimates are based on historical usage information as adjusted for known factors such as variations in weather.
f Interest income Interest income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues, using the effective interest rate method.
g Leases Payments on operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
h Hire purchase agreements Hire purchase agreements relate to leases of assets where the Group has passed on substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and are therefore classified as finance leases.
When assets are leased out under finance leases, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable.
i Taxation The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Taxation is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 85 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Deferred tax is recognised, based on the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
j Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less a provision for depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets in equal instalments over their expected useful lives.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided on other assets at the following rates: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and machinery 15 years Fixtures and fittings 7 years Freehold and leasehold improvements 3 years Computer and office equipment 3 to 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
k Intangible assets Intangible assets which arise e. g. on the entering into of significant commercial contractual arrangements are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, or the term of any contractual arrangement or, where appropriate and an indefinite life is chosen, made subject to an annual impairment review.
l Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised and is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
m Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
86 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED n Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are initially stated at cost.
Provision is made for any impairment in the value of these investments.
In the Group accounts investments in associated undertakings are shown at cost plus accumulated profits less any dividends received from the associated undertakings.
o Inventories Inventories principally include mobile telephones and other electronic equipment and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is measured on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
p Financial instruments The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Financial instruments are recognised on the trade date when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of a financial instrument not at fair value through profit and loss, transactions costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial instrument.
Financial instruments are derecognised on the trade date when the Group is no longer a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
q Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the short credit period is not considered to be material.
r Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits with banks and, for the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, revolving credit facilities.
s Borrowings Short and long term borrowings comprise revolving credit facilities and bank loans.
The fees associated with entering into borrowing facilities are capitalised and netted off against borrowings and amortised over the term of the borrowings.
t Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material.
u Share based payments The fair value at the date of grant of share based remuneration, principally share options, is calculated using a binomial pricing model and is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
All share option based remuneration is equity settled, except as set out below.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 87 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED The Company established a Joint Share Ownership Plan the JSOP on 30 March 2011.
On vesting, any gains made on awards granted under the JSOP may be settled either through: i a cash payment to the participant equal to the gain: or ii the transfer of legal and beneficial ownership to the participant of such number of shares as have full value equal to the gain.
JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a binomial pricing model.
The fair value is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
v Segmental reporting Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, Chief Executive Mr Andrew Lindsay, is disclosed in note 1 to the accounts.
w Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
x Pensions The Group makes contributions to certain employees personal pension plans.
These are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they become payable.
y Dividends Final dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
z New standards issued but not yet effective The Group has not adopted any standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation dates.
It is not expected that adoption of the majority of standards or interpretations which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the EU, but have not been adopted, will have a material impact on the financial statements.
88 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SEGMENT REPORTING The Groups reportable segments reflect the two distinct activities around which the Group is organised: Customer Acquisition: and Customer Management.
Customer Acquisition revenues represent joining fees from the Groups distributors, the sale of marketing materials and sales of equipment including mobile phone handsets and wireless internet routers.
Customer Management revenues are principally derived from the supply of fixed telephony, mobile telephony, gas, electricity and internet services to residential and small business customers.
The Board measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and segment result, which is referred to as operating profit.
The Group applies the same significant accounting policies across both operating segments.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS 2014 2013 000 000 Group Cost At 1 April 2,969 2,969 Additions 221,594 - At 31 March 224,563 2,969 Amortisation At 1 April - - Charge for the year 3,785 - At 31 March 3,785 - Carrying amount At 31 March 220,778 2,969 The opening intangible asset of 2,969,000 2013: 2,969,000 was attributable wholly to the Customer Management operating segment and related to the issue of 426,989 shares at nominal value to Npower in two tranches on 19 August 2011 and 9 January 2012 as part of the revisions to the Companys energy supply agreement with Npower entered into on 24 May 2011.
The intangible asset had previously been considered to have an indefinite life as the supply agreement with Npower entered into on 24 May 2011 did not have a finite term.
However, the Company entered into a new energy supply agreement with Npower with effect from 1 December 2013.
As the new supply agreement is in substance considered to be an extension of the supply agreement entered into in May 2011, the opening intangible asset will be recognised on the Companys balance sheet within the cost of investments in subsidiary undertakings see note 8 and continue to be recognised as an intangible asset on the Groups balance sheet.
Given that the new energy supply agreement has a 20 year term, the opening intangible asset is no longer considered to have an indefinite life and will therefore be amortised evenly over the term of the new energy supply agreement in the Group financial statements.
The additions to Group intangible assets during the year relate to the entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower on improved commercial terms through the acquisition by the Company of Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited the Companies from Npower Limited having effect from 1 December 2013 the Transaction.
The total consideration for the Transaction comprised a payment to Npower of 196.5 million on 20 December 2014, a deferred amount of 21.5 million payable on 20 December 2016 and a payment of 2.5 million made in January 2014 for the net assets acquired in the Companies which comprised cash and short term working capital balances.
The addition to intangible assets of 221.6 million therefore represents the total consideration paid and payable to Npower, excluding the payment for net assets acquired in the Companies, plus certain transaction costs of 3.6 million which in accordance with the relevant accounting standards have been recognised as a cost of acquisition.
The intangible asset will be amortised evenly over the 20 year life of the new energy supply agreement reflecting the period over which the Company will benefit from the agreement.
Further information regarding the new energy supply arrangements is set out in note 21 of these financial statements.

The Group regularly monitors the carrying amount of its goodwill.
A review was undertaken at 31 March 2014 to assess whether the carrying amount of assets was supported by their value in use determined by the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow projections based on current levels of profitability.
A pre-tax discount rate of 20% into perpetuity was used which was considered appropriate given the expectation that, for the foreseeable future, TML will continue to operate as a going concern.
The result of the review undertaken at 31 March 2014 indicated that no impairment was necessary.
No reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the impairment calculation would give rise to an impairment of goodwill.

Capital management The Groups overall objective when managing capital is to continue to provide attractive returns to shareholders.
Total shareholder equity at 31 March 2014 was 206.0 million 2013: 70.7 million.
The Groups current capital management strategy is to retain sufficient working capital for day to day operating requirements.
In addition, as a result of the entering the new energy supply arrangements with Npower, and the consequent drawdown of transaction debt facilities of 100 million, the Groups capital management strategy is also to ensure that interest costs are minimised and that the schedule for repayment of the debt can be comfortably achieved.
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of energy to the Companys customers.
This includes funding the Budget Plans of customers who pay for their energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.

In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments IFRS 2, awards made under the Companys JSOP share incentive scheme are deemed to be cash-settled.
However, whilst approximately 3,395,000 of the share incentive scheme charge during the year relate to JSOP awards, and could therefore be settled in cash, in practice it is expected that any settlement of awards under the JSOP will be made in equity.
It has therefore been deemed appropriate to present the above analysis of earnings per share as adjusted for share incentive scheme charges.
It has also been deemed appropriate to present the analysis of adjusted earnings per share excluding the amortisation of intangible assets arising from the new energy supply agreement with Npower in order to present a clearer picture of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

Capital commitments At 31 March 2014 the Company had capital commitments of approximately 7,675,000 relating mainly to items in respect of the refurbishment of Merit House, the Groups new head office building 2013: 364,000.
New energy supply arrangements The Group entered into a new 20 year energy supply agreement with Npower the SSA on 20 December 2013.
In the event that the SSA is terminated by Npower in certain circumstances, including on a material breach by the Group or on the insolvency of the Company, additional consideration of up to 201 million may become payable by the Company to Npower.
Full details of the termination provisions of the SSA were set out in paragraph 4 of Part VIII on page 38 of the prospectus issued to shareholders on 20 November 2013.
However, given the energy supply agreement termination rights are either, in the directors view, very unlikely to occur or entirely within the control of the Group, the directors believe the likelihood of this type of termination event is remote.
The amount of the additional consideration reduces from 201 million to 11 million over the 20 year life of the supply agreement.
Furthermore, depending on the circumstances giving rise to a termination event, the additional consideration if payable may be spread over the unexpired term of the supply agreement.
Following any such termination event, the Group would have direct access to the wholesale energy markets and the opportunity to earn additional margin from sourcing energy directly for the Groups customer base.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company has two share option plans, one of which is available to employees, the other to distributors of the Company.
All new employees who have passed the requisite probationary period are issued with market price options over shares in the Company, further options are also granted to existing employees depending on their seniority and length of service The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Employee Share Option Plan.
The distributor scheme The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives to the people who are most successful in gathering new customers for the Company.
As it is not possible to measure directly the benefit received from these activities, the fair value of the benefit received has been measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
On 30 March 2011 the Company established a new Joint Share Ownership Plan The Telecom Plus PLC Joint Share Ownership Plan 2011 or the JSOP.
Under the terms of the JSOP 500,000 shares were issued to an Employee Benefit Trust the JSOP Share Trust administered by Barclays Wealth Guernsey Limited, which holds the shares jointly with the only current participant, Mr Lindsay.
The JSOP Share Trust was provided with an interest free loan from the Company to subscribe for the 500,000 shares, and therefore the transaction was cash flow neutral for the Company.
As set out in note u of the Significant Accounting Policies, JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a binomial pricing model.
The fair value liability is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the amortisation charge in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The following key assumptions were used to determine the fair value liability of the JSOP award of 1,207.9p per share as at 31 March 2014: a strike price of 553p per share, a share price of 1,793p as at 31 March 2014, expected volatility of 39.6%, an expected remaining life of 1 year, a risk free rate of 0.43% and an expected dividend yield of 1.95%.
A reconciliation of movements in the numbers of share options for the Group can be summarised as follows: 2014 2013 Number Weighted Number Weighted average average exercise price exercise price At 1 April 2,243,787 514p 2,014,652 356p Options granted 765,950 1,507p 1,030,800 790p Options exercised 653,888 310p 417,850 242p Options lapsed expired 434,700 1,060p 383,815 718p At 31 March 1,921,149 855p 2,243,787 514p The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised during the year was 1,612.9p 2013: 882.5p.

DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Treasury activities take place under procedures and policies approved and monitored by the Board.
They are designed to minimise the financial risks faced by the Group which primarily arise from credit, interest rate and liquidity risks.
Carrying amounts of financial instruments All financial assets, which include cash, trade and other receivables and accrued income, are classified as loans and receivables with a total value for the Group of 213,536,000 2013: 144,567,000 and for the Company of 63,811,000 2013: 146,331,000.
All financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables and accrued expenditure, are held at amortised cost with a total value for the Group of 251,858,000 2013: 105,316,000 and for the Company 132,350,000 2013: 108,193,000. Credit risk All customers are invoiced monthly and approximately 90% pay by direct debit: accordingly credit risk in respect of trade receivables is considered low due to the large number of customers supplied, each of whom represents an insignificant proportion of total revenue.
The Company has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers.
This means that although the Company is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from a potential new customer who is not considered creditworthy, the Company is obliged to supply domestic energy to anyone who submits a properly completed application form.
Where such customers subsequently fail to pay for the energy they have used delinquent customers, there is likely to be a delay before the Company is able to eliminate its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter or disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such delinquent customers from increasing their indebtedness are not always fully recoverable.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its day to day operations primarily through cash generated within the business.
Cash surpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank PLC at money market rates to maximise returns.
The Groups profit and equity for the current year will not be significantly affected by changes in the UK base rate of - 1% from current levels despite the recent increase in the level of net borrowings resulting from the transaction with Npower in December 2013.
Commodity price risk The Group is not exposed to any fluctuations in commodity prices due to the nature of the agreements with wholesale providers of telephony and energy services and its ability to pass the effect of any such fluctuations through to its customers.
Liquidity risk The Groups treasury management policies are designed to ensure continuity of funding.

Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling.
Receivables due after one year include 4,242,000 2013: 3,215,000 due from employees and distributors which earns interest at variable rates above Base Rate.

NEW ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS AND ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS The Company entered into new energy supply arrangements with Npower through the acquisition of Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited the Companies from Npower Limited on 20 December 2013 the Transaction.
The Transaction had economic effect from 1 December 2013.
The accounting treatment for the Transaction was considered against the guidance set out in IFRS 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3.
It was determined that the acquisition of the Companies did not represent business combinations under IFRS 3 as both Companies did not have the three key elements of a standalone business as set out in IFRS 3 i. e. inputs, processes and outputs.
The principal factors behind this determination were as follows: i the Companies were originally set up solely as legal vehicles to facilitate the supply of energy to Telecom Plus customers by Npower: ii all customer relationships were acquired, held and managed by Telecom Plus: iii the Companies did not have any influence over the terms on which energy was supplied to them: iv the Companies were not able to influence who their customers were and had no pricing discretion for the onward supply of energy: v the Companies did not have any infrastructure, management or employees with all functions being carried out by either Telecom Plus or Npower: and vi given the unique nature of the Companies and the associated energy supply agreement between Telecom Plus and Npower, it was not considered feasible that another market participant could effectively acquire and operate the Companies on a standalone basis.
As a result of these factors the acquisition of the Companies has been accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than as business combinations.
