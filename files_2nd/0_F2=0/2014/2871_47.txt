Net deferred tax liability asset 12.5 7.1 Deferred income tax credit 29.1 16.6 The Group has tax losses and other temporary differences of 117.4m 2013: 93.8m that are available for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses or other temporary differences arose, of which 90.9m are related to losses incurred by companies acquired by the Group and therefore not as a result of the Groups trading performance.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of 117.4m 2013: 93.8m of these losses or other temporary differences, as their recoverability is uncertain.
The UK corporation tax rate will decrease from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The deferred tax balance has been adjusted to reflect this change.
