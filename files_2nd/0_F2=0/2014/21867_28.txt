d Loans to group undertakings Loans to group undertakings are recognised initially at transaction price which is the fair value, including transaction costs incurred except in the initial measurement of financial liabilities that are measured at fair value through profit or loss less amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, in accordance with Section 11 of FRS 102 Basic Financial Instruments.

e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.

212 Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PREPARATION continued g Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences which are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income that arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements, except that: Provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the statement of financial position date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: Where there are differences between amounts that can be deducted for tax for assets other than goodwill and liabilities compared with the amounts that are recognised for those assets and liabilities in a business combination a deferred tax liability asset shall be recognised.
The amount attributed to goodwill is adjusted by the amount of the deferred tax recognised: and Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
h Sharebased payments The fair value of equity instruments granted under share-based payment plans are recognised as an expense and spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards made at the grant date, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
At the date of each statement of financial position, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The fair value of the awards and ultimate expense are not adjusted on a change in market vesting conditions during the vesting period.

This Note explains the different schemes used to facilitate those share-based payments.
A number of long-term employee incentive schemes are settled with Brit PLC shares.
These schemes are described below and further information is available in the Remuneration Committee Report.
The compensation cost under Section 3 of Financial Reporting Standard 103 in respect of these schemes is shown below: Period from 19 December 2013 to 31 December 2014 m Equity-settled plans: Performance Share Plan PSP 0.2 Brit All Employee Share plan 0.1 Cash-settled plans: PSP dividend equivalents settled in cash 0.1 Total 0.4 The cost has been recognised in the financial statements of the subsidiary companies where the staff are employed.
a Performance Share Plan PSP During 2014 selected employees were awarded the right to acquire a defined number of Brit PLC shares at no cost to the employee.
Subject to continued service and the satisfaction of the performance conditions, the right to acquire shares may be exercised in differing proportions with effect from the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date.
These proportions are 50%, 25% and 25% respectively.
The performance conditions are: 75% of each award is subject to achieving specific targets for average annual Return on Net Tangible Assets RoNTA over a fixed three-year performance period: and 25% of each award is subject to the Groups total shareholder return TSR achieving specific targets relative to a bespoke industry comparator group over a three-year performance period.
Participants do not receive any dividends until after the shares have been received.
A payment may be made at the time of vesting to reflect the dividend that would have accrued on vested shares between the date of grant and vesting.
The fair value of the PSP share awards with a TSR performance condition is calculated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation.
This valuation process simulates the future TSRs for the Group and each stock in the comparator group over the three-year performance period.
The TSR for each stock is simulated by assuming a log-normal model of share returns.
The inputs to that model are: the risk-free interest rate, expected future dividends, the expected volatility of share returns over the life of the awards and the historical correlation matrix of returns between companies.
Expected dividends are deducted in the calculation of fair value because any dividends accrued over the vesting period are expected to be paid separately in cash.
The fair value of the PSP share awards with a RoNTA performance condition is equal to the share price on date of grant less the value of expected dividends in respect of the shares.
The value of expected dividends is excluded because it is anticipated, as for the PSP awards with vesting based on TSR, that they will be paid separately in cash.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 217 13 SHAREBASED PAYMENTS continued For PSP share awards granted during the year, the following key assumptions have been made: Period from 19 December 2013 to 31 December 2014 Risk-free interest rate 3-5 year terms 1.3% 1.8% pa Expected volatility 22.0% pa Expected dividend yield 7.7% pa The risk-free rate is equal to the yields available on zero-coupon UK government bonds at the date of grant with terms equal to the expected lives of the awards.
Expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of the Groups share returns since the IPO and the historic volatility of the comparator group companies over periods commensurate with the expected term of the awards.
The expected dividend yield is based on declared dividends and the Groups dividend policy as at the date of grant divided by the share price on the date of grant.
The calculation of the compensation cost recognised in the income statement in respect of these awards assumes forfeitures due to employee turnover of 5% per annum prior to vesting, with subsequent adjustments to reflect actual experience.
Reconciliation of movement in the number of PSP awards Period from 19 December 2013 to 31 December 2014 Outstanding at 1 January Granted 2,596,365 Forfeited Exercised Outstanding at 31 December 2,596,365 There were no awards exercisable at the end of the year.
The weighted average fair value at date of grant for equity-settled awards granted during 2014 was 158p.
The weighted average remaining contractual life at the end of the year was 3.7 years.
b Brit AllEmployee Share Plan The Brit All-Employee Share Plan comprising the Share Incentive Plan SIP for UK employees and the International Share Incentive Plan for overseas employees provides for the award of Free Shares, Partnership Shares, Matching Shares and Dividend Shares.
In 2014, Free Share awards were granted with a vesting period of three years from the Award Date.
Vesting is unconditional for participants still in-service at the vesting date.
Participants will receive further shares Dividend Shares representing the value of reinvested dividends that would have accrued over the vesting period on the shares in the Free Shareaward.
The fair value of the Brit All-Employee Share Plan awards is equal to the share price on date of grant.
Dividends are not deducted in the calculation of fair value because it is assumed that any dividends will be accumulated over the vesting period and repaid in equivalent shares.
The calculation of the compensation cost recognised in the income statement in respect of these awards assumes forfeitures due to employee turnover of 10% per annum prior to vesting, with subsequent adjustments to reflect actual experience.
