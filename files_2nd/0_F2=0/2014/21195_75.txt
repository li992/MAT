The effect of differences between actual and expected economic experience on liabilities, and changes to economic assumptions used to value liabilities, are taken outside operating profit.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
For other long-term business the profit impact of economic volatility depends on the degree of matching of assets and liabilities, and exposure to financial options and guarantees.
d Assumptions The expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected investment return for equities and properties are: Equities Properties 2014 2013 2014 2013 % % % % United Kingdom 6.6 5.4 5.1 3.9 Eurozone 5.7 5.1 4.2 3.6 The expected return on equities and properties is calculated by reference to the opening 10-year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk margin.
These are the same assumptions as are used under MCEV principles to calculate the longer-term investment return for the Groups long-term business.
For fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held less an adjustment for credit risks: this includes an adjustment for credit risk on all eurozone sovereign debt.
Where such securities are classified as available for sale, the expected investment return comprises the expected interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase.
10 Longer-term investment return and economic assumption changes for non-long-term business For non-long-term business, the total investment income, including realised and unrealised gains, is split between a calculated longer-term return, which is included in operating profit, and short-term fluctuations from this, which are disclosed outside operating profit but are included in profit before tax.
This note gives details of the longer-term return calculation and the relevant assumptions, as well as the economic assumption changes on our general insurance and health business.
a The short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes attributable to the non-long-term business result and reported outside operating profit were as follows: 2014 2013 Non-long-term business m m Short-term fluctuations in investment return see b below continuing operations 261 336 Economic assumption changes continuing operations see g below 145 33 116 303 b The longer-term investment return and short-term fluctuation for continuing operations are as follows: 2014 2013 Non-long-term business - Continuing operations m m Analysis of investment income: Net investment income 754 266 Foreign exchange gains losses and other charges 8 35 746 231 Analysed between: Longer-term investment return, reported within operating profit 485 567 Short-term fluctuation in investment return, reported outside operating profit General insurance and health 181 243 1 Other operations 80 93 261 336 746 231 1 For 2014 represents short-term fluctuations on assets backing non-long-term business in Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme.
For 2013 represents short-term fluctuations on assets backing non-longterm business in the France holding company and Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme.
c The longer-term investment return is calculated separately for each principal non-long-term business unit.
In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer-term rate of investment return.
The longer-term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer-term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.
Actual income and longer-term investment return both contain the amortisation of the discounts premium arising on the acquisition of fixed income securities.
For other operations, the longer-term return reflects assets backing non-long-term business held in Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme.

The favourable movement in short term fluctuations during 2014 compared with 2013 is mainly due to a decrease in risk free rates increasing fixed income security market values, and other market movements impacting Group centre investments and the centre hedging programme.

As explained in accounting policy L, provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims.
The discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period, with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.
The range of discount rates used is disclosed in note 41.
