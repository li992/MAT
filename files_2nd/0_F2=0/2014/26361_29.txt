Impairment losses An impairment loss is the reduction in value that arises following an impairment review of an asset that determines that the assets value is lower than its carrying value.
For impaired financial assets measured at amortised cost, impairment losses are the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
Impairment losses can be difficult to assess and the critical accounting estimates and judgements in note 3 detail the key assessments made when determining impairment losses.
Individually collectively assessed Impairment is measured individually for assets that are individually significant, and collectively where a portfolio comprises homogenous assets and where appropriate statistical techniques are available.
