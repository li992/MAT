18 Financial instruments The main financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity risk, market risk comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk and credit risk.
Financial instruments are used to finance the Group businesses and to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
The Groups businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions.
Details of financial instruments subject to liquidity, market and credit risks are described below.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains a range of borrowing facilities and debt programmes to fund its requirements, at short notice and at competitive rates.
The balance of long-term debt, short-term debt and committed bank facilities is managed to provide security of funding, taking into account the cash generation cycle of the business and the uncertain size and timing of acquisition spend.
To accommodate the significant free cash ow generated by the Group and to capitalise on an inexpensive source of funding, a meaningful portion of the overall debt portfolio is typically kept short term as long as there exists acceptable liquidity in the commercial paper markets and sufficient capacity under committed credit lines.
The treasury policies ensure adequate liquidity by requiring a that no more than $1.5bn of term debt matures in any 12-month period, b that the sum of term debt maturing over the ensuing 12 months plus commercial paper is less thanthe sum of available cash plus committed facilities and c minimum levels of borrowing with maturities over three and five years are maintained.
The treasury policies ensure debt efficiency by a targeting certain levels of commercial paper across a given year, b maintaining a weighted average maturity of the gross debt portfolio of approximately 5 years and c minimising surplus cash balances.
From time to time, based on cash ow and market conditions, the Group may redeem term debt early or repurchase outstanding debt in the open market.
Debt is issued to meet the funding requirements of various jurisdictions and in the currency that is needed.
It is recognised that debt can act as a natural translation hedge of earnings and net assets in currencies other than the reporting currencies.
For this reason, a significant proportion of the Groups net debt has historically been denominated in US dollars, reecting the size and importance of the US businesses.
There were no changes to the Groups long-term approach to capital and liquidity management during the year.
The remaining contractual maturities for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are shown in the table below.
The table shows undiscounted principal and interest cash ows and includes contractual gross cash ows to be exchanged as part of cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts where there is a legal right of set-off.

The carrying amount of derivative financial assets comprises 46m 2013: 84m inrelation to fair value hedges, 60m 2013: 88m in relation to cash ow hedges and 3m 2013: 29m not designated as hedging instruments.
The expected cash ows in respect of the cash collateral have been included in the tables above together with the cash ows for the related cross-currency interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had access to a $2,000m committed bank facility maturing in July 2019, which was undrawn.
This facility backs up short-term borrowings.
All borrowings that mature within the next two years can be covered by the facility and by utilising available cash resources.
The committed bank facility, together with certain private placements, are subject to financial covenants typical to the Groups size and financial strength.
The Group had significant headroom within these covenants for the year ended 31 December 2014.
There are no financial covenants in any outstanding public bonds.
Market risk The Groups primary market risks are to interest rate uctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by the Group for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations and taxation is excluded from the following market risk sensitivity analysis.
indd 121 06 03 2015 12:43 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 122 NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 18 Financial instruments continued Interest rate exposure management The Groups interest rate exposure management policy aims to reduce the exposure of the combined businesses to changes in interest rates at efficient cost.
To achieve this the Group uses xed rate term debt, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and interest rate options.
Interest rate derivatives are used only to hedge an underlying risk and no net market positions are held.
At 31 December 2014, 52% of gross borrowings were either xed rate or had been xed through the use of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net finance costs of 16m 2013: 12m, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2014.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net finance costs of 16m 2013: 12m.
The impact on net equity of a theoretical change in interest rates as at 31 December 2014 is restricted to the change in carrying value of oating rate to xed rate interest rate derivatives in a designated cash ow hedge relationship and undesignated interest rate derivatives, of which there were none in the Group as at 31 December 2014.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would therefore result in a reduction in net equity of nil 2013: nil and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase net equity by nil 2013: 1m.
The impact of a change in interest rates on the carrying value of xed rate borrowings in a designated fair value hedge relationship would be offset by the change in carrying value of the related interest rate derivative.
Fixed rate borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are carried at amortised cost.
Foreign currency exposure management Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in countries other than those of each parent company.
Some of these exposures are offset by denominating borrowings in US dollars.
Currency exposures on transactions denominated in a foreign currency are generally hedged using forward contracts.
In addition, recurring transactions and future investment exposures may be hedged, in advance of becoming contractual.
The precise policy differs according to the specic circumstances of the individual businesses.
Highly predictable future cash ows may be covered for transactions expected to occur during the next 24 months 50months for the scientific, Technical & Medical subscription businesses within limits dened according to the period before the transaction is expected to become contractual.
Cover takes the form of foreign exchange forward contracts.
As at 31 December 2014, the amount of outstanding foreign exchange cover against future transactions was 1.4bn 2013: 1.3bn.
A theoretical weakening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2014 would decrease the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 524m 2013: 500m.
This would be offset to a degree by a decrease in net borrowings of 255m 2013: 246m.
A strengthening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2014 would increase the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 524m 2013: 500m and increase net borrowings by 255m 2013: 246m.
A retranslation of the combined businesses net profit for the year assuming a 10% weakening of all foreign currencies against sterling but excluding transactional exposures would reduce net profit by 80m 2013: 92m.
A 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies against sterling on this basis would increase net profit for the year by 80m 2013: 92m.
Credit risk The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
Theamount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them.
In certain situations, the Group enters into credit support arrangements with derivative counterparties to mitigate the credit exposures arising from hedge gains on the related financial instruments.
Under these arrangements, the Group receives or pays cash collateral equal to the mark to market valuation of the related derivative asset or liability on monthly settlement dates.
At31December 2014, 4m 2013: 13m of cash collateral had been received, and the resulting payable balance was added to the related derivative liabilities of1m 2013: 13m offset against the related derivative assets of 12m in the statement of financial position.
The Group has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than AA3 by Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch.
At 31 December 2014, cash and cash equivalents totalled 276m 2013: 132m, of which 96% 2013: 90% was held with banks rated AA3 or better.
indd 122 06 03 2015 12:43 Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information RELX Group Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2014 123 18 Financial instruments continued The Group also has credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers that include national and state governments, academic institutions and large and small enterprises including law rms, book stores and wholesalers.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Where appropriate, business units seek to minimise this exposure by taking payment in advance and through management of credit terms.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing prole, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the statement of financial position.
Included within trade receivables are the following amounts which are past due but for which no allowance has been made.
Past due up to one month 136m 2013: 156m : past due two to three months 66m 2013: 76m : past due four to six months 30m 2013: 26m : and past due greater than six months 7m 2013: 7m.
Examples of trade receivables which are past due but for which no allowance has been made include those receivables where there is no concern over the creditworthiness of the customer and where the history of dealings with the customer indicate the amount will be settled.
Hedge accounting The hedging relationships that are designated under IAS39 Financial Instruments are described below: Fair value hedges The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of xed rate borrowings due to interest rate and foreign currency movements which could affect the income statement.
Interest rate derivatives including cross-currency interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 908m were in place at 31 December 2014 swapping xed rate term debt issues denominated in US dollars USD, sterling and euros to oating rate USD, sterling and euro debt respectively for the whole or part of their term 2013: 1,104m swapping xed rate term debt issues denominated in USD, sterling, euros and Swiss francs CHF to oating rate USD, sterling, euro and USD debt respectively for the whole or part of their term.
The gains and losses on the borrowings and related derivatives designated as fair value hedges, which are included in the income statement, for the two years ended 31 December 2014 were as follows: GAINS LOSSES ON BORROWINGS Fair value Fair value AND RELATED DERIVATIVES 1 January movement Exchange 1 January movement Exchange 31 December 2013 gain loss gain loss 2014 gain loss gain loss 2014 m m m m m m m 6 6 USD debt 3 3 Related interest rate swaps 6 6 3 3 GBP debt 36 17 19 1 20 Related interest rate swaps 36 17 19 1 20 EUR debt 8 13 1 4 31 1 26 Related interest rate swaps 8 13 1 4 31 1 26 CHF debt 80 14 1 65 65 Related CHF to USD cross-currency interest rate swaps 80 14 1 65 65 Total relating to USD, GBP, EUR and CHF debt 124 50 74 30 1 43 Total related interest rate derivatives 124 50 74 30 1 43 Net gain All fair value hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2014.
Gross borrowings as at 31 December 2014 included 29m 2013: 31m in relation to fair value adjustments to borrowings previously designated in a fair value hedge relationship which were fide-designated in 2008.
The related derivatives were closed out on fide-designation with a cash inow of 62m.
4m 2013: 5m of these fair value adjustments were amortised in the year as a reduction tonance costs.

2 Revenue hedges comprising forward foreign exchange contracts which x the exchange rate on a portion of future foreign currency subscription revenues forecast by the scientific, Technical & Medical businesses for up to 50 months.
Movements in the hedge reserve in 2013 and 2014, including gains and losses on cash ow hedging instruments, were asfollows: Total hedge Debt Revenue reserve hedges hedges pre-tax m m m Hedge reserve at 1 January 2013: losses gains deferred 2 37 35 Gains arising in 2013 1 64 65 Amounts recognised in income statement 3 6 3 Exchange translation differences 1 1 Hedge reserve at 1 January 2014: gains deferred 2 94 96 Losses arising in 2014 52 29 81 Amounts recognised in income statement 56 37 19 Exchange translation differences 1 1 Hedge reserve at 31 December 2014: gains deferred 6 29 35 All cash ow hedges were highly effective throughout the two years ended 31 December 2014.
A tax charge of 10m 2013: 23m in respect of the above gains and losses at 31 December 2014 was also deferred in the hedge reserve.
Of the amounts recognised in the income statement in the year, gains of 37m 2013: 6m were recognised in revenue, and losses of 56m 2013: 3m were recognised in finance costs.
A tax charge of 9m 2013: 1m was recognised in relation to these items.
The deferred gains and losses on cash ow hedges at 31 December 2014 are currently expected to be recognised in the income statement in future years as follows: Total hedge Debt Revenue reserve hedges hedges pre-tax m m m 2015 1 24 23 2016 6 6 2017 2 2 2018 5 1 6 2019 Gains deferred in hedge reserve at end of year 6 29 35 The cash ows for these hedges are expected to occur in line with the recognition of the gains and losses in the income statement, other than in respect of certain forward foreign exchange hedges on subscriptions, where cash ows may occur in advance of the subscriptionyear.
