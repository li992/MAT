136 Financial Statements Notes to the Parent Company Accounts 1.
Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets andliabilities including derivatives and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and standards in the UK UK GAAP andcomply with the Companies Act 2006.
Principal accounting policies Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
In the opinion of the Directors the value of such investments are not less than shown at the balance sheet date.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost where hedge accounting is not applied : any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Where fair value hedge accounting is applied, the borrowings are subsequently revalued at each balance sheet date and the difference is offset against the fair value movement of the derivative the hedging instrument in the profit and loss account.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has a continuing right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date under both its committed bank credit facility and Euro Medium-Term Note Programme.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions orevents that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the taxable profits and results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all the available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable profits against which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can bededucted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Neither is deferred tax recognised on overseas profits where there is no commitment to remit those profits to the UK.
Deferred tax is measured at the average rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a nondiscounted basis.
