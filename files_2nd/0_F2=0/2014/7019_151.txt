Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Before recognition of any impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Process Safety Gas Detection Bursting Discs 6,977 7,620 Safety Interlocks 7,357 7,609 14,334 15,229 Infrastructure Safety Fire 12,172 11,675 Doors, Security & Elevators 68,465 69,988 80,637 81,663 Medical Health Optics 117,571 123,123 Fluid Technology 31,095 33,749 148,666 156,872 Environmental & Analysis Water 27,252 27,929 Photonics 53,184 57,855 Environmental Monitoring 11,205 12,237 91,641 98,021 Total Group 335,278 351,785 Goodwill values have been tested for impairment by comparing them against the value in use in perpetuity of the relevant CGUs.
The value in use calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived from the latest budget approved by the Board, discounted at CGU specific, risk adjusted, discount rates to calculate their net present value.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions: CGU specific operating assumptions that are reflected in the budget period for the financial year to March 2015: Discount rates: Growth rates used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period.
120 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 120 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements CGU specific operating assumptions are applicable to the budgeted cash flows for the year to March 2015 and relate to revenue forecasts, expected project outcomes and forecast operating margins in each of the operating companies.
The relative value ascribed to each assumption will vary between CGUs as the budgets are built up from the underlying operating companies within each CGU.
A short-term growth rate is applied to the March 2015 budget to derive the cash flows arising in the year to March 2016 and a longterm rate is applied to these values for the year to March 2017 and onwards, as described below.
Discount rates are based on estimations of the assumptions that market participants operating in similar sectors to Halma would make, using the Groups economic profile as a starting point and adjusting appropriately.
The Directors do not currently expect any significant change in the present base discount rate of 10.65% 2013: 10.51%.
The base discount rate, which is pre-tax and is based on short-term variables, may differ from the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC used in long-term return measures such as ROTIC.
Discount rates are adjusted for economic risks that are not already captured in the specific operating assumptions for each CGU.
This results in the impairment testing using discount rates ranging from 10.52% to 13.70% 2013: 9.36% to 14.59% across all CGUs.
CGUs to which 10% or more of the total goodwill balance is allocated are deemed to be significant.
The assumptions used to determine value in use for these CGUs are: Risk adjusted discount rate Short-term growth rates Long-term growth rates Significant CGU 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 Doors, Security & Elevators 13.70% 14.05% 5.09% 3.25% 2.14% 2.50% Health Optics 12.88% 14.59% 1.49% 3.25% 2.35% 2.50% Photonics 11.61% 9.52% 2.07% 3.25% 2.16% 2.50% Short-term growth rates are based on sectoral organic growth rates achieved in the current year, but are capped at the Groups overall current year organic growth rate to ensure that future uncertainties are adequately reflected.
Long-term growth rates are capped at the weighted average GDP growth rates of the markets that the Group sells into.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
