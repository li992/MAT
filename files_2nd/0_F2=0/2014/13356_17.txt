10 Intangible assets 000 Cost and carrying amount At 31 December 2012, 29 and 30 December 2013 and 28 December 2014 26,433 Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is subject to an impairment review annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Therefore, goodwill arising on acquisition is monitored and an impairment test is carried out which compares the value in use of each cash generating unit CGU to its carrying value.
The intangible assets reported on the balance sheet represent goodwill arising on the acquisition of Blubeckers Limited and Brunning and Price Limited, which now trade as Pub restaurants.
Value in use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and three year business plans approved by the Board.
Cash flows are then extrapolated in perpetuity with an annual growth rate of 2%.
Perpetuity is believed to be reasonable due to the significant proportion of freeholds in the estate and the nature of the leasehold properties.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9.7% 2013: 9.9% which is the rate believed by the Directors to reflect the risks associated with the CGU.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions arising from a range of possible trading and economic scenarios.
The scenarios have been performed separately with the sensitivities summarised as follows: An increase in the discount rate of 1% A decrease of 5% on forecast cash flows The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would result from either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in forecast cash flows.

Interest is payable at floating interest rates which fluctuate and are dependent on LIBOR and base rate.
The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 1.75% 2013: 1.74%.
The Group has in place a five year 140m loan facility.
This facility provides the Group with medium-term security of funding, additional capacity to take advantage of business opportunities as they become available and the flexibility to optimise the Groups funding structure.
Interest is payable on the amount drawn down at LIBOR plus mandatory cost and the banks margin, which is dependent on the debt to EBITDA ratio.
The Group has a 10m overdraft facility, which is repayable on demand, on which interest is payable at the banks overdraft rate.
At 28 December 2014 the Group has 100m of committed borrowing facilities in excess of gross borrowings 29 December 2013: 90m and 10m of undrawn overdraft 29 December 2013: 10m of undrawn overdraft.
The maturity profile of anticipated gross future cash flows, including interest, relating to the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis, are set out below: At 28 December 2014 Trade and other Floating Finance payables rate lease excluding tax loan debt Total 000 000 000 000 Within one year 94,219 259 332 94,810 Within two to five years 41,761 1,326 43,087 After five years 11,475 11,475 94,219 42,020 13,133 149,372 Less: future interest payments 2,562 9,871 12,433 94,219 39,458 3,262 136,939 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2014 83 At 29 December 2013 Trade and other Floating Finance payables rate lease excluding tax loan debt Total 000 000 000 000 Within one year 87,740 10,967 330 99,037 Within two to five years 43,584 1,318 44,902 After five years 11,597 11,597 87,740 54,551 13,245 155,536 Less: future interest payments 5,387 10,030 15,417 87,740 49,164 3,215 140,119 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are accounted for at cost and the Directors consider the carrying value to approximate their fair value.
b Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group.
Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with large established financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet their obligations.
As a retail business with trading receipts settled either by cash or credit and debit cards, there is very limited exposure from customer transactions.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of commercial discounts receivable from suppliers but the Directors believe adequate provision has been made in respect of doubtful debts and there are no material amounts past due that have not been provided against.
The Group has an outstanding long-term receivable of 4m from BH Restaurants Limited.
As a result of a detailed trading review of the business, the Board has made full provision against the loan note due further details are provided in note 12.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
c Liquidity risk The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reserves and bank facility by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups loan facility, which matures in October 2016 as set out in note a above ensures continuity of funding, provided the Group continues to meet its covenant requirements as detailed in the report of the Directors on page 24. d Foreign currency risk The Group is not materially exposed to changes in foreign currency rates and does not use foreign exchange forward contracts.
Following the closure of the Groups three restaurants in Spain in 2011, any transactional or translational exposure to changes in foreign exchange rate is marginal and relates to the outstanding transactions in relation to the termination of the Spanish business.
e Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate movements has been controlled historically through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve a balanced interest rate profile.
The Group does not currently have any interest rate swaps in place as the continued reduction in the level of debt combined with current market conditions results in a low level of exposure.
The Groups exposure will continue to be monitored and the use of interest rate swaps may be considered in the future.
84 Annual Report 2014 The Restaurant Group plc Notes to the accounts continued 24 Lease commitments Future lease payments in respect of finance leases are due as follows: Present value of Minimum lease minimum lease payments payments 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 Within one year 332 330 332 330 Within two to five years 1,326 1,318 1,017 1,010 After five years 11,475 11,597 1,913 1,875 13,133 13,245 Less: future interest payments 9,871 10,030 Present value of lease obligations 3,262 3,215 3,262 3,215 Analysed as: Amount due for settlement within one year 332 330 Amount due for settlement after one year 2,930 2,885 Present value of lease obligations 3,262 3,215 Lease commitments are in respect of property leases where the initial term of the lease is in excess of 25 years and the conditions of the lease are in keeping with a finance lease.
There are no finance leases where the Group itself is the lessor.
The interest rate applied in calculating the present value of the payments is the incremental borrowing cost of the Group in relation to each lease.
The fair value of the lease payments is estimated as 3.3m 2013: 3.2m.
The total future minimum rentals payable and receivable under operating leases over the remaining lives of the leases are: Payable Receivable Payable Receivable 2014 2014 2013 2013 Payments due: 000 000 000 000 Within one year 57,902 2,642 55,923 2,866 Within two to five years 200,990 8,523 190,678 9,326 After five years 451,385 20,477 437,500 25,263 710,277 31,642 684,101 37,455 The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms, both as lessee and lessor.
There are no restrictions imposed by the Groups operating lease arrangements, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable on properties where the rental payment is based on turnover.
For these properties, primarily in the Groups Concession business, the amount included above is the minimum guaranteed rent as detailed in the concession agreement.
Where there is no minimum guaranteed rent, the amount included is based on the estimated amount payable.
25 Capital commitments 2014 2013 000 000 Authorised and contracted for: 45,551 40,053 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2014 85 26 Contingent liabilities The Group has assigned a number of leases to third parties that were originally completed prior to 1 January 1996 and are therefore unaffected by the Landlord and Tenant Covenants Act 1995 and also a number of leases completed after this date that were the subject of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.
Consequently, should the current tenant default, the landlord has a right of recourse to The Restaurant Group plc, or its subsidiaries, for future rental payments.
As and when any liability arises, the Group will take whatever steps necessary to mitigate the costs.
