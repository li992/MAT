Financial statements 152 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2014 20 Retirement benefits The Group operates post-retirement defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans for many of its employees.
It also operates two post-retirement medical plans.
Defined contribution plans The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans of 7 million 2013: 11 million is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
There were no material outstanding or prepaid contributions recognised in relation to these plans as at the reporting dates presented.
The expected contributions to be paid to defined contribution plans during 2015 are 7 million 2014: 6 million.
Defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans The Group operates in excess of 100 retirement plans across its global operations.
A large proportion of the Groups defined benefit plans are closed to new members.
The most significant unfunded defined benefit plans are operated in Austria, Germany and Russia and funded plans are operated primarily in the United Kingdom.
These plans are established in accordance with applicable local labour legislation and or collective agreements with participating employees.
The majority of these plans are unfunded and provide pensions and severance benefits to members of those plans.
The benefits are based on a variety of factors, the most significant of which are a combination of pensionable service and final salary.
Anumber of these plans also provide additional benefits in the event of death in service, disability or ill-health retirement which are derived from the final salary benefit formula.
The assets of the funded plans are held separately in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice where those funds are operated.
The boards of trustees of these plans are required to act in the best interest of the plans and all relevant stakeholders of the plans active employees, inactive employees, retirees and employers and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the plans.
The post-retirement medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain of their dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The South African plan is unfunded while the Austrian plan is funded.
The South African plan has been closed to new participants since 1 January 1999.
Except for the actuarial risks set out below, the Group has not identified any additional specific risks in respect of these plans.
Defined benefit plans typically expose the Group to the following actuarial risks: Investment risk Asset volatility The present value of the net retirement benefit liability asset is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high-quality bond yields.
If the return on plan assets is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit that needs to be funded guaranteed by the employer.
Currently the plan assets have a relatively balanced investment in equity and bonds.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the boards of trustees consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in equities.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase plan liabilities, however this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plans debt instruments.
Longevity risk The present value of the net retirement benefit liability asset is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
Anincrease in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan liabilities.
Salary risk The present value of the net retirement benefit liability asset is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants.
An increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan liabilities.
Medical cost inflation risk The present value of the post-retirement medical plans is calculated by reference to expected future medical costs.
An increase in medical cost inflation will increase the plan liabilities.
Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations every year using the projected unit credit method.
Mondi Group | Integrated report and financial statements 2014 Financial statements 153 Actuarial assumptions The weighted average principal assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are detailed below: 2014 2013 South Other South Other % Africa Europe regions Africa Europe regions Discount rate 8.3 2.3 5.9 8.7 3.8 6.1 Rate of inflation 6.5 2.3 5.2 6.6 2.4 8.4 Rate of increase in salaries 7.5 2.8 6.0 7.6 3.2 8.0 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 1.9 2.1 2.0 1.3 Expected average increase of medical cost trend rates 8.0 4.1 8.1 4.1 The assumption for the discount rate for plan liabilities is based on AA corporate bonds, which are of a suitable duration and currency.
InSouth Africa, the discount rate assumption has been based on the zero coupon government bond yield curve.
Mortality assumptions The assumed life expectancies on retirement at age 65 are: 2014 2013 South Other South Other years Africa Europe regions Africa Europe regions Retiring today Males 15.99 13.98-22.70 13.93 15.94 13.86-22.70 13.93 Females 19.93 17.35-26.89 17.72 19.89 17.08-26.77 17.72 Retiring in 20 years Males 20.44 13.98-23.00 13.93 20.34 13.86-22.70 13.93 Females 24.74 14.00-26.00 17.72 24.64 14.00-25.99 17.72 The mortality assumptions have been based on published mortality tables in the relevant jurisdictions.
The market value of assets is used to determine the funding level of the plans and is sufficient to cover 75% 2013: 76% of the benefits which have accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
Companies within the Group are paying contributions at rates agreed with the plans trustees and in accordance with local actuarial advice and statutory provisions.
The expected maturity analysis of undiscounted retirement benefits is as follows: 2014 2013 Defined PostDefined Postbenefit retirement benefit retirement pension medical pension medical million plans plans Total plans plans Total Less than a year 10 7 17 8 7 15 Between one to two years 10 11 21 8 11 19 Between two to five years 29 20 49 25 20 45 After five years 276 98 374 246 102 348 The weighted average duration of the defined retirement benefits liability for South Africa is 11 years, Europe 15 years and other regions 12 years.
It is expected that the Groups share of contributions will increase as the schemes members age.
The expected contributions to be paid to defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans during 2015 are 18 million 2014: 17 million.

No investments in equity or equity funds are allowed.
Due to legal and market restrictions asset-liability matching is not possible.
UK The trustees invest in diverse portfolios of pooled funds.
The long-term objective is to ensure that each plan can continue to meet the benefit payments without exposing either the plan or the company to an undue level of risk.
The mix of investments in each plan is determined taking into account the maturity, currency and nature of the expected benefit payments required.
There are no financial instruments or property owned by the Group included in the fair value of plan assets.
The fair values of equity, bonds, property, insurance contracts and cash are determined based on quoted prices in active markets.
The actual return on plan assets in respect of defined benefit plans was a gain of 16 million 2013: gain of 9 million.
Sensitivity analyses The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
The sensitivity analyses may not be representative of the actual changes in the net retirement benefits asset liability as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be inter-related.
The projected unit credit method was used to calculate the sensitivity analyses below.
A 1% change in the assumptions would have the following effects on the net retirement benefits plans: 1% 1% million increase decrease Discount rate Effect on current service cost 1 Effect on net retirement benefit asset liability 51 68 Rate of inflation Effect on current service cost 1 Effect on net retirement benefit asset liability 33 27 Rate of increase in salaries Effect on current service cost Effect on net retirement benefit asset liability 12 10 Mondi Group | Integrated report and financial statements 2014
