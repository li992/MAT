This note analyses the effect of the changes.
This note only allows for the impact on liabilities and related assets, such as unallocated divisible surplus, reinsurance, deferred acquisition costs and AVIF, and does not allow for offsetting movements in the value of backing financial assets.
Effect on Effect on profit 2014 profit 2013 m m Assumptions Long-term insurance business Interest rates 4,578 1,389 Expenses 75 3 Persistency rates 15 1 Mortality for assurance contracts 20 8 Mortality for annuity contracts 283 85 Tax and other assumptions 75 20 Investment contracts Interest rates 2 Expenses Persistency rates Tax and other assumptions General insurance and health business Change in loss ratio assumptions 3 Change in discount rate assumptions 145 33 Change in expense ratio and other assumptions 1 Total 4,256 1,540 The impact of interest rates on long-term business relates primarily to UK annuities, where a reduction in the valuation interest rates has increased liabilities.
The overall impact on profit also depends on movements in the value of assets backing the liabilities, which is not included in this disclosure.
There has been a release of expense reserves for the UK annuity business as a result of continuing restructuring and process improvements, reducing the current and long term cost base and a release of mortality reserves following the annual review of experience, most of which relates to annuitant mortality.
Tax and other assumptions includes the effect of changes in the equity release default assumptions used to derive the valuation interest rate for UK annuities resulting in a 163 million reduction in annuity liabilities changes in other default risk assumptions are included within interest rate changes.
This is partially offset by a write down of DAC in the UK in part to include the impact of the DWP announcement of a 0.75% charge cap and ban on active member discounts.
The adverse change in discount rate assumptions on general insurance and health business of 145 million 2013: 33 million favourable arises mainly as a result of a decrease in the swap rates used to discount latent claims reserves and periodic payment orders.
