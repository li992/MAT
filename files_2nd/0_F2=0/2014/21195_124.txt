The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments, including both exchange traded and over-the-counter instruments, in line with our overall risk management strategy.
The objectives include managing exposure to price, foreign currency and or interest rate risk on existing assets or liabilities, as well as planned or anticipated investment purchases.
In the narrative and tables below, figures are given for both the notional amounts and fair values of these instruments.
The notional amounts reflect the aggregate of individual derivative positions on a gross basis and so give an indication of the overall scale of the derivative transaction.
They do not reflect current market values of the open positions.
The fair values represent the gross carrying values at the year end for each class of derivative contract held or issued by the Group.
The fair values do not provide an indication of credit risk, as many over-the-counter transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. master agreements or their equivalent.
Such agreements are designed to provide a legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which reduces credit exposure.
In addition, the Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties, refer to note 60 for further information on collateral and net credit risk of derivative instruments.
a Instruments qualifying for hedge accounting The Group has formally assessed and documented the effectiveness of its instruments qualifying for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
To reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, the Group has designated a portion of its euro denominated debt as a hedge of the net investment in its European subsidiaries.
The carrying value of the debt at 31 December 2014 was 1,292 million 2013: 1,428 million and its fair value at that date was 1,359 million 2013: 1,516 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 94 million 2013: loss of 40 million on translation of the debt to sterling at the statement of financial position date has been recognised in the hedging instruments reserve in shareholders equity.
This hedge was fully effective throughout the current and prior years.
There were no cash flow or fair value hedges designated in the year.
b Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting Certain derivatives either do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 or the option to hedge account has not been taken.
These are referred to below as non-hedge derivatives.
