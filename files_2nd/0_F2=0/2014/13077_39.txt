Financial Statements 2 operating Segments The Executive Committee is the Groups Chief Operating Decision-Maker CODM.
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Executive Committee for the purposes of making strategic decisions and assessing performance.
The Executive Committee considers the business principally from a geographical perspective, but with Food being managed separately given the significantly different nature of these businesses and the associated risks and rewards.
The Groups geographical segments comprise Europe and North America ENA : Latin America, North Asia and South East Asia and Australia and New Zealand LAPAC : and Russia and CIS, Middle East, North Africa, Turkey and sub-Saharan Africa RUMEA.
The geographical segments derive their revenue primarily from the manufacture and sale of branded products in the health, hygiene and home categories.
Food derives its revenue from food products primarily sold in ENA.
The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on net revenue from external customers and adjusted operating profit.
Intercompany transactions between operating segments are eliminated.
Finance income and expense are not allocated to segments, as they are managed on a central Group basis.
As discussed in note 27, on 23 December 2014, the Group demerged the pharmaceutical business from the remainder of the Group.
RB Pharmaceuticals has therefore been classified as a discontinued operation.
As a result of this reclassification, the Group has restated the information below to better reflect the results from its operating segments, excluding RB Pharmaceuticals.
This restatement involved reallocating central costs previously allocated to RB Pharmaceuticals, which are expected to remain with the Group after the demerger of RB Pharmaceuticals.
Comparative information has also been restated to reflect this reallocation of central costs.

The net revenue from external customers reported on a geographical basis above is measured consistently with that in the operating segments.

The Groups customer base is diverse with no single external customer accounting for more than 10% of net revenue, and the top ten customers accounting for less than a quarter of net revenue.
