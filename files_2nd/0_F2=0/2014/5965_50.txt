Fidessa group plc 79 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 21 Financial risk management The use of financial instruments is managed under policies and procedures approved by the Board.
These policies are designed to reduce the financial risks being faced, which primarily relate to credit, interest, liquidity and currency risks, and arise in the normal course of business.
Credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose Fidessa to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
The largest customer accounts for no more than 5% of revenue and the 10 largest customers account for less than 30% of revenue.
Cash equivalents are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria as specified in Fidessas treasury policy.
The policy limits the maximum deposit with a counterparty and the maximum duration of a deposit.
The trade receivables as at 31st December are aged as in the table below.
2014 2013 000 000 Not due 42,334 41,244 Not more than three months past due 10,583 15,566 More than three months but not more than six months past due 1,206 4,620 More than six months past due 1,761 1,855 Total trade receivables 55,884 63,285 Material trade receivable balances relate to sales transactions with financial institutions.
Credit to customers is provided in the normal course of business and the amount that appears in the balance sheet is net of an allowance for specific doubtful receivables, the allowance generally being due to concerns regarding a customers solvency or the age of a receivable.
In most situations where a receivable is aged but no specific allowance has been made for it, no revenue has been taken and it forms part of the deferred revenue balance.
Collateral is not required in respect of financial assets.
Allowances are made when the settlement of a receivable becomes doubtful and the potential exposure is not covered by a related amount in deferred revenue.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables is in the table below.

Trade payables Accrued expenses 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 3 months or less 3,829 5,097 28,891 27,846 3 to 12 months 208 129 1,594 1,135 Greater than one year 346 625 Carrying value 4,037 5,226 30,831 29,606 It is expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis will not arise materially earlier or at significantly different values.
Interest receivable and payable Fidessa holds net funds and hence its interest risks are associated with short-term cash deposits.
The overall objective with respect to these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of the funds, accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice, this means that deposits are unlikely to be made with a maturity date greater than three months.
All deposits are at current market rates.
There are no borrowings due to the cash reserves and strong cash generation of the business.
Foreign currency risk Fidessa operates internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and on the translation of the balance sheet and income statement of foreign operations into sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars and yen.
Revenue is split 51% in US dollars, 33% in sterling, 5% in yen, 5% in euros, 4% in Canadian dollars and 2% in other currencies.
The trade debtor currency exposure is consistent with the split of revenue by currency.
In managing currency risks the aim is to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the cash inflows and outflows in a foreign currency.
There are both cash inflows and outflows in these currencies that create a high level of natural hedge.
Hedging contracts have not been entered into for cash positions denominated in foreign currencies.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in foreign exchange would have an impact on consolidation of foreign subsidiaries earnings.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of sterling against other currencies would have decreased the profit before tax by approximately 197,000 for the year ended 31st December 2014 2013: 236,000.
