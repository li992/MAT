strateGic report Governance Financial statements year iN revieW performance resources and strategy and priorities business model marketplace risks relationships investment company balance sheet investments The significant level of realisations during the year has resulted in the balance sheet investment portfolio reducing to 1,914m at 31 March 2014.
The full or partial realisation of 28 of the Groups assets, including 12 of the top 20, has left a well funded balance sheet to meet the demands of a growing business.
The expansion of our product suite will place additional demands on our capital to seed new funds.
In addition, the Groups expanding footprint means that we are undertaking more regulated activities which also place demands on our capital.
The impact of the realisations is illustrated in the investment portfolio bridge below: 1,914 m At 1 April 2013 2,696 m New and follow on investments 393 Accrued interest income 133 Realisations 1,121 Impairments 112 Balance sheet FX and other 75 investment portfolio At 31 March 2014 1,914 Realisation include the return of 757.4m of principal and the crystallisation of 226.4m of rolled up interest and 137.4m of realised capital gains.
Investments in the period comprise 181.1m of capital invested in our credit and real estate funds and 212.4m co-investment alongside our mezzanine funds for new and follow on investments.
New investments in the period include Euro Cater, Vitaldent and Mec3 in Europe, and Cura in Australia.
The Sterling value of the portfolio decreased by 77.8m due to foreign exchange movements.
The portfolio is 69% Euro denominated and 12% US dollar denominated.
Sterling denominated assets only account for 10% of the portfolio.

This is in part due to the Group retaining its minority equity position in assets it has otherwise been refinanced out.
It is also reflective of the Group undertaking more sponsorless transactions requiring it to invest more in non interest bearing equity.
