Accounting policies Interests in joint arrangements A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control: that is, when the relevant activities that significantly affect the investees returns require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Joint arrangements are either joint operations or joint ventures.
Joint operations A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement or that other facts and circumstances indicate that this is the case.
The Groups share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows are combined with the equivalent items in the financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Groups interest in a jointly controlled entity is accounted for in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary.
Joint ventures A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
At the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the joint venture is recognised as goodwill.
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.

Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Groups interest in that joint venture are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
