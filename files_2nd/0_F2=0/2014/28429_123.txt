238 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C8:  C8.1 Deferredtax The statement of financial position contains the following deferred tax assets and liabilities in relation to: Deferredtaxassets  2014 m 2013 m 2014 m 2013 m Unrealised losses or gains on investments 83 315 1,697 1,450 Balances relating to investment and insurance contracts 4 8 499 451 Short-term temporary differences 2,607 2,050 2,065 1,861 Capital allowances 9 10 30 16 Unused deferred tax losses 62 29 Total 2,765 2,412 4,291 3,778 The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2014 and 2013 arises in the following parts of the Group: 2014 m 2013 m Asia insurance operations 84 55 US insurance operations 2,343 2,042 UK insurance operations SAIF 1 PAC with-profits fund including non-profit annuity business 71 82 Other 61 59 Other operations 206 173 Total 2,765 2,412 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable, that is to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
The table that follows provides a breakdown of the recognised deferred tax assets set out in the table above for both the short-term temporary differences and unused tax losses split by business unit.
The table also shows the period of estimated recoverability for each respective business unit.
For these and each category of deferred tax asset recognised their recoverability against forecast taxable profits is not significantly impacted by any current proposed changes to future accounting standards.

The distinction between temporary differences that arise from items of either a trading or capital nature may affect the recognition of deferred tax assets.
Accordingly, for the 2014 full year results and financial position at 31 December 2014 the possible tax benefit of approximately 110 million 2013: 127 million, which may arise from capital losses valued at approximately 0.5 billion 2013: 0.6 billion, is sufficiently uncertain that it has not been recognised.
In addition, a potential deferred tax asset of 47 million 2013: 61 million, which may arise from trading tax losses and other potential temporary differences totalling 0.2 billion 2013: 0.4 billion is sufficiently uncertain that it has not been recognised.
Of these, losses of 32 million will expire within the next seven years.
Of the remaining losses 1 million will expire within 20 years and the rest have no expiry date.
Under IAS 12, Income Taxes, deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
C8.2 Currenttax Of the 117 million 2013: 244 million current tax recoverable, the majority is expected to be recovered in one year or less.
The current tax liability increased to 617 million 2013: 395 million reflecting the increase in shareholder profits.
