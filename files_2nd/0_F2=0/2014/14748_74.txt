The most financially significant risks are likely to be: Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets under perform this yield, this will create a deficit.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by and increase in the value of the Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation Risk The majority of the benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life Expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members, so increase in the life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
