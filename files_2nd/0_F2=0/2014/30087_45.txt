FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11 Financial Instruments Risk management policies and procedures The Group invests in equities and other instruments for the long term in the pursuit of the Investment Objective set out on page 25.
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction or an increase in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
The principal risks the Group faces in its portfolio management activities are: l Market risk comprising price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk l Liquidity risk l Credit risk The Managers policies and processes for managing these risks are summarised on pages 27 to 28 and have been applied throughout the year.
11.1 Market Price Risk By the very nature of its activities, the Groups investments are exposed to market price fluctuations.
Management of the risk The Manager runs a diversified portfolio and reports to the Board on the portfolio activity and performance at each board meeting.
The Board monitors the investment activity and strategy to ensure it is compatible with the stated objectives.
The Groups exposure to changes in market prices on its quoted equity investments and investment property portfolio, was as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Investments held at fair value 880,483 739,486 Concentration of exposure to price risks As set out in the Investment Policies on page 25, there are guidelines to the amount of exposure to a single company, geographical region or direct property.
These guidelines ensure an appropriate spread of exposure to individual or sector price risks.
As an investment company dedicated to investment in the property sector, the Group is exposed to price movements across the property asset class as a whole.
Price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the value of shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair values of the Groups equity, CFD and direct property investments.
The level of change is consistent with the illustration shown in the previous year.
The sensitivity is based on the Groups equity, CFD and direct property exposure at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk The Board receives a report at each board meeting on the proportion of the investment portfolio held in Sterling, Euros or other currencies.
The Group may sometimes hedge foreign currency movements outside the Eurozone by funding investments in overseas securities with unsecured loans denominated in the same currency or through forward currency contracts.
Cash deposits are held in Sterling and or Euro denominated accounts.

Property companies usually have borrowings themselves and the level of gearing and structure of its debt portfolio is a key factor when assessing the investment in a property company.
The Group has fixed and variable rate borrowings.
The interest rate on the debenture loan is fixed, details are set out in note 13.
In addition to the debenture the Group has unsecured, multi-currency revolving loan facilities which carry variable rates of interest based on the currencies drawn, plus a margin.
The Manager considers both the level of debt on the balance sheet of the Group i. e. the debenture and any bank loans drawn and the see-through gearing, taking into account the assets and liabilities of the underlying investments, when considering the investment portfolio.
These gearing levels are reported regularly to the Board.
The majority of the Groups investment portfolio is non-interest bearing.
As a result the Groups financial assets are not directly subject to significant amounts of risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 March of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: l floating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set l fixed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due to be repaid.
The Groups exposure to floating interest rates on assets is 9,740,000 2013: 13,666,000.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on assets is 8,197,000 2013: 942,000.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on liabilities is 15,000,000 2013: 15,000,000.
The Groups exposure to floating interest rates on liabilities is 61,000,000 2013: 42,000,000.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: l Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a marg in over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2013: same l Interest paid on borrowings under the multi-currency loan facilities, is at a marg in over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent for the type of loan l T he finance charge on the debenture stock was at an interest rate of 11.83% 2013: 11.82%.
The year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between floating and fixed interest rates changes.
The exposure at 31 March of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: Interest rate sensitivity A change of 2% on interest rates at the reporting date would have had the following direct impact: 2014 2014 2013 2013 2% 2% 2% 2% Increase Decrease Increase Decrease 000 000 000 000 Change to shareholders funds 789 789 431 431 Change to total earnings per Ordinary share 0.25 p 0.25p 0.14 p 0.14p This level of change is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes throughout the period.
This assessment does not take into account the impact of interest rate changes on the market value of the investments the Group holds.
66 TR Property Investment Trust FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11 Financial Instruments continued 11.4 Liquidity Risk Unquoted investments in the portfolio are subject to liquidity risk.
The Group held two unquoted investments at the year end see 11.6 below.
In certain market conditions, the liquidity of direct property investments may be reduced.
At 31 March 2014, 8% of the Groups investment portfolio was held in direct property investments.
At March 2014, 92% of the Groups investment portfolio is held in listed securities which are predominantly readily realisable.
The debenture loan of 15m is repayable in 2016.
Bank loan facilities are short term revolving loans which it is intended are renewed or replaced but renewal cannot be certain.
The table below shows the timing of cash outflows to settle the Groups current drawn debt facilities together with anticipated interest costs.

48m was drawn on this facility at the balance sheet date.
Management of the risk The Manager sets guidelines for the maximum exposure of the portfolio to unquoted and direct property investments.
These are set out in the Investment Policies on page 25.
All unquoted investments and direct property investments with a value over 1 million must be approved by the Board for purchase.
The Company maintains regular contact with the banks providing revolving facilities and renewal discussions commence well ahead of facility renewal dates.
In addition the Company is exploring new opportunities for the provision of debt on an ongoing basis.
11.5 Credit Risk The failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Group suffering a loss.
At the period end the largest counterparty risk, which the Group was exposed to was within Securities and properties sold for future settlement, where the largest single brokers balance was 921,000.
