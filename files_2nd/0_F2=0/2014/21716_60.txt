In the event of a return of capital on a winding-up or otherwise, Shareholders are entitled to participate in the distribution of capital after paying all the debts and satisfying all the liabilities attributable to the relevant share class.
The holders of shares of the relevant share class shall be entitled to receive by way of capital any surplus assets of the share class in proportion to their holdings.
In the event that the share class has insufficient funds or assets to meet all the debt and liabilities attributable to that share class, any such shortfall shall be paid out of funds or assets attributable to the other share classes in proportion to the respective net assets of the relevant share classes as at the date of winding-up.
Pursuant to Section 276 of the Law, a share in the Company confers on the shareholder the right to vote on resolutions of the Company, the right to an equal share in dividends authorised by the board of directors, and the right to an equal share in the distribution of the surplus assets of the Company.
11 DISCOUNT MANAGEMENT PROVISION The Companys Articles incorporate a discount management provision which applies to each class of Ordinary Shares individually that will require a continuation vote to be proposed in respect of the particular class of Ordinary Shares at a class meeting of the relevant shareholders by way of ordinary resolution if, over the previous 12 month rolling period commencing from 1 January 2008, the relevant class of Ordinary Shares has traded, on average calculated by averaging the closing mid-market share price on the dates which are 5 Business Days after the date on which each estimated Published NAV announcement is made for each NAV Calculation date over the period at a discount in excess of 5 per cent to the average net asset value per Ordinary Share of that class calculated by averaging the NAV per Ordinary Share of that class as at the NAV Calculation Date at the end of each month during the period.
In the event that a vote to continue is proposed and passed for any class of Ordinary Shares as a result of the operation of such mechanism, no further continuation vote will be capable of being proposed for that class for a further 12 months from the date of the passing of the continuation resolution.
