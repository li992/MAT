The utilisation of the disposal closure provision relates to ongoing costs incurred subsequent to the decision in 2013 to dispose of its insurance distribution business and close its SIP business.
The additional provision provided for in 2014 relates to the additional costs that will be incurred as part of the disposal of its occupational health business.
The provision is expected to unwind over 2 years.
Asset Services settlements relate to two matters: 1.
The potential costs in resolving a claim by those investors who did not choose to accept the Arch Cru Payment Scheme established in 2011.
The Payment Scheme has had an 87% acceptance rate.
The potential costs in resolving matters relating to a fund, of which CFM was the Operator until September 2009, when it was replaced by an unrelated company as Operator following which CFM had no further involvement with the fund.
The fund went into liquidation in 2012 and its liquidator has brought a claim against both former Operators.
Giving due consideration to these claims, the Group has made a provision of 24.8m at 31 December 2014 2013: 0.7m.
During the year, the Group has incurred 4.3m in respect of professional fees in relation to these matters.
The claims are expected to unwind within one year.
The insurance provision is made in relation to the Groups Professional Indemnity, Motor and Employee Liability exposures.
The Group makes provision when a claim has been made where it is more probable than not that an insured loss will occur.
These provisions are reassessed regularly to ensure that the level of provisioning is consistent with the claims that have been reported.
In the year, the Group has settled a number of insurance liabilities which it had provided for in previous years.
Additionally, it has made provision for new claims and increased or decreased existing provisions where more information on the progress of the claim has become available.
The Group's exposure is also mitigated by having in place a number of large insurance underwriters.
Within the property provisions there is included a discounted provision for the difference between the market value of the property leases acquired in 2011 with Ventura and Vertex Private Sector and the lease obligations committed to at the date the leases were signed by the previous owners.
This is in accordance with IFRS 3 revised which requires the use of fair value measurement.
The remaining property provision is made on a discounted basis for the future rent expense and related cost of leasehold property net of estimated sub-lease income where the space is vacant or currently not planned to be used for ongoing operations.
The expectation is that this expenditure will be incurred over the remaining periods of the leases which range from 1 to 24 years.
Other relates to provisions in respect of potential claims arising due to the nature of some of the operations that the Group provides.
These are likely to unwind over a period of 1 to 3 years.
