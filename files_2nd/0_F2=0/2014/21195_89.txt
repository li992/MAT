Loans at fair value Fair values have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using appropriate current interest rates for each portfolio of mortgages.
Further details of the fair value methodology are given in note 23.
The change in fair value of these loans during the year, attributable to a change in credit risk, was 361 million loss 2013: 43 million loss.
This amount has been determined as the amount that is not attributable to changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk.
The cumulative change attributable to changes in credit risk to 31 December 2014 was 3,070 million loss 2013: 2,709 million loss.
Non-securitised mortgage loans include 4.6 billion 2013: 4.1 billion relating to UK primary healthcare and PFI businesses which are secured against General Practitioner premises, other primary health-related premises or other emergency services related premises.
For all such loans, government support is provided through either direct funding or reimbursement of rental payments to the tenants to meet income service and provide for the debt to be reduced substantially over the term of the loan.
Although the loan principal is not , the nature of these businesses and premises provides considerable comfort of an ongoing business model and low risk of default.
Loans at amortised cost The fair value of these loans at 31 December 2014 was 4,240 million 2013: 5,334 million.

The obligation to repay this collateral is included in payables and other financial liabilities note 51.
The Group holds collateral in respect of loans where it is considered appropriate in order to reduce the risk of non-recovery.
This collateral generally takes the form of liens or charges over properties and, in the case of policy loans, the underlying policy for the majority of the loan balances above.
In all other situations, the collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.
