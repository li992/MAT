Recognition of deferred tax assets on enactment of MRRT and PRRT extension legislation in Australia: The Australian Minerals Resource Rent Tax MRRT and Petroleum Resource Rent Tax PRRT extension legislation was enacted in March 2012. under the legislation, the Group is entitled to a deduction against future MRRT and PRRT liabilities based on the market value of its coal, iron ore and petroleum assets.
A deferred tax asset, and an associated net income tax benefit of uS$637 million, was recognised in the year ended 30 June 2012 to reflect the future deductibility of these market values for MRRT and PRRT purposes, to the extent they were considered recoverable.

Other deductible temporary differences At 30 June 2014, the Group had deductible temporary differences for which deferred tax assets of uS$3,395 million 2013: uS$3,350 million have not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.

Onshore US The goodwill of uS$3,591 million that arose from the acquisition of Petrohawk Energy Corporation in 2011 has been allocated to the Onshore uS group of CGus which comprises the Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, Haynesville and Fayetteville CGus.
During the period, the Group disposed its interest in South Midland within the Permian Basin.
Goodwill of uS$23 million was allocated to South Midland to calculate the loss on disposal.
Accordingly, goodwill allocated to the Onshore uS group of CGus is uS$3,568 million.
The Onshore uS group of CGus comprises the natural gas and liquid reserves and resources, production wells and associated infrastructure including gathering systems and processing facilities in the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and the Permian areas in Texas and Louisiana uS and the Fayetteville area in Arkansas uS.
The Onshore uS group of CGus is part of the Petroleum and Potash reportable segment.
The Onshore uS group of CGus was tested for impairment after testing each of the individual CGus that it comprises.
The recoverable amount of the Onshore uS group of CGus was determined based on fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD.
FVLCD was determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expressed in real terms expected to arise from the continued use of the assets life of asset, including any expansion prospects, and its eventual disposal, using assumptions that an independent market participant may take into account.
These cash flows were discounted using a real after tax discount rate that reflected current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGu.
The determination of FVLCD was most sensitive to the following assumptions: Production volumes Crude oil prices Natural gas prices Discount rate Production volumes estimated production volumes were based on detailed data for the fields and took into account development plans for the fields established by management as part of the long-term planning process.
Production volumes are dependent on variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, the production costs, the contractual duration of the production leases and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced.
As each producing field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of the fields were computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions established by management.
The production profiles used were consistent with the resource volumes approved as part of the Groups process for the estimation of proved reserves and total resources.
246 BHP BILLITON ANNuAL REPORT 2014 6 7 8 9 Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information 14 Intangible assets continued Crude oil and natural gas prices key assumptions for oil and gas prices were derived from forward price curves and long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources.
These prices were adjusted to arrive at appropriate consistent price assumptions for different qualities of oil and gas, or where appropriate, contracted oil and gas prices were applied.
The crude oil and natural gas prices used in the FVLCD determinations were either lower or within the following range of prices published by market commentators: 2014 2013 Crude oil price uS$ bbl 88.00 107.79 71.00 125.00 Natural gas price uS$ MMBtu 3.84 5.84 4.45 6.51 Discount rate in arriving at the FVLCD, a real post-tax discount rate of 6.0 per cent 2013: 5.9 per cent was applied to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.
This discount rate was derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC, with appropriate adjustments made to reflect the risks specific to the CGu.
Year ended 30 June 2014 The impairment tests for the individual Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, Haynesville and Fayetteville CGus indicated that no impairments or reversal of prior impairments were required.
The impairment test of the Onshore uS group of CGus indicated that the recoverable amount of the Onshore uS group of CGus exceeded its carrying amount by uS$598 million and no impairment was required.
The table below shows the key assumptions used in the FVLCD as well as the amount by which each key assumption must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of the Onshore uS group of CGus, including goodwill.
Owing to the complexity of the analysis caused by relationships between each key assumption, such that a change in one would cause a change in several other inputs to the calculation, the analysis below was performed for each assumption individually.
Change required for the carrying amount to equal Assumptions used in FVLCD the recoverable amount Production volumes Managements long-term plan decrease of 1.2% Crude oil prices uS$ bbl 79.42 92.83 decrease of 5.1% Natural gas prices uS$ MMBtu 4.07 5.57 decrease of 3.5% Discount rate 6.0% increase of 20 basis points Year ended 30 June 2013 The impairment tests for the individual Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Fayetteville CGus indicated that no impairments were required.
However, an impairment of uS$266 million was recognised in relation to the Permian Basin.
In the prior year, the Permian Basin had been identified as one CGu.
However, the current development plan identifies two distinct regions that would have to be developed independently: North Reeves Pecos region Delaware Basin and South Midland Midland Basin region.
Management also noted that each region has a separate and distinctive basin: they are geographically distant: and they do not share common infrastructure.
Accordingly, management determined that each region represents a separate CGu.
The uS$266 million impairment relates to the South Midland CGu and was recognised against property, plant and equipment.
Refer to note 3 Exceptional items for further discussion.
The impairment test of the Onshore uS group of CGus was therefore performed after the Permian assets were written down to their recoverable amount which was based on FVLCD measured using discounted cash flow projections.
The result indicated that the recoverable amount of the Onshore uS group of CGus exceeded its carrying amount including goodwill by uS$4,104 million and no further impairment was required.
Change required for the carrying amount to equal Assumptions used in FVLCD the recoverable amount Production volumes Managements long-term plan decrease of 7% Crude oil prices uS$ bbl 82.50 91.54 decrease of 23% Natural gas prices uS$ MMBtu 4.14 5.66 decrease of 18% Discount rate 5.9% increase of 160 basis points Other Goodwill held by other CGus is uS$466 million 2013: uS$514 million, representing less than one per cent of net assets at 30 June 2014 2013: less than one per cent.
The goodwill has been allocated across a number of CGus in different reportable segments, with no CGu accounting for more than uS$200 million of total goodwill.

b Actual or potential litigation, including tax-related amounts, predominantly relate to a number of actions against the Group, none of which are individually significant and where the liability is not probable and therefore the Group has not provided for such amounts in these financial statements.
Additionally, there are a number of legal claims or potential claims against the Group, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen at present, and for which no amounts have been included in the table above.
In addition to the amounts reported above, following requests for information in August 2009 from the uS Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, the Group commenced an internal investigation and disclosed to relevant authorities evidence that it has uncovered regarding possible violations of applicable anti-corruption laws involving interactions with government officials.
The issues relate primarily to matters in connection with previously terminated exploration and development efforts, as well as hospitality provided as part of the Companys sponsorship of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
As has been publicly reported, the Australian Federal Police has indicated that it has commenced an investigation and the Group continues to fully cooperate with the relevant authorities.
In light of the continuing nature of the investigations it is not appropriate at this stage for BHP Billiton to predict outcomes and therefore no amount has been included in the contingent liabilities above.

c The ownership interest at the Groups and the associates or joint ventures reporting dates are the same.
When the annual financial reporting date is different to the Groups, financial information is obtained as at 30 June in order to report on an annual basis consistent with the Groups reporting date.
d Voting in relation to relevant activities, determined to be the approval of the operating and capital budgets, does not require unanimous consent of all participants to the arrangement, therefore joint control does not exist.
Instead, because the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policies of the investee, these investments are accounted for as associates.
e Richards Bay Minerals comprises two legal entities, Richards Bay Mining Proprietary Limited and Richards Bay Titanium Proprietary Limited, in each of which the Group had a 50 per cent interest and which function as a single economic entity.
After deducting non-controlling interests in subsidiaries of Richards Bay Minerals, the Groups effective interest in the operations of Richards Bay Minerals was 37.76 per cent up to the date of its effective disposal on 3 September 2012.

BHP BILLITON ANNuAL REPORT 2014 265 7 Financial Statements continued 29 Financial risk management Financial risk management strategy The financial risks arising from the Groups operations comprise market, liquidity and credit risk.
These risks arise in the normal course of business, and the Group manages its exposure to them in accordance with the Groups portfolio risk management strategy.
The objective of the strategy is to support the delivery of the Groups financial targets while protecting its future financial security and flexibility by taking advantage of the natural diversification provided by the scale, diversity and flexibility of the Groups operations and activities.
A Cash Flow at Risk CFaR framework is used to measure the aggregate and diversified impact of financial risks upon the Groups financial targets.
The principal measurement of risk is CFaR measured on a portfolio basis, which is defined as the worst expected loss relative to projected business plan cash flows over a one-year horizon under normal market conditions at a confidence level of 95 per cent.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it to market risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices.
under the strategy outlined above, the Group seeks to achieve financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices on a floating or index basis.
This strategy gives rise to a risk of variability in earnings which is measured under the CFaR framework.
In executing the strategy, financial instruments are potentially employed in three distinct but related activities.
The following table summarises these activities and the key risk management processes: Activity Key risk management processes 1 Risk mitigation On an exception basis, hedging for the purposes of mitigating risk related Execution of transactions within approved mandates.

exposure to the index target.
Where debt is issued in a currency other than the uS dollar and or at a fixed interest rate, fair value and cash flow hedges may be executed to align the debt exposure with the Groups functional currency of uS dollars and or to swap to a floating interest rate.
As part of this strategy swaptions may also be used.
3 Strategic financial transactions Opportunistic transactions may be executed with financial instruments to capture Exposures managed within value at risk and stop loss limits.
value from perceived market over under valuations.
Execution of transactions within approved mandates.
Primary responsibility for identification and control of financial risks, including authorising and monitoring the use of financial instruments for the above activities and stipulating policy thereon, rests with the Financial Risk Management Committee under authority delegated by the Group Management Committee.
266 BHP BILLITON ANNuAL REPORT 2014 6 7 8 9 Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information 29 Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair value of fixed interest rate financial instruments.
Interest rate risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
The majority of the Groups debt is raised under central borrowing programs.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to convert most of the centrally managed debt into uS dollar floating interest rate exposures.
As at 30 June 2014, the Group holds uS$3,319 million 2013: uS$5,377 million of centrally managed fixed interest rate borrowings as well as uS$2,018 million 2013: uS$3,533 million of other fixed interest rate borrowings that have not been swapped to floating interest rates, arising from debt raised during the financial year ended 30 June 2014, debt assumed as part of the acquisition of Petrohawk Energy Corporation and debt raised prior to the DLC merger.
The Groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating interest rate component of the Groups net borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in hedge relationships used to hedge both interest rate and foreign currency risks are as follows: Fair value 2014 2013 US$M uS$M Interest rate swaps US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Not later than one year 12 36 Later than one year but not later than two years 114 14 Later than two years but not later than five years 202 307 Later than five years 60 56 US dollar swaps Pay fixed receive floating Not later than one year 1 Later than one year but not later than two years 3 Later than two years but not later than five years 8 15 Later than five years 198 365 Australian dollar swaps Pay fixed receive floating Later than two years but not later than five years 2 Cross currency interest rate swaps UK pound sterling to US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Later than five years 7 136 UK pound sterling to US dollar swaps Pay fixed receive fixed Later than five years 131 22 Australian dollar to US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Later than two years but not later than five years 80 117 Canadian dollar to US dollar swaps Pay fixed receive fixed Later than five years 36 31 Euro to US dollar swaps Pay floating receive fixed Not later than one year 27 Later than two years but not later than five years 169 Later than five years 327 33 Euro to US dollar swaps Pay fixed receive fixed Later than one year but not later than two years 20 Later than two years but not later than five years 45 Later than five years 89 16 Swaptions Pay floating receive fixed Not later than one year 173 Total fair value of derivatives 1,210 236 Based on the net debt position as at 30 June 2014, taking into account interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps and swaptions, it is estimated that a one percentage point increase in the uS LIBOR interest rate will decrease the Groups equity and profit after taxation by uS$126 million 2013: decrease of uS$128 million.
This assumes that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and the fixed floating mix and balances are constant over the year.
However, interest rates and the net debt profile of the Group may not remain constant over the coming financial year and therefore such sensitivity analysis should be used with care.
BHP BILLITON ANNuAL REPORT 2014 267 7 Financial Statements continued 29 Financial risk management continued Currency risk The uS dollar is the functional currency of most operations within the Group and as a result currency exposures arise from transactions and balances in currencies other than the uS dollar.
The Groups potential currency exposures comprise: translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items: and transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues.
The Groups foreign currency risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items Monetary items, including financial assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are periodically restated to uS dollar equivalents, and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement.
The exception is foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency denominated provisions for closure and rehabilitation at operating sites, which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment.
The following table shows the foreign currency risk arising from financial assets and liabilities, which are denominated in currencies other than the uS dollar: 2014 2013 Net financial liabilities assets by currency of denomination US$M uS$M Australian dollars 4,684 4,104 Chilean peso 267 113 South African rand 62 251 Other 56 109 Total 4,945 3,631 The principal non-functional currencies to which the Group is exposed are the Australian dollar, Chilean peso and South African rand.
Based on the Groups net financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2014, a weakening of the uS dollar against these currencies as illustrated in the table below, with all other variables held constant, would decrease increase profit after taxation and equity as follows: 2014 2013 US$M uS$M Profit after Profit after Currency movement taxation Equity taxation Equity 1 cent movement in Australian dollar 31 31 27 27 10 pesos movement in Chilean peso 3 3 1 1 0.2 rand movement in South African rand 3 1 2 3 The Groups financial asset and liability profile may not remain constant and therefore these sensitivities should be used with care.
Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues Certain operating and capital expenditure is incurred by some operations in currencies other than their functional currency.
To a lesser extent, certain sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations, and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
These currency risks are managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
When required under this strategy the Group enters into forward exchange contracts.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding to manage short-term foreign currency cash flows relating to operating activities is an asset of uS$ nil and a liability of uS$ nil 2013: an asset of uS$1 million and a liability of uS$1 million.
268 BHP BILLITON ANNuAL REPORT 2014 6 7 8 9 Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information 29 Financial risk management continued Commodity price risk Contracts for the sale and physical delivery of commodities are executed whenever possible on a pricing basis intended to achieve a relevant index target.
Where pricing terms deviate from the index, derivative commodity contracts may be used when available to return realised prices to the index.
Contracts for the physical delivery of commodities are not typically financial instruments and are carried in the balance sheet at cost typically at nil : they are therefore excluded from the fair value and sensitivity tables below.
Accordingly, the financial instrument exposures set out in the tables below do not represent all of the commodity price risks managed according to the Groups objectives.
Movements in the fair value of contracts included in the tables below are offset by movements in the fair value of the physical contracts, however only the former movement is recognised in the Groups income statement prior to settlement.
The risk associated with commodity prices is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Financial instruments with commodity price risk included in the following tables are those entered into for the following activities: economic hedging of prices realised on commodity contracts as described above: purchases and sales of physical contracts that can be cash-settled: and derivatives embedded within other supply contracts.
All such instruments are carried in the balance sheet at fair value.

BHP BILLITON ANNuAL REPORT 2014 269 7 Financial Statements continued 29 Financial risk management continued Provisionally priced commodity sales contracts Not included in the above tables are provisionally priced sales volumes for which price finalisation, referenced to the relevant index, is outstanding at the reporting date.
Provisional pricing mechanisms embedded within these sales arrangements have the character of a commodity derivative and are carried at fair value through profit and loss as part of trade receivables.
The Groups exposure at 30 June 2014 to the impact of movements in commodity prices upon provisionally invoiced sales volumes is set out in the following table: 2014 2013 Impact on equity Impact on equity and profit after and profit after taxation of 10% taxation of 10% Net exposure increase in Net exposure increase in receive market price receive market price Units of exposure deliver US$M deliver uS$M Copper Tonnes 000s 350 246 329 155 Zinc Tonnes 000s 11 2 7 1 Lead Tonnes 000s 29 6 59 12 Gold Ounce 19,401 2 8,976 1 Silver Ounce 000s 5,072 10 8,340 15 Nickel Tonnes 000s 3 5 6 8 Iron Ore Tonnes 000s 588 5 The sensitivities in the above tables have been determined as the absolute impact on fair value of a 10 per cent increase in commodity prices at each reporting date, while holding all other variables, including foreign currency and exchange rates, constant.
The relationship between commodity prices and foreign currencies is complex and movements in foreign exchange rates can impact commodity prices.
The sensitivities should therefore be used with care.
Liquidity risk The Groups liquidity risk arises from the possibility that it may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due and is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Operational, capital and regulatory requirements are considered in the management of liquidity risk, in conjunction with short-term and long-term forecast information.
Additional liquidity risk arises on debt related derivatives due to the possibility that a market for derivatives might not exist in some circumstances.
To counter this risk the Group only uses derivatives in highly liquid markets.
The Groups strong credit profile, diversified funding sources and committed credit facilities ensure that sufficient liquid funds are maintained to meet its daily cash requirements.
The Groups policy on counterparty credit exposure ensures that only counterparties of a high credit standing are used for the investment of any excess cash.
During the year ended 30 June 2014, Moodys Investors Service made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A1 the short-term credit rating is P-1.
Standard & Poors made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A the short-term credit rating is A-1.
There were no defaults on loans payable during the period.
Standby arrangements and unused credit facilities Details of major standby and support arrangements are as follows: Facility Facility available Used Unused available used unused 2014 2014 2014 2013 2013 2013 US$M US$M US$M uS$M uS$M uS$M a Commercial paper program 6,000 6,000 6,000 1,330 4,670 Total financing facilities 6,000 6,000 6,000 1,330 4,670 a The Group has a uS$6.0 billion commercial paper program backed by uS$6.0 billion of revolving credit facilities.
In May 2014 the uS$5.0 billion and uS$1.0 billion revolving credit facilities expiring in December 2015 and December 2014 were replaced by a uS$6.0 billion revolving credit facility.
The new facility has a five-year maturity with two one-year extension options.
The facility is used for general corporate purposes and as backup for the commercial paper programs.
The interest rates under these facilities are based on an interbank rate plus a margin.
The applicable margin is typical for a credit facility extended to a company with the Groups credit rating.
The Group had uS$ nil uS commercial paper outstanding in the market at the end of the financial year 2013: uS$1.3 billion.

BHP BILLITON ANNuAL REPORT 2014 271 7 Financial Statements continued 29 Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk arises from the non-performance by counterparties of their contractual financial obligations towards the Group.
To manage credit risk the Group maintains Group-wide procedures covering the application for credit approvals, granting and renewal of counterparty limits and daily monitoring of exposures against these limits.
As part of these processes, the financial viability of all counterparties is regularly monitored and assessed.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the total carrying amount of relevant financial assets on the balance sheet as at the reporting date.
The Groups credit risk exposures are categorised under the following headings: Counterparties The Group conducts transactions with the following major types of counterparties: Receivables counterparties Approximately half of sales to the Groups customers are made on open terms.
Payment guarantee counterparties Approximately half of sales to the Groups customers occur via secured payment mechanisms.
Derivative counterparties Counterparties to derivative contracts consist of a diverse number of financial institutions and industrial counterparties in the relevant markets.
Cash investment counterparties As part of managing cash flow and liquidity, the Group holds short-term cash investments with a range of approved financial institutions.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty or group of counterparties.
Geographic The Group trades in all major geographic regions.
Countries in which the Group has a significant credit risk exposure include South Africa, Australia, the united States, Japan and Singapore.
Where appropriate, secured payment mechanisms and other risk mitigation instruments are used to protect revenues from credit risk losses.
Industry In line with our asset portfolio, the Group sells into a diverse range of industries and customer sectors.
This diversity means that the Group is not materially exposed to any individual industry or customer.

These terms and conditions are determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the customers credit quality and prevailing market conditions.
Receivables that are classified as past due in the above tables are those that have not been settled within the terms and conditions that have been agreed with that customer.
For an analysis of movements in impaired trade receivables, refer to note 10 Trade and other receivables.
The credit quality of the Groups customers is monitored on an ongoing basis and assessed for impairment where indicators of such impairment exist.
The solvency of each debtor and their ability to repay the receivable is considered in assessing receivables for impairment.
In certain circumstances the Group may seek collateral as security for the receivable.
Where receivables have been impaired, the Group actively seeks to recover the amounts in question and enforce compliance with credit terms.
No other financial assets were past due or impaired at 30 June 2014 30 June 2013: nil.

274 BHP BILLITON ANNuAL REPORT 2014 6 7 8 9 Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information 29 Financial risk management continued Valuation hierarchy The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is principally calculated with reference to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Groups views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates.
The inputs used in fair value calculations are determined by the relevant Group Function.
Our Group Functions support the Businesses and operate under a defined set of accountabilities authorised by the Group Management Committee.
Movements in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities may be recognised through the income statement or in other comprehensive income.

The Group will invest capital in assets where they fit its strategy.
The Groups priorities for cash flow are: reinvestment in projects that carry attractive rates of return regardless of the economic climate: commitment to a solid A credit rating: and returning excess capital to shareholders firstly with its progressive dividend policy and thereafter via capital management initiatives for example share buy-backs.
Further information relevant to the actions and outcomes of the Groups capital management strategy is contained in section 7.1.

These contributions are expensed as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Group has closed all defined benefit schemes to new entrants.
Defined benefit pension schemes remain operating in Australia, the uS, Canada, South America, Europe and South Africa for existing members.
Full actuarial valuations are prepared and updated annually to 30 June by local actuaries for all schemes.
The Projected unit Credit valuation method is used.
The Group operates final salary schemes that provide final salary benefits only, non-salary related schemes that provide flat dollar benefits and mixed benefit schemes that consist of a final salary defined benefit portion and a defined contribution portion.
Defined benefit post-retirement medical schemes The Group operates a number of post-retirement medical schemes in the uS, Canada, Europe and South Africa.
Full actuarial valuations are prepared by local actuaries for all schemes.
All of the post-retirement medical schemes in the Group are unfunded.
The Groups defined benefit pension schemes and post-retirement medical schemes expose the Group to a number of risks: Risk Description Volatility in The Group is exposed to changes in the value of assets held in funded pension schemes to meet future benefit payments.
asset values uncertainty in The cost to the Group of meeting future benefit obligations will depend on the value of the benefits paid in the future.
benefit payments To the extent these payments are dependent on future experience, there is some uncertainty.
Some of the schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation or to salaries, and some schemes provide benefits that are paid for the life of the member.
If future experience varies from the assumptions used to value these obligations, the cost of meeting the obligations will vary.
uncertainty in future Movement in the value of benefit obligations and scheme assets will impact the contributions that the Group funding requirements will be required to make to the schemes in the future.
In many cases, pension schemes are managed under trust, and the Group does not have full control over the rate of funding or investment policy for scheme assets.
In addition, the Group is exposed to changes in the regulations applicable to benefit schemes.
Recognising this, the Group has adopted an approach of moving away from providing defined benefit pensions.
The majority of Group sponsored defined benefit pension schemes have been closed to new entrants for many years.
Existing benefit schemes, and the terms of employee participation in these schemes, are reviewed on a regular basis.
The Group follows a coordinated strategy for the funding and investment of its defined benefit pension schemes subject to meeting all local requirements.
The Groups aim is for the value of defined benefit scheme assets to be maintained at close to the value of the corresponding benefit obligations, allowing for some short-term volatility.
The following tables set out details of the Groups defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical schemes.

b Property is the only asset class that does not have a quoted market price in an active market.
c Scheme assets classified as Other as at 30 June 2014 primarily comprise insured annuities in South Africa and Canada.
The fair value of scheme assets includes no amounts relating to any of the Groups own financial instruments or any of the property occupied by or other assets used by the Group.
Scheme assets are invested in a diversified range of asset classes, predominantly comprising bonds and equities.
In some locations, scheme trustees and other bodies have legal responsibility for the investment of scheme assets, and decisions on investment strategy are taken in consultation with the Group.
The Group monitors its exposure to changes in equity markets, interest rates and inflation, and measures its balance sheet pension risk using a risk-based approach.
Asset-liability studies are carried out periodically for the major pension schemes and the suitability of investment strategies for all defined benefit pension schemes are also reviewed periodically.
The Groups aim is to progressively shift defined benefit pension scheme assets towards investments that match the anticipated profile of the benefit obligations, as funding levels improve, and as benefit obligations mature.
Over time, this is expected to result in a further reduction in the total exposure of pension scheme assets to equity markets.
For pension schemes that pay lifetime benefits, the Group may consider and support the purchase of annuities to back these benefit obligations if it is commercially sensible to do so.

The estimated sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to each significant assumption shown below has been determined at an individual scheme level if each assumption were changed in isolation.
In practice, the schemes are subject to multiple external experience items which may vary the defined benefit obligation over time.
The methods and assumptions used in preparing these sensitivity results remain consistent with those used in previous reporting periods.
The estimated effects of variations in the principal actuarial assumptions on the Groups defined benefit obligation at the reporting date are as follows: Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation Defined benefit Post-retirement pension schemes medical schemes US$M US$M Discount rate Increase of 1% 89 48 Decrease of 1% 105 59 Future salary increases Increase of 1% 18 n a Decrease of 1% 17 n a Mortality Increase in life expectancy at age 65 of 1 year 20 17 Decrease in life expectancy at age 65 of 1 year 20 16 Medical cost trend rate initial and ultimate Increase of 1% n a 52 Decrease of 1% n a 42 31 Key management personnel Key management personnel compensation comprises: 2014 2013 2012 US$ uS$ uS$ Short-term employee benefits 29,302,029 24,959,049 19,889,528 Post-employment benefits 3,176,079 3,446,910 3,586,477 Share-based payments 21,300,632 26,297,032 26,645,312 Total 53,778,740 54,702,991 50,121,317 Transactions with key management personnel During the financial year, there were no purchases from the Group 2013: uS$ nil: 2012: uS$ nil.

282 BHP BILLITON ANNuAL REPORT 2014 6 7 8 9 Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information 33 Employee share ownership plans Awards were provided under the following employee share ownership plans for the year ended 30 June 2014: the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Group Incentive Scheme GIS, Management Award Plan MAP, Group Short Term Incentive Plan GSTIP, Transitional GMC awards, the all-employee share plan, Shareplus and the Kgatelo Pele Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP.
These awards take the form of rights to receive ordinary shares in either BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc.
Awards made are subject to performance hurdles LTIP and Transitional GMC and service conditions all plans.
Subject to the performance conditions and service conditions being met and the extent to which they are met, the awards will vest and the participant will become entitled to the appropriate number of ordinary shares or, if relevant, entitled to exercise options over the relevant number of ordinary shares.
Awards under the plans do not confer any rights to participate in a share issue: however, there is discretion under each of the plans to adjust the awards in response to a variation of BHP Billitons share capital.
All awards issued prior to 1 July 2011 are eligible to receive a payment equal to the dividend amount that would have been earned on the underlying shares awarded to those participants the Dividend Equivalent Payment.
The Dividend Equivalent Payment is made to the participants once the underlying shares are issued or transferred to them.
No Dividend Equivalent Payment is made in respect of awards that lapse.
Awards issued after 1 July 2011 under GSTIP and MAP are no longer eligible to receive the Dividend Equivalent Payment.
A description of these plans is as follows: i GIS and GSTIP The GIS is a plan for the GMC and the GSTIP is a plan for management employees other than the GMC being first introduced during the year ended 30 June 2009.
The GIS and GSTIP awards are split equally between a cash award being a percentage of base salary and a grant of rights to receive BHP Billiton shares.
The rights are subject to a two-year vesting period before they vest or can be exercised.
If, during the vesting period, an individual resigns without the Remuneration Committees consent, or is dismissed for cause, their rights are forfeited.
Awards in respect of the year ended 30 June 2014 will be awarded during the year ending 30 June 2015. ii LTIP and MAP The LTIP is a plan for the GMC.
The LTIP awards are awarded annually.
The performance hurdle applicable to the awards requires the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR over a five-year performance period to be greater than a combination of the Peer Group TSR being the weighted median TSR where the comparator group is a specified group of peer companies and, for awards from December 2010 onwards, the Index TSR being the index value where the comparator group is a market index such as the MSCI World.
To the extent that the performance hurdle is not achieved, awards are forfeited.
For awards to vest in full, the Groups TSR must exceed the Peer Group TSR and Index TSR if applicable by a specified percentage per year, determined for each grant by the Remuneration Committee.
Since the establishment of the LTIP in 2004, this percentage has been set at 5.5 per cent per year.
The vesting scale is determined for each grant by the Committee.
The MAP is a plan for management employees other than the GMC.
under the MAP, participants receive an award of rights to receive BHP Billiton shares.
The number of rights is determined by role, performance and organisational level.
There are no performance conditions attached to the awards and awards will vest at the end of three years providing participants remain in employment over that time.
iii Transitional GMC awards As the MAP awards that are allocated to individuals in their non-GMC management positions have a three-year service condition and the LTIP awards provided to GMC members have a five-year service and performance condition, as a transitional step, the Committee may determine that new GMC members recruited from within BHP Billiton receive Transitional GMC awards to bridge the gap between the two programs.
Transitional GMC awards have two tranches.
Tranche one has a three-year service and performance condition.
Tranche two has a four-year service and performance condition.
The Remuneration Committee has absolute discretion to determine if the performance condition has been met and whether any, all or part of the award will vest or otherwise lapse, having regard to but not limited to BHP Billitons TSR over the threeor four-year performance period respectively, the participants contribution to Group outcomes and the participants personal performance with guidance on this assessment from the CEO.
No Dividend Equivalent Payment is payable on these awards.
iv Shareplus Shareplus, an all-employee share purchase plan, commenced in April 2007.
Employees may contribute up to uS$5,000 to acquire shares Acquired Shares in any Plan year.
On the third anniversary of the start of a Plan year, the Company will match the number of Acquired Shares held by the employee at that time with Matched Shares.
The employees have no beneficial entitlement to the Matched Shares until they are awarded.
Acquired Shares are purchased on a quarterly basis.
Employees can sell their Acquired Shares at any time.
If, prior to the third anniversary, an individual sells their Acquired Shares, resigns without the Remuneration Committees consent or is dismissed for cause, their entitlement to Matched Shares is forfeited.
v Kgatelo Pele ESOP The Kgatelo Pele ESOP commenced in June 2013 with a three-year vesting period.
All eligible employees are entitled to awards to the value of ZAR8,667 each year, with the last tranche to be granted in June 2015.
Beneficiaries must be permanently employed by Hotazel Manganese Mines Pty Ltd as at 1 May effective date of each year to qualify for the allocation for that particular year.
Hotazel Manganese Mines Pty Ltd will contribute the necessary amount to the Kgatelo Pele Trust by way of donation to enable the purchase of shares, which will be held until the end of the vesting period.
During this period, beneficiaries will be entitled to dividends declared by BHP Billiton.
At the end of each vesting period, eligible employees will be given the opportunity to create a portfolio by having the shares transferred into their own names or to sell their entitlements and receive the cash benefit.

BHP BILLITON ANNuAL REPORT 2014 291 7 Financial Statements continued 36 Subsequent events Proposed demerger of assets The Group announced on 19 August 2014 that it plans to demerge a selection of its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets to create an independent metals and mining company.
This includes BHP Billitons interests in its integrated Aluminium business, Manganese business and the Cerro Matoso nickel operation, Energy Coal South Africa, Illawarra metallurgical coal and the Cannington silver-lead-zinc mine.
It is intended that the new company would be listed on the Australian Securities Exchange with a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
A final Board decision will only be made once the necessary government, taxation, regulatory and other third party approvals are secured on satisfactory terms.
Once the necessary approvals are in place, shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on the proposed demerger.
As numerous steps are required to enable the demerger to proceed, the relevant businesses have not been classified as held for sale or distribution as at 30 June 2014.
Subject to final Board approval to proceed, shareholder approval and the receipt of satisfactory third party approvals, the demerger is expected to be completed in the first half of the 2015 calendar year.
Summarised financial information as at 30 June 2014 and for the year ended 30 June 2014 of the businesses included in the proposed demerger is provided below: 2014 US$M Current assets 2,860 Non-current assets 14,619 Current liabilities 1,897 Non-current liabilities 3,950 Net assets 11,632 Attributable to non-controlling interests 867 Attributable to members of BHP Billiton Group 10,765 Revenue 10,444 Depreciation and amortisation 1,303 Profit before interest and taxation 764 Net operating cash inflows 1,658 Net investing cash outflows 700 Transaction costs incurred 45 The demerger will be recognised as a reduction in equity at the fair value of the shares in the demerged company distributed to shareholders.
A gain or loss will arise on the difference between the fair value of those shares and the net assets of the demerged businesses determined at the date of the demerger, which will include the fair value step-up on the Manganese business described below, less any transaction costs.
Transaction costs will mainly comprise stamp duty, professional fees and separation and establishment costs.
In contemplation of the proposed demerger, BHP Billiton and Anglo American have agreed to make certain changes to the agreement which governs their interests in the Manganese business.
BHP Billiton manages and owns 60 per cent of the Manganese business with Anglo American owning the remaining 40 per cent.
Subject to obtaining the required approvals for the agreement, the changes will result in BHP Billiton and Anglo American agreeing to share joint control of the Manganese business.
BHP Billiton will discontinue consolidation of the Manganese business and account for its 60 per cent interest as an equity accounted joint venture.
BHP Billiton will therefore derecognise the existing carrying amounts of all assets, liabilities and the non-controlling interest in the Manganese business attributed to Anglo American and initially record its retained 60 per cent interest at fair value.
The remeasurement at fair value will give rise to an estimated gain of approximately uS$2 billion.
Repeal of Minerals Resource Rent Tax MRRT On 2 September 2014, legislation to repeal the MRRT in Australia received the support of both Houses of Parliament.
The repeal will take effect at a later date to be fixed by proclamation and therefore the MRRT will continue to apply until that date.
At 30 June 2014, the Group carried an MRRT deferred tax asset net of income tax consequences of uS$698 million.
Subject to determination of the effective date, an income tax charge approximating this amount is expected to be recognised in the 2015 financial year.
Other than the matters outlined above, no matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of the financial year that have significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations, results of operations or state of affairs of the Group in subsequent accounting periods.

316 BHP BILLITON ANNuAL REPORT 2014 6 7 8 9 Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information Standardised measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves Standardised measure The purpose of this disclosure is to provide data with respect to the estimated future net cash flows from future production of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas.
The Standardised measure is based on the Groups estimated proved reserves as presented in section 2.3.
1 Petroleum reserves and this data should be read in conjunction with that disclosure, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this section.
The Standardised measure is prepared on a basis which presumes that year-end economic and operating conditions will continue over the periods in which year-end proved reserves would be produced.
The effects of future inflation, future changes in exchange rates, expected future changes in technology, taxes, operating practices and any regulatory changes have not been included.
The Standardised measure is prepared by projecting the estimated future annual production of proved reserves owned at period end and pricing that future production to derive future cash inflows.
Estimates of future cash flows for 2014, 2013 and 2012 are computed using the average first day of the month price during the 12-month period.
Future price increases for all periods presented are considered only to the extent that they are provided by fixed and determinable contractual arrangements in effect at year-end and are not dependent upon future inflation or exchange rate changes.
Future cash inflows for all periods presented are then reduced by future costs of producing and developing the year-end proved reserves based on costs in effect at year-end without regard to future inflation or changes in technology or operating practices.
Future development costs include the costs of drilling and equipping development wells and construction of platforms and production facilities to gain access to proved reserves owned at year-end.
They also include future costs, net of residual salvage value, associated with the abandonment of wells, dismantling of production platforms and rehabilitation of drilling sites.
Future cash inflows are further reduced by future income taxes based on tax rates in effect at year-end and after considering the future deductions and credits applicable to proved properties owned at year-end.
The resultant annual future net cash flows after deductions of operating costs including resource rent taxes, development costs and income taxes are discounted at 10 per cent per annum to derive the Standardised measure.
There are many important variables, assumptions and imprecisions inherent in developing the Standardised measure, the most important of which are the level of proved reserves and the rate of production thereof.
The Standardised measure is not an estimate of the fair market value of the Groups oil and gas reserves.
An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, anticipated future changes in prices, costs and exchange rates, anticipated future changes in secondary tax and income tax rates and alternative discount factors representing the time value of money and adjustments for risks inherent in producing oil and gas.

The beginning of the year and end of the year totals are shown after reduction for income taxes and these, together with the changes in income tax amounts, are shown as discounted amounts at 10 per cent per annum.

The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the respective year, regardless of when drilling was initiated.
Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned.
An exploratory well is a well drilled to find oil or gas in a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir.
A development well is a well drilled within the limits of a known oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
A productive well is an exploratory, development or extension well that is not a dry well.
A dry well hole is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.
Oil and gas properties, wells, operations and acreage The following tables show the number of gross and net productive crude oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage as at 30 June 2014.
A gross well or acre is one in which a working interest is owned, while a net well or acre exists when the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells or acres equals one.
Productive wells are producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production.
Developed acreage is comprised of leased acres that are within an area by or assignable to a productive well.
undeveloped acreage is comprised of leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether such acres contain proved reserves.
