Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials Notes to the consolidated financialstatements 1 Significant accounting policies General information Just Retirement Group plc the Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 13 June 2013 as a public company limited by shares.
The Companys registered office is Vale House, Roebuck Close, Bancroft Road, Reigate, Surrey, RH2 7RU.
On incorporation, the share capital of the Company was 2 divided into 20 ordinary shares of 10 pence each.
During the year to 30 June 2014, the Company acquired a 100% shareholding in Just Retirement Group Holdings Limited JRGHL as part of a reorganisation of the Group and successfully completed the issue of new ordinary shares to raise approximately 300m through a Premium Listing on the London Stock Exchange on 15 November 2013.
Further details of these transactions are included in note 20.
1.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union effective for accounting periods commencing on or before 1 July 2013 and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements also comply with the revised Statement of Recommended Practice issued by the Association of British Insurers ABI SORP in December 2005 as amended in December 2006 insofar as these requirements do not contradict IFRSrequirements.
The Group in its current structure was formed prior to admission on the London Stock Exchange when the Company acquired JRGHL.
As described in note 20, the Group undertook a reorganisation during the year to insert a new holding company above the existing parent.
Whilst the reorganisation did not meet the definition of a business combination, the Group has applied the principles of reverse acquisition accounting in IFRS 3 to account for the insertion of the new holding company.
As a result, the financial statements are presented as a continuation of the JRGHL Group.
The Group has adopted the following new accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards as of 1 July 2013: IFRS 13, Fair value measurement effective 1 January 2013 the standard provides a single source of guidance on how fair value is measured.
There is no effect on the values previously recorded in the financial statements.
IFRS 13 also requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement which are set out in note 15: Amendments to IFRS 7, Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities effective 1 January 2013 the amendments require disclosure about rights to offset financial instruments and related arrangements in order to provide users with information that is useful in evaluating the effect of netting arrangements on the Groups financial position.
The amendments do not impact these financial statements: and Annual improvements 2011 effective 1 January 2013 include improvements to IFRS 1, First time adoption: IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements: IAS 16, Property, plant and equipment: IAS 32, Financial instruments presentation: and IAS 34, Interim financial reporting.
The improvements clarify existing guidance and have no impact on these financial statements.
The following amendments to existing standards in issue, but not yet effective, have been early adopted by the Group: Amendment to IAS 36, Impairment of assets, on recoverable amount disclosures effective 1 January 2014 the amendments clarify disclosure requirements in respect of the recoverable amount of impaired non-financial assets if the amount is based on fair value less costs to sell.
These amendments have no significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The following new accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to existing accounting standards in issue, but not yet effective or endorsed by the EU, have not been early adopted by the Group.
Unless stated, the new and amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements: IFRS 9, Financial instruments: classification and measurement effective 1 January 2018, not yetendorsed.
IFRS 9 will replace IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
IFRS 9 has two measurement categories: amortised cost and fair value.
All equity instruments are measured at fair value.
A debt instrument is measured at amortised cost only if held to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent principal and interest.
For liabilities measured at fair value, the fair value change due to an entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements effective 1 January 2013, endorsed for annual periods commencing 1 January2014.
IFRS 10 builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 11, Joint arrangements effective 1 January 2013, endorsed for annual periods commencing 1 January2014.
IFRS 11 defines and establishes accounting principles for joint arrangements, replacing IAS 31, Interests in joint ventures.
The standard distinguishes between two types of joint arrangements joint ventures and joint operations, based on how rights and obligations are shared by the parties to the arrangement.
IFRS 12, Disclosures of interests in other entities effective 1 January 2013, endorsed for annual periods commencing 1 January2014.
IFRS 12 provides disclosure requirements for subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 77 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued IFRS 14, Regulatory deferral accounts effective 1 January 2016, not yetendorsed.
IFRS 14 permits first-time adopters to continue to recognise amounts related to rate regulation in accordance with previous GAAPrequirements.
IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers effective 1 January 2017, not yet endorsed.
IFRS 15 specifies how and when an entity recognises revenue, providing a single, principles-based model to be applied to all contracts with customers, whilst requiring more informative and relevant disclosures.
Amendment to IAS 16, Property, plant and equipment, and IAS 38, Intangible assets, on depreciation and amortisation effective 1 January 2016, not yetendorsed.
Amendments to clarify that the use of revenue-based methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset or amortisation of an intangible asset is not appropriate because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the asset or intangible asset.
Amendment to IAS 19, Employee benefits effective 1 July 2014, not yetendorsed.

78 Just Retirement Group plc Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials 1 Significant accounting policies continued 1.2 Significant accounting policies and the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to select accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated statement of financial position, other primary statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The major areas of judgement used as part of accounting policy application are summarisedbelow: Accounting policy Item involving judgement Critical accounting judgement 1.11 a Classification of insurance and investment contracts Assessment of significance of insurance risk transferred.
1.10 a, b Financial assets and liabilities Classification of financial assets and liabilities, including assessment of market observability of valuation inputs.
All estimates are based on managements knowledge of current facts and circumstances, assumptions based on that knowledge and predictions of future events and actions.
Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.
The table below sets out those items the Group considers susceptible to changes in critical estimates and assumptions together with the relevant accounting policy: Accounting policy and notes Item involving estimates and assumptions Critical estimates and assumptions 1.11 b, 22 b, 23 b Measurement of insurance liabilities The critical estimates used in measuring insurance liabilities include the projected arising from writing annuity future annuity payments and the cost of maintaining the reserves.
insurancecontracts The key assumptions are the discount rates and mortality experience used in the valuation of future annuity payments.
The valuation discount rates are derived from yields on supporting assets after deducting allowances for default.
Mortality assumptions are derived from the appropriate standard mortality tables, adjusted to reflect the future mortality experience of the annuitants.
Further detail can be found in note 22.
1.12, 22 Measurement of reinsurance assets The critical estimates used in measuring the value of reinsurance assets include arising from reinsurance arrangements the projected future cash flows arising from reinsurers share of the Groups insurance liabilities.
The key assumptions used in the valuation include discount rates and mortality experience, as described above, and assumptions around the reassurers ability to meet its claim obligations.
1.10 b, 15 d Measurement of fair value of loans The critical estimates used in valuing loans secured by mortgages include the secured by mortgages projected future receipts of interest and loan repayments, future house prices, and the future costs of administering the loan portfolio.
The key assumptions used as part of the valuation calculation include future property prices and their volatility, mortality, and the rate of voluntary redemptions.
Further details can be found in note 15 a.
1.8, 13 Measurement of fair value of PVIF and The critical estimates used in the measurement of the present value of in-force other intangible assets business PVIF and other intangibles relate to the projected future cash flows that will flow to the Group from such assets.
The key assumptions used in such projections include valuation discount rates, mortality assumptions, house prices and future volatility, and voluntary redemption experience as detailed above, in addition to the expected useful economic lives of such assets.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 79 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued 1.3 Consolidation principles Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Group, directly or indirectly, has power to exercise control over financial and operating policies in order to gain economic benefits.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which effective control is transferred to the Group and are excluded from consolidation from the date of disposal.
All inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits on transactions between Group companies have been eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned on acquisition to ensure consistency with Grouppolicies.
The Group is required to use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
Under this method, the cost of acquisition ismeasured as the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration at date of acquisition and the amount of any non-controlling interest intheacquiree.
Asdescribed in note 20, the Group undertook a reorganisation during the period to insert a new holding company above the existing parent.
Whilst the reorganisation did not meet the definition of a business combination, the Group has applied the principles of reverse acquisition accounting in IFRS 3 to account for the insertion of a new holding company.
As a result, these financial statements are presented as a continuation of the JRGHL Group.
1.4 Operating profit The Group reports operating profit as an alternative measure of profit which the Group uses for decision making and performance measurement.
The operating profit represents a combination of both the profits generated from new business written in the period and profits expected to emerge from the in-force book of business, together with the actual operating experience where different from that assumed at the start of theperiod.
In addition, operating profit includes the impacts of changes to future operating assumptions applied in the period.
New business profits represent expected investment returns on financial instruments backing shareholder and policyholder funds after allowances for expected movements in liabilities and acquisition costs.
Profits arising from the in-force book of business represent the expected unwind of prudent reserves above best estimates for mortality, corporate bond defaults and, with respect to lifetime mortgages, no-negative guarantee andearly redemptions.
Operating profit excludes the impairment and amortisation of goodwill and other intangible assets, restructuring costs and other exceptional items.
Exceptional items are those items that, in the Directors view, are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their nature or incidence toenable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Variances between actual and expected investment returns due to economic and market changes are also disclosed outside operating profit.
1.5 Revenue recognition a Premium revenue Premium revenue in respect of single premium insurance contracts is accounted for when the premiums are received.
Facilitated adviser charges, which have arisen since 1 January 2013 following the implementation of the Retail Distribution Review RDR, are not accounted for within premium revenue, and do not represent a charge on the Group.
Reinsurance premiums payable in respect of reinsurance treaties are accounted for when the reinsurance premiums are due.
Reinsurance premiums previously incurred can be recaptured under certain conditions and the recapture can arise once reinsurance financing foran underwriting year is fully repaid.
b Investment income Investment income consists of interest receivable for the year, realised gains and losses, and unrealised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues.
Realised gains and losses on financial investments occur on the disposal or transfer of financial assets and represent the difference between the proceeds received, net of transaction costs, and the original cost.
Unrealised gains and losses arising on financial assets represent the difference between the carrying value at the year end and the carrying value at the previous year end or purchase value during the year.
c Other operating income Other operating income, which consists of fee income for initial advances made on loans secured by mortgages, administration fees and commission, are recognised when receivable.
In addition, operating income includes fees from software licensing which are recognised across the license period.
1.6 Expense recognition a Claims paid Annuity claims are recorded when each annuity instalment becomes due for payment.
Reinsurance paid claim recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the relatedclaim.
b Investment expenses and charges Investment expenses, comprising fund managers and transaction costs, are recognised on an accruals basis.
80 Just Retirement Group plc Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials 1 Significant accounting policies continued 1.6 Expense recognition continued c Finance costs Finance costs on deposits received from reinsurers are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Interest on loan notes isaccrued in accordance with the terms of the loan noteagreement.
d Employee benefits Defined contribution plans The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds managed by a third party.
Obligations for contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme are recognised as an expense in profit orlossasincurred.
Share-based payment transactions Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at grant date, determined using stochastic and scenario-based modelling techniques where appropriate.
The fair value is expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity, based on the Groups estimate of the equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest as a result of changes in non-market based vesting conditions, and recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates in the income statement over the remaining vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Where a leaver is entitled to their scheme benefits, this is treated as an acceleration of the vesting in the period they leave.
Where a scheme is modified before it vests, any change in fair value as a result of the modification is recognised over the remaining vesting period.
Where a scheme is cancelled, this is treated as an acceleration in the period of the vesting of allremainingoptions.
e Operating leases Payments made under operating leases, net of any investments received from the lessor, are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of thelease.
1.7 Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of the costs of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary and represents the future economic benefit arising from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised.
Goodwill is not amortised, but assessed for impairment annually or when circumstances or events indicate there may be uncertainty over the carrying value.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference isrecognised directly in the incomestatement.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units and an impairment is recognised where the carrying value of the cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss and are not reversed.
1.8 Intangible assets Intangible assets consist primarily of contractual relationships such as PVIF, distribution networks, brand, intellectual property and unique softwareproducts created and controlled by the Group.
Intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that the relevant future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group, and are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairments.
Theintangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which ranges from three to 16 years.
The useful lives are determined by considering relevant factors, such as usage of the asset, potential obsolescence, competitive position and stability of the industry.
For intangibles with finite useful lives, impairment testing is performed where there is an indication that the carrying value of the assets may besubject to an impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the methods used to determine the cost of intangibles acquired in a business combination are asfollows: Intangible asset Estimated useful economic life Valuation method PVIF 16 years Estimated value in-force using IFRS European Embedded Valuemodel Brand Five years Estimated royalty stream if the rights were to be licensed Distribution network Three years Estimated discounted cash flow Software Three years Estimated replacement cost Intangible assets acquired by the Group, including internal software development costs, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are capitalised and recognised as an intangible asset.
Direct costs include the software development teams employee costs.
All other costs associated with researching or maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense asincurred.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 81 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued 1.9 Equipment Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method to write down the cost to residual value over their estimated useful lives as follows: Computer equipment fouryears Furniture and fittings twoyears 1.10 Financial assets and liabilities a Classification The Group classifies financial investments in accordance with IAS 39 whereby, subject to specific criteria, they are accounted for under one of the followingcategories: Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss these comprise assets and liabilities designated by management as fair value through profit and loss on inception and derivatives that are held for trading.
These investments are measured at fair value with all changes thereon being recognised in investment income in the income statement.
Deposits from reinsurers deposits are measured and valued in accordance with the reinsurance contracts, which takes into account an appropriate discount rate for the timing of expected cash flows.
b Use of fair value The Group uses current bid prices to value its investments with quoted prices.
Actively traded investments without quoted prices are valued using prices provided by third parties.
If there is no active established market for an investment, the Group applies an appropriate valuation technique such as discounted cash flow analysis.
Determining the fair value of financial investments when the markets are not active The Group holds certain financial investments for which the markets are not active.
These comprise financial investments which are not quoted in active markets and include loans secured by mortgages, derivatives and other financial investments for which markets are not active.
When the markets are not active, there is generally no or limited observable market data to account for financial investments at fair value.
The determination of whether an active market exists for a financial investment requires managements judgement.
If the market for a financial investment of the Group is not active, the fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
The Group establishes fair value for these financial investments by using quotations from independent third parties or internally developed pricing models.
The valuation technique is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The valuation techniques include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analysis.
The valuation techniques may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates and, for loans secured by mortgages, mortality, future expenses, voluntary redemptions and house price assumptions.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables impact the reported fair value of these financial instruments positively or negatively.
The financial investments measured at fair value are classified into the following three level hierarchy on the basis of the lowest level of inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement of the financial investment concerned: Level 1: Quoted price unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: Significant inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
c Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The Groups policy is to derecognise financial assets when it is deemed that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
1.11 Insurance and investment contracts a Classification of insurance and investment contracts The measurement basis of assets and liabilities arising from life and pensions business contracts is dependent upon the classification of those contracts as either insurance or investment contracts.
A contract is classified as insurance only if it transfers significant insurance risk.
Insurance risk is significant if an insured event could cause an insurer to pay significant additional benefits to those payable if no insured event occurred.
Acontract that is classified as an insurance contract remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.
Fixed term annuity pension business is classified as an investment contract as there is no transfer of longevity risk due to the fixed term nature ofthe contract.
82 Just Retirement Group plc Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials 1 Significant accounting policies continued 1.11 Insurance and investment contracts continued b Measurement of insurance liabilities Insurance contracts Long-term insurance liabilities arise from the Group accepting annuity contracts, including defined benefit fide-risking solutions, and are measured by using estimates of projected future cash flows arising from annuity payments plus the costs of administering them.
Valuation of insurance liabilities is derived using discount rates, adjusted for default allowance, and mortality assumptions, taken from the appropriate mortality tables and adjusted to reflect actual and expected experience.
Liability adequacy test The Group performs adequacy testing on its insurance liabilities to ensure the carrying amount is sufficient to cover the current estimate of future cash flows.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement.
c Investment contracts Investment contracts are measured at fair value through profit and loss in accordance with IAS 39, in line with the Groups accounting policy with respect to financial assets and liabilities.
As such, investment contracts are valued using an internal model and determined on a policy-by-policy basis using a prospective valuation of future annuity benefit and expense cash flows, but with an adjustment to amortise any day-one gain over the life of the contract.
1.12 Reinsurance a Reinsurance assets Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a consistent manner with insurance liabilities and are classified as reinsurance assets.
Ifareinsurance asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced accordingly and that impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
b Financial liabilities Where reinsurance contracts entered into by the Group are structured to provide financing, with financing components to be repaid in future periods, such amounts are classified as reinsurance finance and included in financial liabilities in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
Where reinsurance contracts entered into by the Group require deposits received from reinsurers to be repaid, such amounts are classified as deposits received from reinsurers and included in financial liabilities in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
Deposits received from reinsurers are valued in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance contracts, which take into account an appropriate discount rate for the timing of expected cash flows.
c Amounts receivable payable Where reinsurance contracts the Group has entered into include longevity swap arrangements, such contracts are settled on a net basis and amounts receivable or payable from to the reinsurers are included in the appropriate heading under either receivable and other financial assets orinsurance and other payables.
1.13 Segments The Groups segmental results are analysed on a basis consistent with the way that the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM assesses the performance and allocation of resources.
The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Group ExecutiveCommittee.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incursexpenses.
The operating segments from which the Group derives revenues and incurs expenses are asfollows: The manufacture of insurance products for distribution to the ator in-retirement market, which is undertaken through the activities of the life company: The arranging of annuity contracts through a non-advised service, and providing intermediation, mortgage advice and arranging from a panel of lifetime mortgage products: and The provision of licensed software to financial advisers.
Operating segments, where certain materiality thresholds in relation to total results from operating segments are not exceeded, are combined when determining reportable segments.
For segmental reporting, the arranging of annuity contracts, providing intermediary mortgage advice and arranging, plus the provision of licensed software, is combined with the manufacturing of insurance products and reflected in the Groups insurance segment.
Other Group activities, such as capital and liquidity management, and investment activities, are reported within corporate activities.
1.14 Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently amortised through profit and loss over the period to maturity at the effective rate of interest required to recognise the discounted estimated cash flows to maturity.
1.15 Share capital The difference between the proceeds received on issue of the shares, net of share issue costs, and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Where the Company purchases shares for the purposes of employee incentive plans, the consideration paid, net of issue costs, is deducted from retained earnings.
Upon issue or sale any consideration received is credited to retained earnings net of related costs.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 83 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued 1.16 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with less than 90 days maturity from the date of acquisition.
1.17 Taxation The current tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date, and after any adjustments in respect of prior years.
Tax, including tax relief for losses if applicable, is allocated over profits before taxation and amounts charged or credited to components of other comprehensive income and equity as appropriate.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, using the liability method, on all material temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal temporary differences arise from the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities, including derivative contracts, technical provisions and other insurance items and tax losses carried forward.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
1.18 Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and  in foreign currencies are recognised in the incomestatement.

The interest payable on deposits received from reinsurers is calculated by reference to the gross redemption yield on the assetportfolio.
6 Segmental reporting A single reportable segment is disclosed separately as the insurance segment and comprises the activities of the following: The manufacture of insurance products for distribution to the ator in-retirement market, which is undertaken through the activities of the life company: The arranging of annuity contracts through a non-advised service, and providing intermediation, mortgage advising and arranging from a panel of lifetime mortgage products: and The provision of licensed software to financial advisers.
The reconciliation of the results of the operating segment for the income statement includes the results arising from the activities of the Groups management services and holding companies and eliminations on consolidation.
The Group operates in one geographical segment which is the UK.

This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
Taxation of life insurance companies was fundamentally changed following the publication of the Finance Act 2012.
From 1 January 2013, lifeinsurance tax is based on financial statements: prior to this date, the basis for profits chargeable to corporation tax was surplus arising withinthe Pillar 1 regulatoryregime.
Cumulative differences arising between the two bases, which represent the differences in retained profits and taxable surplus which are not excluded items for taxation, are brought back into the computation of taxable profits.
However, legislation provides for transitional arrangements whereby such differences are amortised on a straight-line basis over a 10-year period from 1 January 2013.
The tax charge for the period to 30June 2014 includes profits chargeable to corporation tax arising from this amortisation of 14.7m 2013: 7.4m.
8 Remuneration of Directors Information concerning individual Directors emoluments, interests and transactions is given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
For the purposes of the disclosure required by Schedule 5 to the Companies Act 2006, the total aggregate emoluments of the Directors in respect of 2014 was 1.8m.
Employer contributions to pensions for Executive Directors for qualifying periods were nil.
The aggregate net value of share awards granted to the Directors in the period was 2.5m.
The net value has been calculated by reference to the closing middle-market price of an ordinary share at the date of grant.
During the year, no share options were exercised by Directors.
With respect to the prior year, the Directors of JRGHL, who served during the year, were remunerated indirectly by Permira Funds other than the independent Non-executive Director whose remuneration of 60,000 was charged to Just Retirement Holdings Limited.
The JRGHL Group also incurred 250,000 in respect of fees for the services of two Directors who served during the year and was payable to Permira LLP.
9 Staff numbers and costs The average number of persons employed by the Group including Directors during the financial period, analysed by category, was asfollows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2014 2013 Number Number Directors 9 3 Senior management 57 52 Staff 768 726 Average number of staff 834 781 Annual Report & Accounts 2014 87 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued 9 Staff numbers and costs continued The aggregate personnel costs were as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2014 2013 m m Wages and salaries 50.6 43.3 Social security costs 5.7 4.7 Other pension costs 4.9 3.7 Total personnel costs 61.2 51.7 The Company does not have anyemployees.
10 Employee benefits Defined contribution pension scheme The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
The pension cost charge for the period represents contributions payable to the fund and amounted to 4.9m 2013: 3.7m.
Employee share plans Following Admission, the Group has implemented the following employee share plans: Long-term incentive plan LTIP The Group made awards under the LTIP to Executive Directors and other senior managers in November2013.
The aggregate value at the Offer Price of the shares underlying the initial LTIP Awards granted were 6,765,138, of which 6,505,138 was in respect of LTIP Awards subject to performance conditions and 260,000 was in respect of Restricted Share Units which are not subject to performance conditions, as described below.
50% of the initial LTIP Awards other than the Restricted Share Units are subject to a performance condition relating to the growth in the Groups operating profit over a performance period of three financial years.
If operating profit for the financial year ended 30 June 2016 exceeds operating profit for the financial year ended 30 June 2013 by 29.5% equivalent to 9% per annum cumulative growth, 20% of these LTIP Awards will vest.
The maximum 100% will vest if operating profit for the financial year ending 30 June 2016 exceeds operating profit for the financial year ended 30 June 2013 by at least 64.3% equivalent to 18% per annum cumulative growth.
Payment will be on a sliding scale in between these points.
None of these awards would be made if growth is below 29.5%.
The operating profit will be subject to any adjustments as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The remaining 50% of the initial LTIP Awards other than the Restricted Share Units are subject to a condition measuring the Companys TSRperformance relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts, mining companies and oil and gas producers over the performance period from Admission to 30 June 2016, where the initial TSR shall be determined by reference to the Offer Price.
Vesting of 25% of these LTIP Awards will occur for median performance and the maximum 100% will vest for upper quintile performance or above, with straight-line vesting in between these points.
None of these awards will vest if TSR is below themedian.
The awards are accounted for as equity-settled schemes.
The fair value of these schemes is calculated at each award date based upon the number of shares expected to vest and the expense charge is recognised over the course of the vestingperiod.
At 30 June 2014 there were 3,006,703 awards in issue and a charge of 307,580 has been recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding increase in equity in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
Share incentive plan SIP The SIP is an all-employee share ownership plan.
The Group made an award of 831,070 free shares immediately after admission to all eligible employees.
These shares will be forfeited if the employees cease employment except in good leaver circumstances within the first three years from the date of the award.
While shares are held in trust by the SIP Trust on behalf of the employees and subject to the SIP rules, the employee will be the beneficial owner of the shares and will be entitled to receive dividends subject to any reinvestment in dividend shares described below and, through the SIP Trust, to vote and to participate in substantially the same way as other shareholders.
Any shares held in the SIP Trust will rank equally with shares then in issue.
An employee may leave his or her shares in the SIP Trust until he ceases to be employed by the Group at which point he will be required to withdraw his shares from the SIP Trust.
These awards are accounted for as equity-settled schemes.
The fair value of these schemes is calculated at each award date based upon the number of shares awarded multiplied by the share price at grant date and expensed over the vesting period.
At 30 June 2014 there were 792,839 awards in issue and a charge of 321,103 has been recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding increase in equity in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
88 Just Retirement Group plc Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials 10 Employee benefits continued Deferred share bonus plan DSBP The DSBP is operated in conjunction with the Groups short-term incentive plan for Executive Directors and other senior managers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Awards under the DSBP bonus awards will usually be granted over shares with a market value of one-third or such other proportion as has been determined by the Remuneration Committee of any bonus payable to such employees under any of the Groups annual bonus arrangements, unless the Remuneration Committee decides otherwise.
Awards under the DSBP may be made in the formof: a a conditional right to acquire shares at no cost to the participant conditional award : b an option to acquire shares at no cost to the participant nil-cost option : or c a right to receive a cash amount which relates to the value of a certain number of notional shares cash award.
The share element of these bonus awards are accounted for as equity-settled schemes.
The fair value of the awards is calculated at each award date based on one-third of the estimated annual bonus payout and expensed over the vestingperiod.
Initial bonus awards will be made to Executive Directors and other senior managers in October 2014 in respect of bonuses earned in the financial year ended 30 June 2014.
Save As You Earn SAYE scheme In April 2014, the Group granted options over 4,261,320 ordinary shares with an exercise price of 121 pence over three years or five years, saving periods.
The number of options granted over the three years, and five years, saving periods were 3,180,312 and 1,081,008 respectively.
Neither the amount nor the saving period can be changed once the scheme commences.
At the end of the savings period all or part of the savings can be used to purchase JRG shares, or the savings can be returned in full.
The employee has a six-month period after the savings period to make a decision.
Employees can save any amount between 5 and 500 per month.
These options will be forfeited if the employees cease employment except in good leaver circumstances within these periods.
These options are accounted for as equity-settled schemes.
Therefore, the cost to the Group of the options vesting with respect to the service condition being met is not reflected in the fair value per option but the estimate of the number of options that will actually vest, which is trued-up at each reporting period and ultimately reflects the number of options that do actually vest.
At 30 June 2014 there were 4,245,921 options in issue and a charge of 86,165 has been recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding increase in the equity in the Consolidated statement of financial position.

For the purpose of the earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of shares for the comparative periods also reflect theexchange.
As explained in note 20, the Group introduced a number of new employee share plans following admission.
Awards under the DSBP had not been made at 30 June 2014.
12 Dividends No dividends were paid during the year ended 30 June 2014 2013: nil.
The Directors recommend a final dividend for 2014 of 2.2 pence per share.

90 Just Retirement Group plc Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials 13 Intangible assets continued Impairment testing Goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets at leastannually.
Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units or groups of cash generating units asfollows: 30 June 30 June 2014 2013 m m Just Retirement Limited 32.8 32.8 TOMAS Acquisitions Limited 0.8 Total goodwill 32.8 33.6 The recoverable amounts of goodwill have been determined from value in use.
The key assumptions of this calculation are notedbelow: 2014 Period on which management approved forecasts are based 5 years Discount rate Just Retirement Limited 12% Discount rate TOMAS Acquisitions Limited 30% The value in use of Just Retirement Limited is considered by reference to latest business plans over the next five years that assumes average growth in sales of 7%, and a stressed scenario that assumes no growth in sales for the next three years and discount rate of 20%.
The outcome of the impairment assessment under both scenarios is that the goodwill in respect of Just Retirement Limited is not impaired and that the value inuse is higher than the carrying value of goodwill.
The value in use of TOMAS Acquisitions Limited was considered by reference to the current years loss and the projected loss for the year end to June 2015.
The projected loss reflects the expected and prudent reductions in revenue as a result of the Budget announcement.
As these expectations do not support the carrying value of the goodwill balance of 0.8m it was written down to nil.
Any reasonable possible changes in assumption will not cause the carrying value of the goodwill to exceed the recoverable amounts.

The Groups financial assets are summarised by measurement category asfollows: 30 June 30 June 2014 2013 m m Fair value through profit or loss Loans secured by mortgages 2,749.4 2,081.2 Other financial investments 4,740.6 3,963.5 Total financial assets 7,490.0 6,044.7 All financial assets at fair value through the profit or loss are designated as such on initialrecognition.

Deposits with credit institutions with a carrying value of 29.2m 2013: 17.2m have been pledged as collateral in respect of the Groups derivative financial instruments.
Amounts pledged as collateral are deposited with the derivative counterparty.
Of the above financial investments, 4,146.2m 2013: 3,637.2m is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
a Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as awhole: Level 1 Inputs to Level 1 fair values are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument.
Level 2 inputs include thefollowing: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets: Quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which very little information is released publicly: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability: and Market corroborated inputs.
Where the Group uses broker asset manager quotes and no information as to observability of inputs is provided by the broker asset manager, theinvestments are classified asfollows: Where the broker asset manager price is validated by using internal models with market observable inputs and the values are similar, theinvestment is classified as Level 2: and In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker asset manager prices, or the observability of inputs used by brokers asset managers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.
The majority of the Groups debt securities held at fair value and financial derivatives are valued using independent pricing services or third-party broker quotes, and therefore classified as Level 2.
Level 3 Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same where an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability.
Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions as those that the market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities held at fair value which are valued using valuation techniques for which significant observable market data is not available and classified as Level 3 include loans secured by mortgages, private placement bonds, and investment contractliabilities.
The valuation of loans secured by mortgages is determined using an internal model which projects future cash flows expected to arise from each loan.
Future cash flows allow for assumptions relating to future expenses, future mortality experience, costs arising from no-negative equity guarantees and voluntary redemptions.
Net future cash flows are discounted at swap rates prevailing at the reporting period date.
The fair value is calculated by taking the difference between the transaction price for each loan and the value that is calculated at the transaction date using the model, deferring it and recognising it over the expected life of each loan.
The Level 3 bonds are mainly comprised of asset-backed securities.
Such securities are valued using discounted cash flow analyses using prudent assumptions based on the repayment of the underlying loan.
Investment contract liabilities are calculated on a policy-by-policy basis using a prospective valuation of future annuity benefits and expense cash flows, but with an adjustment to amortise any day-one gain over the life of the contract.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements as at 30 June 2014 2013: nil.

The assumptions are that the underlying loans supporting the securities are redeemed in the future in a similar profile to the existing redemptions on an average rate of 3% per annum, and that default levels on the underlying basis remain at the current level of the Groups bond portfolio.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity on profit before tax to changes in default assumptions and redemption profiles in respect of Level 3 debt securities is not material.
Loans secured by mortgages 30 June 30 June 2014 2013 m m Fair value 2,749.4 2,081.2 1 At cost 1,846.7 1,431.2 1 Includes advances and further advances, less redemptions.
Loans secured by mortgages are classified as fair value through profit or loss.
The loans are not expected to be recovered within 12 months of theStatement of financial position date because the loans are lifetime mortgages and significant levels of early redemption are not anticipated.
The change in fair value of loans secured by mortgages recognised in profit or loss during the period is a gain of 145.8m 2013: loss of 122.2m.
The following table shows the movement in the aggregate difference yet to be recognised in profit or loss between the fair value of loans secured by mortgages at initial recognition and the amount that would have been determined at that date using the valuation technique: Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2014 2013 m m At start of period 431.0 316.9 Amounts deferred in the period 178.6 143.5 Amounts recognised in profit or loss in the period 45.1 29.4 At end of period 564.5 431.0 Reconciliation of the opening and closing recorded amount of Level 3 loans secured by mortgages: Year ended Year ended 30June 30 June 2014 2013 Loans secured by mortgages m m At start of period 2,081.2 1,842.8 1 Total gains losses in profit or loss 274.9 32.7 Loans advanced 476.4 309.7 Redemptions 83.1 38.6 At end of period 2,749.4 2,081.2 1 All gains and losses are included in Net investment income in profit or loss.
Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the loans secured by mortgages All gains and losses arising from loans secured by mortgages are largely dependent on the term of the mortgage, which in turn is determined bythe longevity of the customer.
Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of loans secured by mortgages include the following: Maintenance expenses Assumptions for future policy expense levels are based on the Groups recent expense analyses.
The assumed future expense levels incorporate anannual inflation rate allowance of 3.9% 2013: 4.0%.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 95 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued 15 Financial assets continued d Level 3 financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value continued Mortality Mortality assumptions have been derived by reference to appropriate standard mortality tables.
These tables have been adjusted to reflect the expected future mortality experience of mortgage contract holders, taking into account the medical and lifestyle evidence collected during the sales process and the Groups assessment of how this experience will develop in the future.
This assessment takes into consideration relevant industry and population studies, published research materials, input from the Groups lead reinsurer and the managements own experience.
Property prices The value of a property at the date of valuation is calculated by taking the latest valuation for that property and indexing this value using the Nationwide quarterly index for the propertys region.
Voluntary redemptions Assumptions for future voluntary redemption levels are based on the Groups recent analyses and external benchmarking, and the assumed redemption rate for policies in their first year is 0.6% 2013: 0.8%.
Sensitivity analysis Changes to unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique could give rise to significant changes in the fair value of the assets.
The Group has estimated the impact on profit for the period in changes to these inputs as follows: Loans secured by mortgages valuation assumptions Maintenance Property Voluntary Net increase decrease in profit before tax m expenses Mortality prices redemptions 10% 5% 10% 10% 30 June 2014 0.6 2.8 5.0 2.7 30 June 2013 0.4 1.4 4.1 1.2 The sensitivity factors are applied via actuarial models.
The analysis has been prepared for a change in each variable with other assumptions remaining constant.
In reality such an occurrence is unlikely due to correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear and larger or smaller impacts cannot be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity factors take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed and may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analysis include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represents the Groups view of reasonably possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the assumption that there is a parallel shift in interest rates at all durations.
Investment contract liabilities Reconciliation of the opening and closing recorded amount of Level 3 investment contract liabilities: Year ended Year ended 30June 30 June 2014 2013 m m At start of period 130.4 61.5 Deposits received from policyholders 73.7 78.8 Payments made to policyholders 9.1 4.7 Change in contract liabilities recognised in profit or loss 2.4 5.2 At end of period 197.4 130.4 Principal assumption underlying the calculation of investment contract liabilities Maintenance expenses Assumptions for future policy expense levels are based on the Groups recent expense analyses.
The assumed future expense levels incorporate an annual inflation rate allowance of 4.2% 2013: 4.2%.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity on profit before tax to changes in maintenance expense assumptions in respect of investment contract liabilities is not material.
