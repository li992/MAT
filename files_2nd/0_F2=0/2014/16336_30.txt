102 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 19 Trade and other receivables continued Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group mitigates this risk of financial loss by only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Whilst the Group has elements of concentration of credit risk, with exposure to a number of large counter parties and customers, the customers are mainly government agencies or multi-national organisations with whom the Group has long term business relationships.
The Group has a small number of customers with individually significant amounts outstanding.
These customers are considered to have low credit risk.
As set out in note 36, the Oman Airport IT contract has been terminated.
Specific provisions, as set out above, have been recorded against the associated receivables balances.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and when appropriate action is taken to minimise the Groups credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements see note 23 net of any allowances for losses represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.

Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted unadjusted active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that includes inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of Ultras financial instruments have been assessed as Level 2.

Introduction 104 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Group maintains committed banking facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
The Groups banking facilities are provided by a small group of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland.
During the year there were two facilities in place: one provides 100 million of revolving credit and expires in December 2017 and a second, which was put in place in August 2014 to replace the previous 90 million facility, provides 200 million of revolving credit which expires in July 2019.
Both facilities are denominated in Sterling, US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and Euros and are used for balance sheet and operational needs.
A further 15 million overdraft is available for short-term working capital funding.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Interest was predominantly charged at 1.00% 2013: 1.45% over base or contracted rate.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had available 177,956,000 2013: 163,000,000 of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
The Group is strongly cash-generative and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally to fund short-term local working capital requirements.
Where additional funding is required, this is provided centrally through the Groups committed banking facilities.
The Group, through its Canadian subsidiary Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems UETCS, participates in two Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Further disclosure is provided in note 24.
In July 2011 the Group negotiated a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. which allowed the Group to issue loan notes up to a value of USD150 million and with a maturity date of up to 10 years.
USD10 million of loan notes were issued in 2011 with a maturity date of July 2018 and a further USD60 million of loan notes were issued in January 2012 with a maturity date of January 2019.
On 2 January 2014 the Group agreed an amendment to extend the private shelf agreement for a three year period.
Consequently loan notes can now be issued up until 2 January 2017.
The amendment also increased the size of the shelf agreement so USD125 million of notes remain available for issue.
As at 31 December 2014 USD125 million remained available under the shelf agreement.
The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities: Within 1 to 2 to Over 1 year 2 years 5 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 2014 Bank loans and overdrafts 1,563 1,563 125,971 - 129,097 Loan notes 1,615 1,615 48,045 - 51,275 Government loans --- 5,728 5,728 Trade payables 92,855 --- 92,855 Currency derivatives used for hedging 1,920 1,678 -- 3,598 Deferred consideration 3,459 2,234 415 - 6,108 Accruals 25,196 1,853 967 206 28,222 2013 Bank loans and overdrafts 496 496 27,736 - 28,728 Loan notes 1,525 1,525 10,510 36,386 49,946 Government loans --- 4,337 4,337 Finance leases 48 23 1- 72 Trade payables 85,709 --- 85,709 Currency derivatives used for hedging 777 169 56 44 1,046 Deferred consideration 11,593 --- 11,593 Accruals 26,396 1,262 775 296 28,729 Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 22 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Currency risk The Group uses currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency transaction risk.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars and Canadian dollars.
At 31 December 2014, the net fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately 756,000 2013: asset 6,487,000, comprising 2,842,000 assets 2013: 7,533,000 and 3,598,000 liabilities 2013: 1,046,000.

The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
Interest rate risk The Group has USD70 million of long term fixed rate debt with an interest rate of 3.60%.
This was entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The effective interest rates and repricing dates of the Groups financial assets and liabilities were as follows: Effective Within interest Total 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years rate 000 000 000 000 000 2014 Cash and cash equivalents 0.31% 41,259 41,259 --- Loan notes 3.60% 44,849 -- 44,849 - Unsecured bank loans 1.28% 120,177 -- 120,177 - Government loans 4.43% 5,728 --- 5,728 2013 Cash and cash equivalents 0.39% 30,570 30,570 --- Loan notes 3.60% 42,352 -- 6,050 36,302 Unsecured bank loans 1.84% 25,975 -- 25,975 - Government loans 4.43% 4,337 --- 4,337 Finance lease liabilities 4.89% 63 44 19 -- Market risk sensitivity analysis Interest rate risk During 2014 the Groups net borrowings were predominantly at floating interest rates.

Under the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative SADI, the Canadian Federal Government provides a long-term funding arrangement in respect of certain eligible research and development project costs.
Under this arrangement, up to $32m will be provided to UETCS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the period 2016 to 2030.
Up to $8m will be provided to UEMS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the period 2020 to 2033.
The benefit of the below market rate of interest has been calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loans and has been credited to profit in the year.
The fair value of the loans have been calculated using a market interest rate for a similar instrument applicable at the time the agreements were signed.
UETCS also participates in the Investissement Quebec IQ research and development programme, whereby IQ shares in the cost of research and development of certain specified new products.
Under this arrangement IQ will finance up to $14m of eligible costs associated with these specified projects.
This funding is repayable under a royalty arrangement over the period 2014 to 2021 if these products are successfully brought to market.
Royalties only become payable when sales of these products are made.
As there is no minimum repayment, funding received in respect of the IQ programme has been included in the income statement.
Amounts recognised in the financial statements in respect of these programmes were as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Fair value of SADI loan brought forward 4,337 2,914 Contributions 687 1,282 Interest charged to finance costs 823 539 Foreign exchange differences 119 398 Fair value of SADI loan carried forward 5,728 4,337 Government grants credited to profit in the year 2014 2013 000 000 SADI 1,709 1,128 IQ - 426 Other 222 265 1,931 1,819 Ultra Electronics Limited received a 222,000 2013: 265,000 grant from the Technology Strategy Board in the year.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of 9.5 million 2013: 3.47 million relating to tax losses, due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.
There are no temporary differences which arise in respect of undistributed earnings.
The main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The rate of 20% has been used to calculate the deferred tax balances at 31 December 2014 as this rate reduction was enacted before the balance sheet date.

Introduction 110 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 27 Share capital and share options continued The Groups equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value for all schemes other than the LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2014 Weighted average share price 16.03 17.14 17.44 n a Weighted average exercise price 14.81 17.37 17.40 n a Expected volatility % 24.5 25.3 24.9 n a Expected option life years 3.6 65 n a Risk-free interest rate % 1.1 1.6 1.2 n a Expected dividends % 2.3 1.7 2.2 n a Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2013 Weighted average share price 15.82 17.14 17.10 n a Weighted average exercise price 14.60 17.10 17.07 n a Expected volatility % 25.2 25.7 25.8 n a Expected option life years 3.6 65 n a Risk-free interest rate % 1.1 1.5 1.1 n a Expected dividends % 2.2 1.6 2.2 n a Figures in the above table show an average across the invested schemes at year end.
For the 2011, 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at grant date as this is the most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition.
The fair value of these schemes has been calculated using the following assumptions: 2014 2013 Exercise price n a n a Share price at grant 17.83 17.22 Expected option life years 3.0 3.0 Expected volatility % 23.1 24.2 Expected dividend yield % 0.0 0.0 Risk-free interest rate % 1.0 0.7 Figures in the above table show an average across the schemes.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 4.44 2013: 4.51.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options was 3.7 years 2013: 3.8 years.
