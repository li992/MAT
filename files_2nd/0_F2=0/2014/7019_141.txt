The transaction costs arose mainly on the acquisition see note 24 of ASL Holdings Limited and Talentum Developments Limited, which were acquired on 14 March 2013 and 11 April 2013 respectively.
The credit in the Medical Segment related mainly to the release of accrued fees arising on the MicroSurgical Technology, Inc. MST acquisition in the prior year.
The 12,456,000 credit to contingent consideration related mainly to a revision in the estimate of the MST payable from US$25,0000,000 to US$6,504,000.
