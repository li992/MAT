Prior to 1 January 1998 all goodwill was written off to reserves on the date of acquisition.
For acquisitions completed between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 no value was ascribed to intangibles other than goodwill and the goodwill on each acquisition was amortised over a period of up to 20 years.
On adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2003, the Group chose not to restate the goodwill balance and at that date the balance was frozen i. e. amortisation ceased.
If goodwill had been restated then a significant value would have been ascribed to other intangible assets, which would be subject to amortisation, and the carrying value of goodwill would be significantly lower.
For acquisitions completed after 1 January 2003 value has been ascribed to other intangible assets which are amortised.
Other intangible assets Other intangibles acquired include content, technology and software rights.
Intangible assets are valued separately for each acquisition and the primary method of valuation used is the discounted cash flow method.
The majority of acquired intangibles are amortised using an amortisation profile based on the projected cashflows underlying the acquisition date valuation of the intangible asset, which generally results in a larger proportion of amortisation being recognised in the early years of the assets life.
The Group keeps the expected pattern of consumption under review.
Amortisation of 12m 2013: 15m is included in the income statement in cost of goods sold and 238m 2013: 210m in operating expenses.
In 2014 nil 2013: 2m of amortisation relates to discontinued operations.

Following a reorganisation of the business effective 1 January 2014 goodwill was allocated to CGUs, or aggregation of CGUs where goodwill could not be reasonably allocated to individual business units.
Impairment reviews were conducted on these CGUs summarised below.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
Other than goodwill there are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.
The goodwill is generally denominated in the currency of the relevant cash flows and therefore the impairment review is not materially sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations.

Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill continued Following deterioration in the market conditions for the Groups online tutoring business based in India, it was determined in the course of the impairment review that the value in use of the India CGU no longer supported the carrying value of the goodwill in that CGU.
An impairment of 67m was booked, thereby bringing the carrying value of goodwill in the India CGU down to nil.
An impairment of 10m was also booked in respect of other acquired intangibles in that CGU, bringing their carrying value to nil.
The India CGU incorporates all the Groups trading operations in India.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.6% was used to determine the value in use of the India CGU.
No previous assessment had been made of the value in use of that CGU as the Groups India operations, prior to the 1 January 2014 reorganisation, were previously part of a larger Emerging Markets aggregated CGU.
Key assumptions The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
The key assumptions used by management in the value in use calculations were: Discount rates The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate for government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk in investing in equities.
The risk premium adjustment is assessed for each specific CGU.
The average pre-tax discount rates range from 9.0% to 16.4%.
Discount rates are lower for those businesses which operate in more mature markets with low inflation and higher for those operating in emerging markets with higher inflation.
Perpetuity growth rates A perpetuity growth rate of 2.0% 2013: 2.0% was used for cash flows subsequent to the approved budget period for CGUs operating in mature markets.
This perpetuity growth rate is a conservative rate and is considered to be lower than the long-term historic growth rates of the underlying territories in which the CGU operates and the long-term growth rate prospects of the sectors in which the CGU operates.
CGU growth rates between 5.0% and 5.8% were used for cash flows subsequent to the approved budget period for CGUs operating in emerging markets with high inflation.
These growth rates are also below the long-term historic growth rates in these markets.
The key assumptions used by management in setting the financial budgets for the initial five-year period were as follows: Forecast sales growth rates Forecast sales growth rates are based on past experience adjusted for the strategic direction and near-term investment priorities within each CGU.
Key factors include the proportion of revenue expected to arise in emerging markets, the proportion of revenue expected to come from digital and services businesses relative to traditional print-based businesses and the changing product mix as a result of product investment.
The five year sales forecasts use average nominal growth rates between 1.1% and 3.3% for mature markets and between 8.3% and 15.7% for emerging markets with high inflation.
Operating profits Operating profits are forecast based on historic experience of operating margins, adjusted for the impact of changes to product costs and cost saving initiatives, including the impact of the global restructuring programme undertaken in 2013 and 2014.
Cash conversion Cash conversion is the ratio of operating cashflow to operating profit.
Management forecast cash conversion rates based on historic experience, adjusted for the impact of product investment priorities and the shift to digital and service based business.
Sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to a change in assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and the perpetuity growth rates.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, a reasonably possible increase of 0.8% pts in the discount rate or a decrease of 1.0% pt in the perpetuity growth rate could cause an impairment in respect of Brazil.
