Reclassifi cations of fi financial instruments During the year ended 31 March 2009 the group reclassifi ed certain fi financial instruments out of fair value through profi t or loss.
These assets were originally classifi ed as held-for-trading but the groups intentions in regard to these assets changed and the group reclassifi ed 112.3 million and 7.8 million to the loans and receivables and available-for-sale classifi cations, respectively.
The amount reclassifi ed refl ected the fair value of the fi financial assets at the date of reclassifi cation.
The group did not undertake any further reclassifi cations under the amendment to IAS 39 in the current year and in the prior year.
The following table shows carrying values and fair values of the assets reclassifi ed: 2014 2013 Carrying Carrying At 31 March 000 value Fair value value Fair value Trading assets reclassifi ed to loans and receivables 31 746 16 441 46 025 26 784 31 746 16 441 46 025 26 784 If the reclassifi cations had not been made, the groups income before tax in 2014 would have reduced by 3.9 million 2013: a decrease of 8.6 million.
In the current year the reclassifi ed assets have contributed a 268 000 loss through the margin line and a loss of 4.1 million through impairments before taxation.
In the prior year, after the reclassifi cation, the assets contributed a 372 000 loss through the margin line and a loss of 4.9 million through impairments before taxation.
Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses recurring fair value measurements for fi financial assets and fi financial liabilities.
These fair value measurements are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.
The different levels are identifi ed as follows: Level 1 quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Assets and liabilities related to the long-term assurance business attributable to policyholders have been excluded from the analysis as the change in fair value of related assets is attributable to policyholders.
Fair value disclosures on investment properties are included in the Investment properties note 33 on page 81.

Observable inputs are defi ned as inputs that are developed using market data, such as publicly available information about actual events or transactions, and that refl ect the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
All other inputs have been considered to be unobservable.
The group transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy when the observability of inputs change or if the valuation methodschange.

Fair value hierarchy continued Sensitivity of fair values to reasonably possible alternative assumptions by level 3 instrument type The fair value of fi financial instruments in level 3 are measured using valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions that are not evidenced by prices from observable market data.

Other The valuation sensitivity for the private equity and embedded derivatives profi t share portfolios has been assessed by adjusting various inputs such as expected cash fl ows, discount rates, earnings multiples rather than a single input.
It is deemed appropriate to refl ect the outcome on a portfolio basis for the purposes of this analysis as the sensitivity of the investments cannot be determined through the adjustment of a single input.

Thecredit spread for an instrument forms part of the yield used in a discounted cash fl ow calculation.
In general a signifi cant increase in credit spread in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is unfavourable for the holder of a cash instrument.
Credit spreads are key inputs in the valuation of interest rate swaps.
Discount rates Discount rates are the interest rates used to discount future cash fl ows in a discount cash fl ow valuation method.
The discount rate takes into account time value of money and uncertainty of cash fl ows.
Volatilities Volatility is a key input in the valuation of derivative products containing optionality.
Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in returns for a given derivative underlying.
It represents an estimate of how much a particular underlying instrument, parameter or index willchange in value over time.
Cash fl ows Cash fl ows relate to the future cash fl ows which can be expected from the instrument and requires judgement.
EBITDA A company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.
This is the main input into a price earnings multiple valuationmethod.
