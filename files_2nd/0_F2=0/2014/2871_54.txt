The impairment testing as described is reliant on the accuracy of managements forecasts and the assumptions that underlie them and also on the selection of the discount and growth rates to be applied.
In order to gauge the sensitivity of the result to a change in any one, or combination of 17 Business combinations the assumptions that underlie the model, a number of scenarios have been run to measure which CGUs are the most susceptible to an impairment 2014 acquisitions should the assumptions used be varied.
The Group made a number of acquisitions in 2014 which are shown in aggregate.
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are disclosed in the table below: The sensitivity analysis on CGU cash flows has been carried out using a 100bps increase in the pre-tax discount rate, a 100bps reduction in growth Fair value rates, and a 100bps decrease in CGU year 1 operating margins between 2% and 33% impact on margins depending on CGU.
to Group recognised on The Insurance Services CGU, as reported previously, is the most sensitive to a change in a single or combination of assumptions and therefore profit acquisition and profit margins are closely monitored.
The headroom in the base case impairment test is 4m: the key assumptions driving this are stated above, m together with a year 1 operating margin of 13%.
The resulting impairment of goodwill of a 100bps adverse change in: the operating margin is 13m: Property, plant and equipment 11.6 the discount rate 4m: the growth rates applied 4m: and a combination of a 100bps adverse change in all, would be 41m.
Intangible assets 159.6 Trade and other receivables due in less than one year 56.6 Other smaller CGUs, which are not material to the Group, are also sensitive to changes in the assumptions, but movements would be immaterial.
Management continue to monitor closely the performance of all CGUs.

The companies acquired have been mainly in the areas of IT and software, customer and debt management, legal and property services, resourcing, communication and printing which complement or extend the Groups existing skill sets and provide opportunities for growth into these markets.
In addition, during the year the Group settled 35.5m of deferred consideration and 9.2m of contingent consideration payments with regard to previous acquisitions, all of which had been accrued.
Where this can be determined, the acquired subsidiaries contributed 14.3m to the profit before tax of the Group.
If these acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2014, Group revenue would have been an estimated 4,459.0m and Group profit before tax would have been an estimated 299.2m.
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2014.
During the year, some of the acquired businesses have been completely integrated into the existing business of the Group and therefore their post-acquisition performance cannot be determined.
Post-acquisition underlying earnings benefited from a 3.9m favourable litigation settlement, for which a provision was included in the balance sheet at the date of acquisition in 2013.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisitions because the fair value of the acquired assets was lower than the consideration paid: the goodwill represents the value to the Group that can be driven from these underlying assets over the life of the acquired businesses, particularly from synergies, and the capabilities of the acquired workforce.
The total amount of goodwill recognised in the period that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes is 9.6m 2013: 103.4m.
The fair value exercise has been completed on a provisional basis for acquisitions made in 2014.
The Group will complete this review in 2015 though any adjustment to the carrying value is likely to be insignificant to the individual acquisition.
In total, the effect of revisions made to fair value adjustments in the current year that had been determined provisionally at the immediately preceding balance sheet date increases goodwill by 0.5m.
Contingent consideration In respect of the acquisitions made in 2014, the Group has agreed to pay the vendors additional consideration dependent on the achievement of performance targets in the periods post acquisition.
These performance periods are of up to 3 years in duration and will be settled in cash on their payment date on achieving the relevant target.
The range of the additional consideration payment is estimated to be between 30m and 48m.
The Group has included 39.5m as contingent consideration related to the additional consideration, which represents its fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration has been calculated based on the Groups expectation of what it will pay in relation to the postacquisition performance of the acquired entities by weighting the probability of a range of payments to give an estimate of the final obligation.
Acquisition related costs The Group incurred acquisition related costs of 14.2m related to professional fees paid for due diligence, general professional fees and legal related costs.
These costs have been included in non-underlying administrative expenses in the Groups consolidated income statement.
