Basis of Preparation continued Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below: I. Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination from which goodwill arose.
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units, being portfolios of stores or individual businesses.
The cash-generating units used to monitor goodwill and test it for impairment are therefore the store portfolios and individual businesses.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less the costs to sell.
The recoverable amounts of these cash-generating units are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash-generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
See note 13 for further disclosure on impairment of goodwill and review of the key assumptions used.
Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Non-Current Other Assets Property, plant and equipment and non-current other assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is not recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting period date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would be held net of depreciation if no impairment had been realised.
Impairment of Other Intangible Assets with Definite Lives The Group is required to test whether other intangible assets with a definite useful economic life have suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount of brand names is based on an estimation of future sales and the choice of a suitable royalty and discount rate in order to calculate the present value, when this method is deemed the most appropriate.
Alternatively the carrying value of the brand names has been allocated to a cash-generating unit, along with the relevant goodwill and fascia names, and tested in the value-in-use calculation performed for that cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount of brand licences is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash-generating unit until the license expiry date and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Note 13 provides further disclosure on impairment of other intangible assets with definite lives, including review of the key assumptions used.

Basis of Preparation continued Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements Continued IV.
Impairment of Other Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives The Group is required to test whether other intangible assets with an indefinite useful economic life have suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount of these assets is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
Note 13 provides further detail of the judgements made by the Board in determining that the lives of acquired fascia names are indefinite and further disclosure on impairment of other intangible assets with indefinite lives, including review of the key assumptions used.
V. Provisions to Write Inventories Down to Net Realisable Value The Group makes provisions for obsolescence, mark downs and shrinkage based on historical experiences and management estimates of future events.
Onerous Property Lease Provisions The Group makes a provision for onerous property leases on specific stores based on the anticipated future cash outflows relating to the contractual lease cost less potential sublease income.
The estimation of sublease income is based on historical experience and knowledge of the retail property market in the area around each specific property.
Significant assumptions and judgements are used in making these estimates and changes in assumptions and future events could cause the value of these provisions to change.
This would include sublet premises becoming vacant, the liquidation of an assignee resulting in a property reverting to the Group or closing an uneconomic store and subletting at below contracted rent.
Value of Put Options Held by Non-Controlling Interest The Group recognises put options over non-controlling interests in its subsidiary undertakings as a liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at the present value of the estimated exercise price of the put option.
The present value of the non-controlling interests put options are estimated based on expected earnings in Board-approved forecasts and the choice of a suitable discount rate.
Upon initial recognition, and for subsequent changes on remeasurement of the liability, a corresponding entry is made to other equity.
Estimation of Useful Economic Lives of Brand Names The Group amortises brand names over their useful economic life.
In determining the useful economic life of each brand name, the Board considers the market position of the brands acquired, the nature of the market that the brands operate in, typical product life cycles of brands and the useful economic lives of similar assets that are used in comparable ways.
Determination of Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities on Acquisition For each acquisition, the Group reviews the appropriateness of the book values of the assets and liabilities acquired, taking into account the application of Group accounting policies, to determine if fair value adjustments are required.
The key judgements involved are the identification and valuation of intangible assets which require the estimation of future cash flows based on the Boards strategic plans for the intangible asset, the useful economic life of the intangible asset and the selection of a suitable discount rate.

Segmental Analysis IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires the Groups segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered to be the Executive Chairman of JD Sports Fashion Plc.
Information reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker is focused on the nature of the businesses within the Group.
In the current period the reportable segments have been adjusted to reflect the streamlining of the Groups businesses into three main operating divisions.
This has resulted in those businesses that were previously allocated to the distribution segment now being allocated to the Sport and Fashion segments based on the nature of the products they supply.
The Groups revised reportable segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows: Sport includes the results of JD Sports Fashion Plc, John David Sports Fashion Ireland Limited, Spodis SA, Champion Sports Ireland, JD Sprinter Holdings 2010 SL including subsidiary companies, JD Sports Fashion BV, JD Sports Fashion Germany GmbH, ActivInstinct Limited, Duffer of St George Limited, Topgrade Sportswear Limited, Kooga Rugby Limited, Focus Brands Limited including subsidiary companies, Kukri Sports Limited including global subsidiary companies and Source Lab Limited.
Canterbury Limited including global subsidiary companies was also included in the prior period until the point of disposal see note 12 Fashion includes the results of Bank Fashion Limited, R. D. Scott Limited, Premium Fashion Limited, Tessuti Group Limited including subsidiary companies, Nicholas Deakins Limited, Cloggs Online Limited and Ark Fashion Limited Outdoor includes the results of Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited and Tiso Group Limited including subsidiary companies The Chief Operating Decision Maker receives and reviews segmental operating profit.
Certain central administrative costs including Group Directors salaries are included within the Groups core Sport result.
This is consistent with the results as reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
IFRS 8 requires disclosure of information regarding revenue from major products and customers.
The majority of the Groups revenue is derived from the retail of a wide range of apparel, footwear and accessories to the general public.
As such, the disclosure of revenues from major customers is not appropriate.
Disclosure of revenue from major product groups is not provided at this time due to the cost involved to develop a reliable product split on a same category basis across all companies in the Group.
Intersegment transactions are undertaken in the ordinary course of business on arms length terms.
The Board consider that certain items are cross divisional in nature and cannot be allocated between the segments on a meaningful basis.
Net funding costs and taxation are treated as unallocated reflecting the nature of the Groups syndicated borrowing facilities and its tax group.
Drawdowns from the Groups syndicated borrowing facility of 26,000,000 2013: nil, a deferred tax liability of 4,283,000 2013: liability of 3,852,000 and an income tax liability of 11,596,000 2013: 8,817,000 are included within the unallocated segment.
Each segment is shown net of intercompany transactions and balances within that segment.
The eliminations remove intercompany transactions and balances between different segments which primarily relate to the net down of long term loans and short term working capital funding provided by JD Sports Fashion Plc within Sport to other companies in the Group, and intercompany trading between companies in different segments.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes.
In the case of goods sold through the retail stores and trading websites, revenue is recognised when goods are sold and the title has passed, less provision for returns.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of the sale.
Retail sales are usually in cash, by debit card or by credit card.
In the case of goods not sold directly through the retail stores, revenue is recognised when goods are sold and the title has passed less a provision for credit notes.
Wholesale sales are either settled by cash received in advance of the goods being dispatched or made on agreed credit terms.

Current Income Tax Current income tax expense is calculated using the tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date, adjusted for any tax paid in respect of prior years.
Deferred Tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: Goodwill not deductible for tax purposes The initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Acquisitions Business Combinations All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Current Period Acquisitions Cloggs Online Limited On 13 February 2013, the Group acquired, via its new 88% owned subsidiary Cloggs Online Limited, the trade and assets of Cloggs UK Limited Cloggs from its Administrators for a total cash consideration of 579,000.
Cloggs is an online niche retailer of premium branded footwear.
In December 2013, Cloggs opened its first retail store.
The Board believes that the excess of consideration paid over net identifiable assets on acquisition of 700,000 represents the fair value of the Cloggs online fascia name.
Included in the 52 week period to 1 February 2014 is revenue of 4,701,000 and a loss before tax of 617,000 in respect of Cloggs Online Limited.
Setpoint RE BV On 1 May 2013, the Group acquired Setpoint RE BV for a cash consideration of 1,280,000 1,600,000.
Setpoint RE BV was established on 26 April 2013 with its only asset being the leases of 15 stores in the Netherlands which were transferred into it on 27 April 2013 from Setpoint BV who were looking to close down their retail operations.
Following a refit, 14 of these stores now trade under the JD fascia with one store handed back to the landlord.
The only asset acquired is the right to the leases, with a fair value of 1,280,000 1,600,000.
As the acquisition does not constitute a business combination under IFRS 3, the Group has not applied acquisition accounting.
Ark Fashion Limited On 28 June 2013, the Group acquired, via its new 70% owned subsidiary Ark Fashion Limited, the trade and assets of Rett Retail Limited from its Administrators for a total cash consideration of 1,138,000.
On acquisition, there were nine stores trading as Ark in the North of England and the Midlands with a separate trading website.
Since acquisition one of the loss making stores has been closed.
The Board believes that the excess of consideration paid over net identifiable assets on acquisition of 469,000 represents the fair value of the Ark fascia name.
Included in the 52 week period to 1 February 2014 is revenue of 6,008,000 and a loss before tax of 803,000 in respect of Ark Fashion Limited.
Sports Eric Isichei & Soehne oHG On 1 July 2013, the Group acquired, via its new 85% subsidiary JD Sports Fashion Germany GmbH, the trade and assets of Isico U. S. A.
Sports Eric Isichei & Soehne oHG Isico for a cash consideration of 800,000 1,000,000.
On acquisition, Isico had 10 small stores primarily in Berlin but with a presence also in Hamburg, Hannover and Frankfurt.
It is intended that these stores will be rebranded to JD through 2014.
The Board believes that the excess of consideration paid over the provisional fair value of the net identifiable assets of 982,000 is best considered as goodwill on acquisition representing employee expertise.

Disposals Prior Period Disposals Disposal of 100% of the Issued Ordinary Share Capital of Canterbury Limited and its Subsidiary Undertakings On 13 September 2012 the Group disposed of its 100% shareholding in Canterbury Limited to Pentland Group Plc for a total cash payment of 22,698,521 and acquired the ONETrueSaxon Brand.
The total cash payment received comprised 1 for the entire share capital of Canterbury Limited and 22,698,520 which repaid the total intercompany receivable balance owing to the Company from the Canterbury Group at the date of disposal.
The assets and liabilities related to Canterbury Limited and its subsidiary undertakings formed a disposal group.
However, Canterbury was not treated as a discontinued operation at 2 February 2013, as its teamwear and leisurewear offering did not represent a major line of business.
Financial information related to the disposal is set out below: 000 Consideration received 22,699 Less carrying value of net assets disposed of 19,748 Plus share of translation reserve recycled 910 Less non-controlling interest disposed of 2,570 Less transaction costs 600 Profit on disposal 691 Net cashflow on disposal: Consideration received 22,699 Less cash and cash equivalents disposed of 5,888 Net cash inflow from disposal 16,811 Financial Statements 84 85 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 13.
The Bank business is a cash-generating unit and is included in the Fashion segment.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the value-in-use, which has been calculated using a pre-tax discount of rate of 12.2% 2013: 13.3%.
In the prior year, 2,315,000 of the goodwill was impaired, following a difficult trading period where revenues on certain key brands declined.
Current year trading in Bank stores has continued to be difficult with reduced revenue across womenswear, which has resulted in the remaining goodwill of 11,839,000 being impaired.
The Board believes that the Bank fascia name of 5,481,000 is recoverable after having performed relevant sensitivity analysis.
Divestment of Subsidiaries The divestment in the prior period of 4,868,000 relates to the carrying value of the Canterbury brand name recognised on acquisition of Canterbury Limited in 2009.
The Group disposed its 100% shareholding in Canterbury Limited on 13 September 2012 see note 12.

Intangible Assets Continued Intangibles Assets with Definite Lives Brand licences Brand licences are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation of brand licences is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement within cost of sales over the term to the licence expiry on a straight line basis.
Brand licenses are tested annually for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to their carrying value.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the relevant cash-generating unit until the license expiry date and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
The Groups brand licenses and the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations, is as follows: Basic information Impairment model assumptions used Net Net Short Long Pre-tax Pre-tax Book Book term term discount discount Value Value growth growth rate 3 rate 3 Cost 2014 2013 rate 1 rate 2 2014 2013 Group Segment Terms 000 000 000 % % Margin rate % % Gross margins over the remaining license period are assumed to be 10 year license from January 2011 broadly consistent with approved for exclusive use of the brand in the budget levels for the period ending Fila Sport UK and Republic of Ireland 7,500 5,188 5,938 2.0% 2.0% January 15 13.3% 13.9% Gross margins over the remaining license period are assumed to be broadly consistent with approved Sergio Sub-licence to use the brand in the budget levels for the period ending Tacchini Sport UK until 2019 4,279 2,048 2,410 2.0% 2.0% January 15 13.3% 13.9% 11,779 7,236 8,348 1 The short term growth rate is the Board approved compound annual growth rate in sales for the first two year period following the January 2015 financial year currently underway 2 The long term growth rate is the rate used thereafter until the end of the license period 3 The discount rate applied is pre-tax and reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the assets, for which future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.

Intangible Assets Continued Brand Names Brand names acquired as part of a business combination are stated at fair value as at the acquisition date less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Brand names separately acquired are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The useful economic life of each purchased brand name is considered to be finite.
Brand names are all amortised over a period of 10 years and the amortisation charge is included within administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Brand names are tested annually for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to their carrying value.
The recoverable amount of brand names is determined based on a royalty relief method of valuation.
This is based on an estimation of future sales and the choice of a suitable royalty and discount rate in order to calculate the present value, when this method is deemed the most appropriate.
This method involves calculating a net present value for each brand by discounting the projected future royalties expected over the remaining useful life of each brand.
The future royalties are estimated by applying a suitable royalty rate to the sales forecast.
Alternatively the carrying value of the brand names has been allocated to a cash-generating unit, along with the relevant goodwill and fascia names, and tested in the value-in-use calculation performed for that cash-generating unit see below.

Intangible Assets Continued Software Development Software developments costs including website development costs are capitalised as Intangible Assets if the technical and commercial feasibility of the project has been demonstrated, the future economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably.
Costs that do not meet these criteria are expensed as incurred.
Software development costs are stated at historic cost, less accumulated amortisation.
Software development costs are all amortised over a period of three to four years and the amortisation charge is included within administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Intangibles Assets with Indefinite Lives Fascia Name Separately identifiable fascia names acquired are stated at fair value as at the acquisition date less accumulated impairment losses.
Fascia names are not being amortised as management consider these assets to have indefinite useful economic life.
As such all fascia names are subject to an impairment review on an annual basis or more frequently if there is an indicator that the fascia name is impaired.
Factors considered by the Board in determining that the useful life of the fascia names are indefinite for all fascia names: The strength of the respective fascia names in the relevant sector and geographic region where the fascia is located The history of the fascia names and that of similar assets in the UK in relation to Blacks, Millets, Bank, Tessuti, Ark and Tiso, Republic of Ireland Champion, Spain Sprinter and Germany Isico retail sectors The commitment of the Group to continue to operate these stores separately for the foreseeable future, including the ongoing investment in new stores and refurbishments The strength of the respective online fascia names for the online fascias acquired in the period Cloggs and ActivInstinct Goodwill Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
Method 1: For acquisitions on or after 31 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit loss on disposal.
Method 2: In respect of business acquisitions that occurred from 1 February 2004 to 30 January 2010, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
When the excess was negative negative goodwill, it was recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement as an exceptional item.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
Method 3: In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 February 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 February 2004 has not been reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening adopted IFRS balance sheet at 1 February 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment and whenever there is an indication that the goodwill may be impaired.
The cash-generating units used are either the store portfolios or individual businesses acquired.
The recoverable amount is compared to the carrying amount of the cash-generating units including goodwill.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The carrying amount of goodwill and fascia name by cash-generating units, along with the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation is set out on the following pages.

Intangible Assets Continued Sensitivity Analysis A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the base case assumptions of sales growth and discounts rates used for assessing the goodwill.
With regards to the assessment of value-in-use of all cash-generating units, with the exceptions of those listed below, the Board believe that there are no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions, which would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the Bank fascia name and Blacks goodwill and fascia name cash-generating units, changes in key assumptions could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
The Board has considered the possibility of each of these businesses achieving less revenue and gross profit % than forecast.
Whilst any reduction in revenue would be partially offset by a reduction in revenue related costs, the Board would also take actions to mitigate the loss of gross profit by reducing other costs.
Bank Should the pre-tax discount rate increase by 1.0%, the value-in-use would lead to an impairment of the Bank fascia name of 2,660,000.
All other assumptions remain unchanged.
The impairment model prepared by management assumes margin growth of 3.7% up to 50.3% in the first five year period.
Should the business achieve assumed gross margin rate % growth of 3.0% in the first five year period and be unable to reduce selling and distribution and administrative costs, the reduction in value-in-use would lead to an impairment of the Bank fascia name of 5,480,000.
Should the business achieve assumed margin rate % growth of 3.4% in the first five year period and be unable to reduce selling and distribution and administrative costs, the reduction in value-in-use would lead to an impairment of 2,030,000.
In both cases all other assumptions remain unchanged.
Blacks Should the business not achieve the assumed gross margin rate % growth in the first five year period of 6.3% by 1.0% and be unable to reduce selling and distribution and administrative costs, the reduction in value-in-use would lead to an impairment of 6,000,000.
Brand names in the Company comprise all brand names included in the Group table on page 86 within the Sport segment, with the exception of the fair value adjustments remaining in relation to brand names acquired on acquisition of Duffer of St George 1,110,000 and Kukri 504,000.
Financial Statements 90 91 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 14.
Property, Plant and Equipment Owned Assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful economic lives, they are accounted for as separate items.
Legal fees and other costs associated with the acquisition of a leasehold interest are capitalised within non-current other assets see note 16.
These costs are amortised over the life of the lease.
Lease incentives are credited to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Rental income from operating leases where the Group is the lessor is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Property, Plant and Equipment Continued In the prior period, assets in the course of construction of 18,762,000 relating to the new warehouse development at Kingsway, Rochdale were transferred to fixtures and fittings.
Impairment charges of 1,786,000 2013: 714,000 relate to all classes of property, plant and equipment in cash-generating units which are loss making and where it is considered that the position cannot be recovered as a result of a continuing deterioration in the performance in the particular store.
The cash-generating units represent individual stores, or a collection of stores where the cash flows are not independent, with the loss based on the specific revenue streams and costs attributable to those cash-generating units.
Assets in impaired stores are written down to their recoverable amount which is calculated as the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
Leased Assets Assets funded through finance leases and similar hire purchase contracts are capitalised as property, plant and equipment where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Future instalments under such leases, net of financing costs, are included within interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
Rental payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is included in finance costs, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments so as to give a constant charge on the outstanding obligation.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases and the rental costs, are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Contingent rental payments, where payment is conditional on the Groups operating performance derived from the lease item e. g. turnover levels, are expensed in the period incurred.
The carrying amount of the Groups property, plant and equipment includes an amount of 49,000 2013: 1,479,000 in respect of assets held under finance leases, comprising fixtures and fittings of nil 2013: 1,427,000 and motor vehicles of 49,000 2013: 52,000.
The depreciation charge on those assets for the current period was 42,000 2013: 672,000, comprising fixtures and fittings of 10,000 2013: 643,000 and motor vehicles of 32,000 2013: 29,000.
Investment Property Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Investment property is depreciated over a period of 50 years on a straight line basis, with the exception of freehold land, which is not depreciated.
The Group has elected not to revalue investment property annually but to disclose the fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The fair value is based on an external valuation prepared by persons having the appropriate professional qualification and experience.
Company 000 Cost At 28 January 2012 4,160 Additions 677 At 2 February 2013 and 1 February 2014 4,837 Depreciation and impairment At 28 January 2012 1,190 Charge for period 33 At 2 February 2013 1,223 Charge for period 41 At 1 February 2014 1,264 Net book value At 1 February 2014 3,573 At 2 February 2013 3,614 At 28 January 2012 2,970 The investment properties brought forward relates to properties leased to Focus Brands Limited 4,160,000 and Kukri Sports Limited 677,000.
Both of these properties are owner-occupied from the perspective of the Group as both Focus Brands Limited and Kukri Sports Limited are subsidiaries of the Group.
These properties however remain investment properties from the Company perspective as at 1 February 2014.
Based on an external valuation, the fair value of the investment properties as at 1 February 2014 was 3,477,000 2013: 3,427,000.
Management do not consider either of the investment properties to be impaired as the future rental income supports the carrying value.
Financial Statements 94 95 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 16.
Non-Current Other Assets Key Money Monies paid in certain countries to give access to retail locations are capitalised within non-current assets.
Key money is stated at historic cost less impairment losses.
These assets are not depreciated as past experience has shown that the key money is fully recoverable on disposal of a retail location and is deemed to have an indefinite useful economic life but will be impaired if evidence exists that the market value is less than the historic cost.
Gains losses on key money from the subsequent disposal of these retail locations are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Deposits Money paid in certain countries as deposits to store landlords as protection against non-payment of rent, is capitalised within non-current assets.
A provision for the impairment of these deposits is established when there is objective evidence that the landlord will not repay the deposit in full.
Legal Fees Legal fees and other costs associated with the acquisition of a leasehold interest are capitalised within non-current other assets and amortised over the life of the lease.
Investments In the Companys accounts all investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are stated at cost less provisions for impairment losses.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the equity attributable to holders of the parent.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date that control commences and the attributable share of changes in equity subsequent to that date.
Joint Ventures Joint ventures are entities over which the Group has joint control based on a contractual arrangement.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets.
Losses of the joint venture in excess of the Groups interest in it are not recognised.
Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation Intragroup balances, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Changes in Ownership Interest Without a Loss of Control In accordance with IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 2008, upon a change in ownership interest in a subsidiary without a loss of control, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary.
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
Acquisitions or disposals of non-controlling interests are therefore accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
Associated transaction costs are accounted for within equity.

The Company has 6,813,000 2013: 7,574,000 of stock provisions at the end of the period.
Financial Statements 96 97 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 19.
Trade and Other Receivables Trade receivables are recognised at amortised cost less impairment losses.
A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Trade and Other Receivables Continued Analysis of gross trade receivables is shown below: Group Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 Not past due or impaired 6,061 7,256 424 896 Past due but not impaired 9,465 4,208 689 580 Impaired 973 1,559 430 721 16,499 13,023 1,543 2,197 The aging of the impaired trade receivables is detailed below: Group Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 Not past due 84 364 8 11 Past due 0 - 30 days 132 - 45 - Past due 30 - 60 days 31 345 31 342 Past 60 days 726 850 346 368 973 1,559 430 721 The Board consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximate their fair value.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the majority of the Groups customer base being wide and unrelated.
Therefore, no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for impairment losses, which has been calculated following individual assessments of credit quality based on historic default rates and knowledge of debtor insolvency or other credit risk.
Movement on this provision is shown below: Group Company 000 000 At 28 January 2012 1,020 100 Created 435 - Released 29 - Utilised 139 - Divestments 639 - Exchange differences 11 - At 2 February 2013 637 100 Created 171 - Released 10 - Utilised 142 - Exchange differences 6 - At 1 February 2014 650 100 The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, as these are used as an integral part of the Groups cash management.
Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Following the initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.

Bank Facilities On 10 July 2013, the Group amended and extended its syndicated committed 75,000,000 bank facility which previously expired on 11 October 2015.
The facility has been amended by increasing the syndicated committed facility by 80,000,000 to 155,000,000.
The amended facility now expires on 11 October 2017.
Under the amended facility, a maximum of 10 drawdowns can be outstanding at any time with drawdowns made for a period of one, two, three or six months with interest currently payable at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% 2013: 1.40%.
The arrangement fee payable on the amended facility is 0.6% on the additional 80,000,000 commitment and 0.3% on the existing 75,000,000 commitment.
The commitment fee on the undrawn element of the facility is 45% of the applicable margin rate.
This facility encompasses cross guarantees between the Company, Bank Fashion Limited, RD Scott Limited, Topgrade Sportswear Limited, Nicholas Deakins Limited, Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited, Millets Limited and Focus International Limited.
At 1 February 2014, 26,000,000 was drawn down on this facility 2013: no amounts were drawn down on this facility.

The interest rates ranged from 5.10% to 6.50% and were secured on the fixtures in those particular stores.
The maturity of the bank loans and overdrafts is as follows: Group Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 Within one year 4,869 7,036 - - Between one and five years 173 288 - - 5,042 7,324 - - Other Loans The acquisition of Tessuti Group Limited included a freehold property with a mortgage balance remaining of 508,000 at the time of acquisition.

Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings Continued Finance Leases As at 1 February 2014, the Groups liabilities under finance leases are analysed as follows: Present value Minimum of minimum lease lease payments payments 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 Amounts payable under finance leases: Within one year 43 51 37 49 Later than one year and not later than five years 39 8 35 7 After five years - - - - 82 59 72 56 Assets held under finance leases consist primarily of motor vehicles.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximate to their present value.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors rights over the leased assets.
Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial Assets The Groups financial assets are all categorised as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise Trade and other receivables and Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term cash deposits with major United Kingdom and European clearing banks earning floating rates of interest based upon bank base rates or rates linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
Financial Instruments Continued Financial Liabilities The Groups financial liabilities are all categorised as other financial liabilities.
Other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
The Groups other financial liabilities comprise Interest-bearing loans and borrowings and Trade and other payables.
The currency profile of interest-bearing loans and borrowings is shown below: Group Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 31,521 7,848 26,000 - Sterling 30,141 469 26,000 - Euros 1,351 7,344 - - US Dollars 25 25 - - New Zealand Dollars - - - - Canadian Dollars 4 10 - - 31,521 7,848 26,000 - Risk Management The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk and its liquidity position.
The Group manages these risks through the use of derivative instruments, which are reviewed on a regular basis.
Derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
There are no concentrations of risk in the period to 1 February 2014.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations by a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Groups borrowings are at floating rates, partially hedged by floating rate interest on deposits, reflecting the seasonality of its cash flow.
Interest rate risk therefore arises from bank borrowings.
Interest rate hedging has not been put in place on the current facility.
The Directors continue to be mindful of the potential volatility in base rates, but at present do not consider a long term interest rate hedge to be necessary given the inherent short term nature of both the revolving credit facility and working capital facility.
This position is reviewed regularly, along with the level of facility required.
The Group has potential bank floating rate financial liabilities on the 155,000,000 committed bank facility, together with overdraft facilities in subsidiary companies see note 21.
At 1 February 2014 26,000,000 was drawdown from the committed bank facility 2013: nil.
When drawdowns are made, the Group is exposed to cash flow interest risk with interest paid at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.50% 2013: 1.40%.
As at 1 February 2014 the Group has liabilities of 72,000 2013: 56,000, in respect of finance lease or similar hire purchase contracts.
A change of 1.0% in the average interest rates during the year, applied to the Groups floating interest rate loans and borrowings as at the reporting date, would change profit before tax by 517,000 2013: 60,000 and would change equity by 517,000 2013: 60,000.
The calculation is based on any floating interest rate loans and borrowings drawn down at the period end date.
This includes the Groups committed bank facility, Tiso Group Limiteds overdraft and Sprinter Megacentros Del Deporte SLU bank loans and borrowings.
Calculations are performed on the same basis as the prior year and assume that all other variables remain unchanged.
Financial Statements 102 103 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 22.
Financial Instruments continued Foreign Currency Risk Foreign Currency Translation Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the reporting date.
Exchange differences in monetary items are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the reporting date.
Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the accounting period.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and are presented in the foreign currency translation reserve.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value and remeasured at each period end.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Interest rate swaps are recognised at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position with movements in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the respective risk profiles of the swap counterparties.
Hedging of Monetary Assets and Liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than pound sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are the Euro and US Dollar with sales made in Euros and purchases made in both Euros and US Dollars principal exposure.
To protect its foreign currency position, the Group sets a buying rate in each country for the purchase of goods in US Dollars at the start of the buying season typically six to nine months before the product actually starts to appear in the stores and then enters into a number of local currency US Dollar contracts whereby the minimum exchange rate on the purchase of dollars is guaranteed.
As at 1 February 2014, options have been entered into to protect approximately 91% of the US Dollar requirement for the period to January 2015.
The balance of the US Dollar requirement for the period will be satisfied at spot rates.
As at 1 February 2014, the fair value of these instruments was a liability of 5,813,000 2013: asset of 441,000 which has been included within current liabilities 2013: current assets.
A loss of 6,254,000 2013: gain of 411,000 has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the change in fair value of these instruments.
We have considered the credit risk of the Groups and counterpartys credit risk and this is not expected to have a material effect on the valuation of these options.

Credit Risk Credit risk arises from the possibility of customers and counterparties failing to meet their obligations to the Group.
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through major United Kingdom and European clearing banks, which must meet minimum credit ratings as required by the Board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for impairment where amounts are not thought to be recoverable see note 19.
At the reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and receivables which are not impaired are believed to be recoverable.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be equivalent to total trade and other receivables of 66,966,000 2013: 56,761,000 and cash and cash equivalents of 76,949,000 2013: 53,484,000.
The Company has provided guarantees on working capital and other banking facilities entered into by Spodis SA, Sprinter Megacentros Del Deporte SLU and Champion Sports Ireland of 5,000,000, 8,750,000 and up to maximum of 3,000,000 respectively.
The Company had also provided a guarantee on the finance lease facility in relation to the acquisition of Champion Sports Ireland up to a maximum of 2,500,000, however this is now fully repaid as at 1 February 2014.
In addition, the syndicated committed 155,000,000 bank facility, which was in place as at 1 February 2014, encompassed cross guarantees between the Company, RD Scott Limited, Bank Fashion Limited, Topgrade Sportswear Limited, Nicholas Deakins Limited, Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited, Millets Limited and Focus International Limited to the extent to which any of these companies were overdrawn.
As at 1 February 2014, these facilities were drawn down by 26,000,000 2013: nil.
Financial Instruments Continued Liquidity Risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirement to minimise net interest expense, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of the business.
The forecast cash and borrowing profile of the Group is monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.
The Board review 13 week and annual cash flow forecasts each month.

The present value of these options has been estimated as at 1 February 2014 and is included within non-current other payables and accrued expenses.
The present value of the estimated exercise price is calculated using the option price formula agreed on acquisition.
All existing option price formulas are based on a profit measure, which is estimated by applying an approved growth assumption to the current budget profit for the January 2015 financial year, if appropriate for the individual business the put option directly relates to.
A discount rate is also applied to the option price which is pre-tax and reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and any specific risk premiums relevant to the individual businesses involved.
These discount rates are considered to be equivalent to the rates a market participant would use.
