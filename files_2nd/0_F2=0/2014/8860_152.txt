175 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2014 40 Effect of restatements The adoption of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and the revised IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures changes the definition of when the group controls another entity and, as a result, from 1st April 2013 one entity is accounted for as a joint venture rather than a subsidiary.
The impact on the year ended 31st March 2014 was to decrease profit for the year by 0.5 million and decrease net assets and increase non-controlling interests by 3.2 million.
The revision to IAS 19 Employee Benefits, which the group has adopted from 1st April 2013, removes the corridor approach for recognising actuarial gains and losses and eliminates options for presenting gains and losses, neither of which have any effect on the group.
It also amends the disclosures and requires the replacement of the expected return on plan assets and interest cost on plan obligations with net interest on the net defined benefit liability based on the discount rate.
In addition, past service costs are no longer spread over the vesting period but are immediately expensed.
The group has decided to include net interest on the net defined benefit liabilities in finance costs and reimbursement rights for the US post-retirement medical benefits plan in post-employment benefits net assets.
The impact on the year ended 31st March 2014 was to increase operating profit by 2.6 million, increase finance costs by 10.5 million, decrease income tax expense by 2.3 million, increase the remeasurement gain by 8.6 million and increase the related tax charge by 2.2 million, decrease employee benefit obligations by 2.6 million and increase deferred tax liabilities by 0.6 million.
The restatements decrease the basic, diluted and underlying earnings per share for the year ended 31st March 2014 by 3.0 pence.
