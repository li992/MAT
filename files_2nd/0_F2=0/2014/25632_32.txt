These separate entity level accounts have been produced on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards in the UK.
A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year, is set out below: Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation are taken directly to the profit and loss account to the extent that the Company is exposed to exchange differences arising on such assets and liabilities.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year at current rates of tax and takes into account deferred tax.
Full provision for deferred tax, without discounting, is made for all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Consolidated accounts Separate consolidated accounts have been prepared and are presented on pages 81 to 137.
Subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less any provisions for permanent diminution in value.
A list of principal subsidiaries is set out in note 34 on page 137.
Investment income Interest on deposits and interest-bearing investments is credited as it is earned.
Dividend distribution Dividends proposed or declared after the balance sheet dates are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Final dividends are recognised as a charge to shareholders' funds once approved and interim dividends are charged once paid.
Related parties The Company is exempt under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 8 from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the JLT Group or investees of the JLT Group.
All related party transactions external to the Group are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements of JLT Group.
Cash flow statement The Company is exempt under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 1 from the requirement to publish its own cash flow statement, as its cash flow is included within the consolidated cash flow statement of the Group.
