Impairments Impairment losses in each segment are described below.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to impairments see Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill within Note 1.
Upstream The 2014 impairment losses of $6,737 million included $4,876 million in the North Sea business, of which $1,964 million related to the Valhall cashgenerating unit CGU, $660 million related to the Andrew area CGU, and $515 million related to the ETAP CGU.
These CGUs have recoverable amounts of $767 million, $1,431 million, and $1,753 million respectively.
Impairment losses also included an $859-million impairment of our PSVM CGU in Angola to its recoverable amount of $1,964 million, and a $415-million impairment of the Block KG D6 CGU in India to its recoverable amount of $2,364 million.
The recoverable amount of the Block KG D6 CGU is stated after the exploration write-off described in Note 6.
All of the impairments relate to producing assets.
The impairments in the North Sea and Angola arose as a result of a lower price environment in the near term, technical reserves revisions, and increases in expected decommissioning cost estimates.
The impairment of Block KG D6 arose following the introduction of a new formula for Indian gas prices.
The recoverable amounts of the Valhall and Block KG D6 CGUs are their fair values less costs of disposal based on the present value of future cash flows, a level-3 valuation technique in the fair value hierarchy.
The key assumptions in the tests were oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and the discount rate.
The recoverable amounts of the Andrew area CGU, the ETAP CGU and the PSVM CGU are their values in use.
See Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill within Note 1 for further information on assumptions used for impairment testing.
The discount rate used to determine the value in use of the PSVM CGU included the 2% premium for higher-risk countries as described in Note 1.
A premium was not applied in determining the recoverable amount of the other CGUs.
The main elements of the 2013 impairment losses of $1,255 million were a $251-million impairment loss relating to the Browse project in Australia and a $253-million aggregate write-down of a number of assets in the North Sea, caused by increases in expected decommissioning costs.
Impairment reversals arose on certain of our interests in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, and the North Sea, triggered by reductions in decommissioning provisions due to continued review of the expected decommissioning costs and an increase in the discount rate for provisions.
The main elements of the 2012 impairment losses of $3,046 million were a $1,082-million write-down of our interests in certain shale gas assets in the US, due to reserves revisions, lower values being attributed to recent market transactions and a fall in the gas price: a $999-million impairment loss relating to the decision to suspend the Liberty project in Alaska: a $706-million aggregate write-down of a number of assets, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea, caused by increases in the decommissioning provision resulting from continued review of the expected decommissioning costs.
Impairment reversals principally arose on certain of our interests in the Gulf of Mexico, triggered by a decision to divest assets.
Downstream The main elements of the 2014 impairment losses of $1,264 million related to our Bulwer Island refinery and certain midstream assets in our fuels business, and certain manufacturing assets in our petrochemicals business.
The main elements of the 2013 impairment losses of $484 million related to impairments of certain refineries in the US and elsewhere in our global fuels portfolio.
The main elements of the 2012 impairment losses of $2,892 million related to assets held for sale for which sales prices had been agreed.
This included $1,552 million relating to the Texas City refinery and associated assets and $1,042 million relating to the Carson refinery and associated assets.
