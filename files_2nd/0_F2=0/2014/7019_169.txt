Commitments under operating leases The Group has entered into commercial leases on properties and other equipment.
The former expire between April 2014 and November 2028 and the latter between April 2014 and March 2019.
Only certain property agreements contain an option for renewal at rental prices based on market prices at the time of exercise.
Total payments under non-cancellable operating leases will be made as follows: Land and buildings Other 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 Within one year 6,566 7,410 453 693 Within two to five years 13,989 17,424 856 602 After five years 2,257 3,374 22,812 28,208 1,309 1,295 28 Retirement benefits Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan both UK have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections had already closed to new entrants in 2002 03.
During the year, following consultation with members, it was decided that future benefit accruals for existing members of these sections would cease from 1 December 2014.
The members would then join the existing defined contribution section, which was established within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
This closure to future benefit accruals resulted in a curtailment gain of 4,246,000 before closure costs of 298,000, which has been included in the Adjustments column in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Overseas subsidiaries have adopted mainly defined contribution schemes, with the exception of two small defined benefit schemes in the Swiss entities of Medicel AG and Robutec GmbH.
Defined contribution schemes The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 4,042,000 2013: 3,658,000 and represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the ancillary contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
Defined benefit schemes The Groups significant defined benefit schemes are for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries.
Under the schemes, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 60, for members of the Executive Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employees.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The schemes are funded schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out at 1 December 2011 by Mr Adrian Gibbons, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
Mr Gibbons also carried out the 1 April 2012 actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan on the same basis.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 139 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 139 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Company Accounts 28 Retirement benefits continued An alternative to the projected unit credit method is a valuation on a solvency basis, often estimated using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurance company.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the scheme.
The Group estimates that this would amount to 390m 2013: 370m.
2014 2013 2012 Key assumptions used UK schemes : Discount rate 4.40% 4.40% 5.00% Expected return on scheme assets 4.40% 5.33% 5.68% Expected rate of salary increases 3.20% 3.30% 3.20% Pension increases LPI 2.5% 2.20% 2.20% 2.25% Pension increases LPI 3.0% 2.50% 2.50% 2.75% Inflation RPI 3.20% 3.30% 3.20% Inflation CPI 2.20% 2.30% 2.45% Mortality assumptions: Investigations have been carried out within the past three years into the mortality experience of the Groups UK defined benefit schemes.
These investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in mortality rates.
The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are: 2014 2013 2012 Years Years Years Retiring today: Males 23.4 23.3 22.1 Females 25.9 25.8 24.9 Retiring in 20 years: Males 25.2 25.1 24.0 Females 27.9 27.8 26.8 Both the Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan have a baseline mortality assumption for 2014, 2013 and 2012 derived from the SN03 tables.
To reflect population characteristics a one year age deduction has been adopted for Halma but no adjustment was made for Apollo.
From 2013, a long-term improvement rate of 1.25% per annum was incorporated.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the UK scheme liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.5% Decrease increase by 10.7% Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.5% Increase decrease by 6.9% Rate of salary growth Increase decrease by 0.5% Increase decrease by 2.1% Rate of mortality Increase by one year Increase by 2.4% IAS 19 revised was applied from 31 March 2013, which affected the accounting for the defined benefit pension schemes.
In order to aid comparison, the results for the 52 weeks to 30 March 2013 have been restated as if IAS 19 revised had always applied during that year.
The effect of adopting IAS 19 revised was a net reduction to profit after tax of 1,610,000 for the year comprising: a an increase in administrative expenses of 1,070,000: b a decrease in the expected return on pension scheme assets of 1,048,000: and c a reduction in the tax charge of 508,000.
The corresponding entries to a and b were to actuarial gains and to c were to deferred tax taken to equity.

In conjunction with the trustees, the Group conducts asset-liability reviews for its defined benefit pension scheme.
The results of these reviews are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of the liabilities of the scheme.
They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the defined benefit deficit by providing information used to determine the schemes investment strategy.
As a consequence, the Group is progressively giving more emphasis to a closer return matching of scheme assets and liabilities, both to ensure the long-term security of our defined benefit commitment and to reduce earnings and balance sheet volatility.
