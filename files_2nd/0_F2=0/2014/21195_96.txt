IFRS Financial statements | A Aviva viva p plc lc A An nn nu ua al r l re ep po orrt a t an nd a d ac cc co ou un nt ts 2 s 20 01 14 4 181 181 29 Deferred acquisition costs, other assets, prepayments and accrued income continued The balance of deferred acquisition costs for long-term business remained broadly flat over 2014, as acquisition costs deferred during the year were offset by amortisation, the effect of assumption changes and exchange rate movements.
Assumption changes mainly reflect the announcement in March 2014 of a 0.75% charge cap for default funds and removal of active member discounts on auto-enrolment pension schemes in the UK.
Where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, changes to economic conditions may lead to a movement in the DAC balance and a corresponding impact on profit.
It is estimated that the movement in the DAC balance would reduce profit by 18 million 2013: 2 million if market yields on fixed income investments were to increase by 1% and increase profit by 31 million 2013: 8 million if yields were to reduce by 1%.
The sensitivity to yields on fixed interest investments has increased particularly in the UK.
As at 31 December 2014 the DAC balance has been restricted by the value of projected future profits.
This was not the case in prior periods, therefore the DAC balance is now more sensitive to changes in the value of those projected profits.
In the comparative period, the shadow adjustments related to deferred acquisition costs on business in the US backed by investments classified as available for sale AFS, movements in which were recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
c Other assets Other assets include 1 million 2013: 1 million that is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
d Prepayments and accrued income Prepayments and accrued income of 2,466 million 2013 restated: 2,635 million, includes 81 million 2013: 103 million that is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
