Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies The financial statements of the parent company have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
A summary of the more important accounting policies which have been applied consistently throughout the year are set out below.
Investments Investments are stated at historic cost less any provision for impairment in value and are held for long-term investment purposes.
Provisions are based upon an assessment of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that an impairment has occurred such as the performance and or prospects including the financial prospects of the investee company being significantly below the expectations on which the investment was based, a significant adverse change in the markets in which the investee company operates or a deterioration in general market conditions.
Intercompany loans All intercompany loans are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Where intercompany loans are intended for use on a continuing basis in the Companys activities, and there is no intention of their settlement in the foreseeable future, they are presented as fixed assets.
Impairment If there is an indication that an asset might be impaired, the Company will perform an impairment review.
An asset is impaired if the recoverable amount, being the higher of net realisable value and value in use, is less than its carrying amount.
Value in use is measured based on future discounted cash flows DCF attributable to the asset.
In such cases, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to recoverable amount with a corresponding charge recognised in the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments Currently the Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised and cease to be recognised on the basis of when the related titles pass to or from the Company.
