Strategic Report Directors Report Financial Results 28.
Share-based payments The Group operates two equity-settled share-based payment schemes.
a Fenner PLC 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme Share options were granted to certain employees within the Group.
The exercise price of options granted was set at the market price of the shares on the date of the grant.
The vesting period was generally 3 years.
If the options remained unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of the grant the options expired.
Options could only be exercised upon satisfaction of performance criteria.
This required that the overall growth of the Groups earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items over a consecutive three year period exceeded the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9%.
The last grant of shares under the Executive Share Option Scheme was made in November 2004.
Details of movements in outstanding share options are as follows: Weighted average Options share price number pence At 1 September 2013 20,406 123.5 Exercised during the year 20,406 123.5 At 31 August 2014 - - There are no options exercisable at 31 August 2014 2013: 20,406. b Performance Share Plan Conditional awards of shares are made to certain employees within the Group.
The conditional award is made to each employee at the start of a three year performance period and is based on a percentage of the basic annual salary of each employee.
The awards are subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria.
The proportion of the conditional share awards that vest is based on a combination of the Total Shareholder Return TSR measure and an earnings per share EPS measure.
The EPS measure accounts for 33% of the final allocation on vesting and the TSR measure for 67%.
The EPS performance target is set against underlying EPS growth in the Company measured over the three years from the end of the financial year preceding the year in which the award was made.
Details of movements in conditional awards under the Performance Share Plan are as follows: Shares number At 1 September 2012 1,260,198 Conditional awards during the year 433,782 Dividend roll up awards applied 36,041 Forfeited during the year 77,673 Final awards during the year 426,445 At 1 September 2013 1,225,903 Conditional awards during the year 374,727 Dividend roll up awards applied 35,558 Lapsed during the year 275,720 Final awards during the year 137,840 At 31 August 2014 1,222,628 Dividend roll ups have been applied since 2008 in line with the Performance Share Plan Rules.
