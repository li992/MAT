Earnings per Share continued At 31 December 2014 options over 1,477,411 2013: nil shares were excluded from the weighted average number of shares used for calculating diluted earnings per share because their exercise price was above the average share price for the year and they were, therefore, anti-dilutive.
A further 8.7m shares are potentially dilutive but are not included in the above calculation due to the loss making position in the year.

Part of this reorganisation led to the splitting of the Local Services CGU into several separate CGUs.
However, as the new Local Services CGUs all operate within similar markets, with similar drivers, the assumptions applied to these CGUs are the same and they continue to be disclosed here as a single group of CGUs.
The Germany CGU has been integrated within one of these new CGUs and as cash flows are no longer independent the goodwill has transferred across.
In addition, the expected sale of a significant portion of both the Global Services and Local Services CGUs results in the transfer of an element of the goodwill balance to held for sale.
As goodwill is not amortised, it is tested for impairment annually or if there are indications that it might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations derived from forecast cash flows based on past experience, adjusted to reflect market trends, economic conditions and key risks.
These forecasts include an appropriate level of new business wins and an assumption that the final year forecast continues on into perpetuity at a CGU specific growth rate.
In the current year, a material impairment of goodwill was noted during the review process, which arises as a result of two key issues.
Firstly, forecasts of cash flows have been significantly impacted by the strategy review undertaken during the year which has changed the outlook of the Group, and secondly, the discount rates applied in the impairment calculations have increased to reflect the changing level of risk associated with the business.
This level of risk is directly linked to the performance of the business following the impact of the UK Government review at the end of 2013.
Finally, as a result of the transfer of elements of the Global Services and Local Services goodwill balances to held for sale we have assessed the fair value of these balances and made any additional impairment charges as required.
The total impairment charge has been treated as exceptional and separated on the face of the income statement from the other results of the Group on the grounds that it is non-recurring in nature and outside of the normal course of the business.
A goodwill balance remains in the Healthcare CGU despite the exit from frontline clinical health services due to the positive cash flows from other parts of the CGU and expected levels of growth.

Goodwill continued Included above is the detail of the headroom on the CGUs existing at the year end.
For those CGUs which were impaired in the year, no headroom exists and therefore any reduction in forecasts or unfavourable movements in key assumptions would lead to an additional impairment.
Headroom shown in respect of the other CGUs reflects where future discounted cash flows are greater than the underlying assets and includes all relevant cash flows including where provisions have been made for future costs and losses.
The headroom in the Justice and Immigration CGU exists despite the future losses reflected in the onerous contract provisions seen in note 30 as a result of the CGU being in a net liability position.
This is due to the cash payments related to the onerous contract provisions being removed from the terminal year as they are not expected in perpetuity.
The key assumptions applied in the impairment review are set out below: Terminal Terminal Discount rate Discount rate growth rates growth rates 2014 2013 2014 2013 % % % % UK Central Government Justice and Immigration 9.2 9.1 1.9 2.2 Local and Regional Government Health 9.7 9.1 1.9 2.2 Local Services 9.7 9.1 1.9 2.2 Germany 8.6 2.0 Global Services 12.4 12.5 4.6 4.0 Americas 13.3 10.5 2.0 2.4 AsPac 12.4 10.4 2.3 3.0 Middle East 9.0 8.6 2.2 3.0 Discount Rate Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital have been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
These rates are reviewed annually with external advisors and are adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates.
The increases noted in the table above reflect the increased level of risk in the business, partly as a result of the decline in market capitalisation, and partly as a result of the increased level of risk perceived by the market in the business model.
The Global Services discount rate disclosed is a blended rate covering different geographic regions within the CGU and the decrease in the year reflects a change in mix of the expected cash flows.
Short-term Growth Rates The annual impairment test is performed immediately prior to the year end, based initially on five year cash flow forecasts approved by senior management.
Short-term revenue growth rates used in each CGU five year plan are based on internal data regarding our current contracted position, the pipeline of opportunities and forecast growth for the relevant market.
Short-term profitability and cash conversion is based on our historic experiences and a level of judgement is applied to expected changes in both.
Where businesses have been poor performers in recent history, turnaround has only been assumed where a detailed and achievable plan is in place and all forecasts include cash flows relating to contracts where onerous contract provisions have been made.
Terminal Growth Rates The calculations include a terminal value based on the projections for the fifth year of the short-term plan, with a growth rate assumption applied which extrapolates the business into perpetuity.
The terminal growth rates are based on long-term inflation rates of the geographic market in which the CGUs operate and therefore do not exceed the average long-term growth rates forecast for the individual markets.
These are provided by external sources.
The decrease in rates noted year on year are partly due to a fall in long-term inflation rates, and partly as a result of the Strategy Review.
Sensitivity Analysis Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and the Justice and Immigration, AsPac and Middle East CGUs are not impaired following any reasonably possible change in a key assumption.
Given the movements in the key assumptions in the current year, we have considered a 2% movement in discount rates and a 1% movement in terminal growth rates to be reasonably possible.
The removal of future revenues assumed in the impairment models have also been considered.
These are fully expected to be generated from future contract wins, but for the purpose of sensitivity analysis we have assumed that it is reasonably possible that half of these cash flows are not included.
