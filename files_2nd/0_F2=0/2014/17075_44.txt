Management has determined that no impairment was necessary for the current financial year 2013: nil.
All goodwill relates to the acquisitions of groups of retail stores and each CGU is sensitive to movements in the same key assumptions.
The key assumptions on which forecast three-year cash flows of the CGUs are based include sales growth, product mix and operating costs.
The values assigned to each of these assumptions were determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends within the Group, and external information on expected future trends in the UK retail industry.
These cash flows are extrapolated for an additional nine years representing the average length of the lease for the relevant group of stores based on long-term growth rates.
The long-term growth rates used are between 2.25 per cent and 2.5 per cent, reflecting expected retail price index growth.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is ten per cent pre-tax 2013: ten per cent.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management.
This included an increase in the discount rate of up to one per cent and a decrease in the longterm growth rate of up to one per cent.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would arise under each scenario.
All CGU value-in-use calculations are considered to have been valued using level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13, Fair value measurement.
On 31 January 2014, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Wild Retail Group Pty Limited, a company incorporated in Australia, for a cash consideration of 2m.
