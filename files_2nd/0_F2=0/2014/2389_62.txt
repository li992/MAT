Reconciliation of the effective tax rate The following table provides a reconciliation of the UK statutory corporation tax rate to the effective tax rate of the group on profit before taxation.
With effect from 1 April 2014 the UK statutory corporation tax rate reduced from 23% to 21% on profits arising from activities outside the North Sea.
For 2014, the items presented in the reconciliation are distorted as a result of the tax credits related to the impairment losses recognized in the year, and the effect of the impairment losses on the profit for the year.
In order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the effective tax rate for 2014, the table also presents separate reconciliations for the group excluding the effects of the impairment losses, and for the effects of the impairment losses in isolation.
For 2013 and 2012, the effective tax rate is not affected significantly by impairment losses.
See Note 3 for further information.
