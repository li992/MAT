16 Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objectives as stated on page 4.
In pursuing its investment objectives, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in either a reduction in its net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These financial risks comprising market price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit and counterparty risk, and the Directors approach to the management of these risks, are set out below and have not changed from the previous accounting period.
The Board and Henderson coordinate the Companys risk management and there are various risk management systems in place as detailed below.
Straight-through processing via a deal order and management system 'OMS' is utilised for listed securities, exchange-traded derivatives and OTC derivatives contracts with connectivity to third-party affirmation and trade repository services.
Portfolio modelling and investment management functions including order-raising, dealing and trade execution are performed using one of, or a combination of, the following third-party software applications: Charles River Development OMS and or Imagine.
Fund pricing and accounting services are outsourced to a third-party administrator currently BNP Paribas Securities Services which utilises Hiportfolio software.
52 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2014 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued The IT tools to which the Henderson risk, compliance and operations teams have access for independent monitoring and risk measurement purposes include: Charles River Compliance module for investment restrictions monitoring: Arc Logics operational risk database: Riskmetrics for VaR statistics, stress-testing and back-testing: UBS Delta, Style Research, Finanalytica and Barra Aegis for market risk measurement: Bloomberg for market data and price-checking: and Hiportfolio for portfolio holdings and valuations.
These are supplemented by in-house developments: derivatives risk and compliance database 'DRAC' and counterparty exposure 'CER' reports.
The Board determines the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and these are set out below under the relevant risk category.
The policies for the management of risk have not changed from the previous accounting period.
16.1 Market risk Henderson assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
1 Market price risk Market price risk ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the fair value of the quoted and unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board of Directors manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely reporting of relevant information from Henderson.
Investment performance is reviewed at each Board meeting.
The Board monitors Hendersons compliance with the Companys objectives, and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation, including as between countries and economies.
The Companys exposure to changes in market prices on its investments was asfollows: 2014 2013 000 000 Equities 685,414 654,933 Fixed interest 42 75 685,456 655,008 Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the Companys net assets to an increase ordecrease of 20% 2013: 20% in the fair values of the Companys investments at each statement of financial position date.
Thislevel of change is considered to be reasonable based on observation of current market conditions.

2 Currency risk A significant proportion of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and presentational currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk Henderson monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a regular basis and reports to the Board at each Board meeting.
Henderson measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and total return of a movement in the exchange rate to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings may be used to limit the Companys exposure to future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
These borrowings are limited to 20% of the adjusted net asset value.
Investment income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company did not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
During the year, derivative contracts were not used to hedge against exposure to currency risk.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 October are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
Hong US Japanese Kong $ Euro Yen $ Other 2014 000 000 000 000 000 Other receivables 242 13 721 70 357 Cash and cash equivalents 1 990 Current liabilities 860 2,788 Total foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 617 13 2,067 70 1,347 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 185,375 48,324 57,833 33,046 84,264 Total net foreign currency exposure 184,758 48,337 55,766 33,116 85,611 Hong US Japanese Kong $ Euro Yen $ Other 2013 000 000 000 000 000 Other receivables 87 14 378 1,911 Cash and cash equivalents 2 Current liabilities 331 Total foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 242 14 378 1,911 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 165,793 46,191 60,791 23,917 66,914 Total net foreign currency exposure 165,551 46,205 61,169 23,917 68,825 The above amounts are not necessarily representative of the exposure to risk during each year, as levels of monetary foreign currency exposure change significantly throughout the year.
Foreign currency sensitivity The table opposite illustrates the sensitivity of the total profit after tax for the year and the net assets in regard to movements in the Companys foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities caused by changes in the exchange rates for the US dollar sterling, euro sterling, Japanese yen sterling and Hong Kong dollar sterling.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US dollar sterling - 10% 2013: 10%.
54 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2014 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.1.
2 Currency risk continued These percentages are deemed reasonable based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in recent years.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities held at each statement of financial position date, with all other variables held constant.
The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of a depreciation of 10% in the year end exchange rate for sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2014 2013 Hong Hong US Japanese Kong US Japanese Kong $ Euro Yen $ $ Euro Yen $ 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 455 121 105 101 363 124 104 105 Capital return 20,564 5,361 6,416 3,666 18,392 5,124 6,744 2,653 Change to profit after tax for the year and net assets 21,019 5,482 6,521 3,767 18,755 5,248 6,848 2,758 The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of an appreciation of 10% in the year end exchange rate for sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2014 2013 Hong Hong US Japanese Kong US Japanese Kong $ Euro Yen $ $ Euro Yen $ 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 210 99 86 83 297 102 85 86 Capital return 16,825 4,385 5,249 2,999 15,048 4,192 5,518 2,171 Change to profit after tax for the year and net assets 17,035 4,485 5,335 3,082 15,345 4,294 5,603 2,257 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of interest receivable from cash at bank, the current asset investment and the value of the fixed interest investments.
Management of the risk The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
55 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2014 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.1.
3 Interest rate risk continued Interest rate exposure T he exposure at 31 October of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown below.
For floating interest rates exposure is by reference to when the interest rate is due to be re-set.
2014 2013 More More Within than one Within than one one year year Total one year year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and cash equivalents 5,023 5,023 14,130 14,130 Current asset investment 3,896 3,896 21 21 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Fixed interest investments 42 42 75 75 Bank loans 2,788 2,788 Debentures 25,000 25,000 25,000 25,000 6,131 24,958 18,827 14,151 24,925 10,774 The above amounts are not necessarily representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made, and borrowings are drawn down and repaid.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2013: same.
Interest paid on debentures is set out in note 7.
Interest rate sensitivity The Company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its cash balances, its current asset investment, fixed income investment portfolio and bank loans.
The sensitivity of each exposure is as follows: Cash Cash balances vary throughout the year.
Cash balances at the year end were 5,023,000 2013: 14,130,000 and, if that level of cash was maintained for a full year, a 100 basis points change in LIBOR up or down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 50,000 2013: 141,000.
Current asset investment sensitivity The Companys interest bearing current asset investment at the year end was 3,896,000 2013: 21,000 and, if that level of investment was maintained for a full year, a 100 basis points change in interest rates up or down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 39,000 2013: 210.
Fixed income investment sensitivity The Companys fixed income portfolio at the year end was valued at 42,000 2013:75,000, and is not currently paying interest and therefore there is no modified duration interest rate sensitivity 2013: no modified duration.
Loan sensitivity Borrowings vary throughout the year as a result of the Companys borrowing policy.
Borrowings at the year end were 2,788,000 2013: nil note 14 and, if that level of borrowings was maintained for a full year, then a 100 basis point change in LIBOR up or down would decrease or increase the total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 28,000 2013:nil.
16.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Company has a multi-currency loan facility of 30,000,000 with Commonwealth Bank of Australia 2013: 30,000,000 and an overdraft facility with the custodian, the extent of which is determined by the custodian on a regular basis by reference to the value of the securities held by it on behalf of the Company.
The facilities are subject to regular review.
The Company also has two debentures, details of which can be found in note 15 on page 52.
The Board gives guidance to Henderson as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
56 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2014 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.2 Liquidity risk continued The policy is that the Company should generally remain fully invested and that short-term borrowings be used to manage short-term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 October, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required was as follows: 2014 2013 Due between Due between Due within three months Due after Due within three months Due after three months and one year one year three months and one year one year 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stocks 2,250 35,650 2,250 37,900 Bank loans 2,788 Other payables 2,076 8,398 4,864 2,250 35,650 8,398 2,250 37,900 16.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk Credit risk is managed as follows: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of approved brokers, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by Henderson, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: and cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings and is subject to continual review.
Stock lending transactions are carried out with a number of approved counterparties, whose credit-standard is reviewed by Henderson and limits are set on the amount that may be lent to any one counterparty.
Stock lending is the temporary transfer of securities by a lender to a borrower, with an agreement by the borrower to return equivalent securities to the lender at an agreed future date.
Stock lending revenue is received for making the investments available to the borrower which increases the returns on the portfolio.
In all cases securities lent continue to be recognised on the statement of financial position.
Details of the value of the securities on loan at the year end, and the collateral held can be found in note 4 on page 48.
Other than stock lending transactions, none of the Companys financial assets or liabilities is secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Outstanding settlements are subject to credit risk.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Company through its decision to transact with counterparties of high credit quality.
The Company only buys and sells investments through brokers which are approved counterparties, thus minimising the risk of default during settlement.
The credit ratings of brokers are reviewed periodically by Henderson, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
The Company is also exposed to credit risk through the use of banks for its cash position.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of banks may cause the Companys rights with respect to cash held by banks to be delayed or limited.
The Companys cash balances are held by its custodian, BNP Paribas Securities Services.
The Directors believe the counterparty is of high credit quality and therefore, the Company has minimal exposure to credit risk.

The par value of thedebenture stocks can be found in note 15.
The fair values are calculated using prices quoted on the exchange on which the instruments trade.
16.5 Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table below sets out the fair value measurements using the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
There were no transfers during the year between any of the levels.
A reconciliation of fair value movements within Level 3 is set out below 2014 2013 Level 3 investments at fair value through profit or loss 000 000 Opening balance 75 179 Disposal proceeds 48 96 Total gains losses included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on assets held at year end 15 8 42 75 The total value of unquoted investments as at 31 October 2014 was 42,000 2013: 75,000.
The total carrying value of loans and receivables, as stated in notes 13 and 14, is a reasonable approximation of their fair value as at the year end date.
The total carrying value of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost as disclosed in note 15 is a reasonable approximation of their fair value as at the year end date.
