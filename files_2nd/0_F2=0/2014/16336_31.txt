Introduction 112 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 31 Retirement benefit schemes Some UK employees of the Group are members of the Ultra Electronics Limited defined benefit scheme which was established on 1 March 1994.
The scheme is a final salary scheme with the majority of members accruing 1 60th of their final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
The scheme was closed to new members in 2003.
A new defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2013.
The Group also operates two defined contribution schemes for overseas employees.
In addition to these schemes, the Groups Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has three defined benefit schemes and the Swiss business of the acquired Forensic Technology group has a defined benefit scheme.
Defined contribution schemes The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was 4,696,000 2013: 4,916,000.
Defined benefit schemes All the defined benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2014 using the projected unit method.
In the UK, Ultra Electronics Limited sponsors the Ultra Electronics Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit pension scheme.
The scheme is administered within a trust which is legally separate from the Company.
Trustees are appointed by both the Company and the schemes membership and act in the interest of the scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the Company.
The Trustees are also responsible for the investment of the schemes assets.
This scheme provides pensions and lump sums to members on retirement and to their dependants on death.
Members who leave service before retirement are entitled to a deferred pension.
Active members of the scheme pay contributions via salary sacrifice and the Company pays the balance of the cost as determined by regular actuarial valuations.
The Trustees are required to use prudent assumptions to value the liabilities and costs of the scheme whereas the accounting assumptions must be best estimates.
Responsibility for making good any deficit within the scheme lies with the Company and this introduces a number of risks for the Company.
The major risks are: interest rate risk: inflation risk: investment risk and longevity risk.
The Company and Trustees are aware of these risks and manage them through appropriate investment and funding strategies.
The Trustees manage governance and operational risks through a number of internal controls policies, including a risk register.
The scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years.
The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 6 April 2013.
The next actuarial valuation is due to be carried out with an effective date of 6 April 2016.
These actuarial valuations are carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include deliberate margins for prudence.
This contrasts with these accounting disclosures, which are determined using best estimate assumptions.
The results of the 6 April 2013 valuation have been projected to 31 December 2014 by a qualified independent actuary.
The figures in the following disclosure were measured using the Projected Unit Method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows: UK Canada Switzerland UK Canada 2014 2014 2014 2013 2013 Discount rate 3.65% 3.65% 1.50% 4.45% 4.45% Inflation rate RPI 3.05% 3.05% 1.40% 3.40% 3.40% Inflation rate CPI 2.05% 2.05% 1.40% 2.40% n a Expected rate of salary increases 3.30% 3.30% 1.00% 3.90% 3.90% Future pension increases pre 6 4 08 2.85% 3.05% 1.40% 3.10% 3.40% Future pension increases post 6 4 08 1.90% n a n a 2.00% n a For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values.
Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
For the UK scheme, a 0.1% increase in the inflation assumption to 3.15% and a 0.1% decrease in the discount rate to 3.55% would increase the schemes liabilities by 1.8% and 1.9% respectively.
If the members life expectancy were to increase by 1 year, the scheme liabilities would increase by 3.6%.
The average duration of the scheme liabilities is 19 years 2013: 19 years.
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners.
Due to the size of the scheme the mortality rates were based on standard tables, namely: Current pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA 105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002 Future pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA 105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002 The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the UK scheme make appropriate allowance for future improvements in longevity and are set out below: 2014 2013 Current pensioners at 65 males 22 years 22 years Current pensioners at 65 females 24 years 24 years Future pensioners at 65 males 24 years 24 years Future pensioners at 65 females 26 years 26 years Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 113 Notes to accounts Group continued 31 Retirement benefit schemes continued Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes were as follows: UK Canada Switzerland Total UK Canada Total 2014 2014 2014 2014 2013 2013 2013 m m m m m m m Current service cost 4.9 0.1 0.1 5.1 4.7 0.1 4.8 Administration expenses 0.5 0.1 - 0.6 0.6 0.3 0.9 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 12.0 0.4 - 12.4 11.0 0.5 11.5 Expected return on pension scheme assets 8.4 0.4 - 8.8 7.7 0.4 8.1 Loss on settlements ---- - 0.3 0.3 9.0 0.2 0.1 9.3 8.6 0.8 9.4 Of the current service cost for the year, 3.8 million 2013: 3.7 million has been included in cost of sales, and 1.3 million 2013: 1.1 million has been included in administrative expenses.

34 Non-controlling interests The following table summarises the information, before any intra-group eliminations, relating to the Groups subsidiary Ultra Electronics in Collaboration with Oman Investment Corporation, incorporated in the Sultanate of Oman, that has a material non-controlling interest held by Oman Investment Corporation OIC.
The Group is currently in negotiations with OIC to determine the future obligations in light of the loss recognised following the termination of the Airport IT contract see note 36.

The nature of much of the contracting work performed by the Group means that there are occasional contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise in the ordinary course of business.
In addition, as set out in note 36, the Oman Airport IT contract has been terminated.
There is significant uncertainty regarding the likely outcome of negotiations regarding this event.
The Group is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
36 Post balance sheet events Oman Airport IT contract termination Confirmation of the termination of the Oman Airport IT contract was received on 9 February 2015.
The termination event related to conditions already in existence at the balance sheet date and consequently the termination is considered to be an adjusting post balance sheet event for 2014 in accordance with IAS 10.
There is significant uncertainty regarding the likely outcome of negotiations with the Sultanate of Oman, Ministry of Transport & Communications, over the timing of receipt of any agreed settlement, or whether agreement can be reached without the need to enter a formal arbitration or judicial process.
Consequently, a number of significant judgements and estimates are required with respect to matters arising due to the termination event.
Revenue has been recognised, in accordance with group policy, to the extent of work performed that it is probable will be recovered at the time.
Trade debtors and amounts recoverable on contracts have been assessed for recoverability and allowances made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Specific provisions have been booked to cover estimated legal costs and all known liabilities where the group has assessed it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Material items have been disclosed separately within the financial statements.
Disclosure is provided on the consolidated income statement and in note 2 regarding the 46.9m termination cost, comprising the 37.2m provision charge booked against contract receivables balances see note 19 and other termination provisions of 9.7m see note 26.
