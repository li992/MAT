To determine the quality of the market data inputs, factors such as independence, relevance, reliability, availability of multiple data sources and methodology employed by the pricing provider are taken into consideration.
Formal committees for the business clusters, consisting of representatives from Group Market Risk, Product Control, Valuation Control and the Business meet monthly to discuss and approve the valuations of the inventory.
The Principal Finance Valuation Committee meetings are held on aquarterly basis.
The business cluster valuation committees fall under the Valuation Benchmarks Committee as part of the valuation governance structure.
Valuation hierarchy Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classied into three levels according to the observability of the significant inputs used to determine the fair values.

The methodology to calculate the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves netting between long and short Loans and advances positions and the grouping of risk by strike and tenor based on the hedging strategy.
Where long positions are marked to bid and short positions These include loans in the global syndications underwriting book which are not syndicated yet.
These loans are generally bilateral in nature and marked to offer in the systems, for example for cash securities, no bid offer valuation adjustments are required.
their valuation is primarily based on recent trades or proxies, such as comparable loans with similar credit grade, sector, etc.
Products are Credit adjustments classied as Level 2 in cases where observable credit spreads applicable to those products are available.
Where there are no recent transactions The Group makes a credit adjustment CA against derivative products.
CA is an estimate of the adjustment to fair value to account for the and reliable comparable loans to proxy from, the valuation of these loans is based on unobservable inputs resulting in them being classied as possibility that the counterparty may default and the Group would not receive the full market value of the transactions.
Advanced internal Level 3. ratings-based approach AIRB models are used to calculate the probability of default PD and the loss given default LGD which, together with Debt securities asset backed securities the results of the exposure simulation engine, generates a view of expected losses.
Collateral positions are taken into account for the calculation Due to the lack of liquidity in the market and the prolonged period of time under which many securities have not traded, obtaining external prices of CA.
is not a strong enough measure to determine whether an asset has an observable price or not.
Therefore, once external pricing has been veried, Own credit adjustments an assessment is made whether each security is traded with significant liquidity based on its credit rating and sector.
If a security is of high credit With the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 13, the Group calculates own credit adjustments to reect changes in its rating and is traded in a liquid sector, it will be classied as Level 2, otherwise it will be classied as Level 3.
Where third-party pricing is not own credit standing.
The Groups own credit adjustments are calculated on its derivative liabilities and issued debt designated at fair value, available, the valuation of the security will be estimated from market standard cash ow models with input parameter assumptions which include including structured notes.
The Groups own credit adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if its credit prepayment speeds, default rates, discount margins derived from comparable securities with similar vintage, collateral type, and credit ratings.
The Groups own credit adjustments will reverse over time as its liabilities mature.
These securities are also classied as Level 3.
For derivative liabilities, an own credit adjustment is determined by applying the Groups PD to the Groups negative expected exposure against Other debt securities the counterparty.
The Groups PD and loss expected in the event of default is derived based on internally assessed credit ratings and market These debt securities include convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit and structured notes.
Where quoted prices are available through pricing standard recovery levels.
The expected exposure is modelled based on simulation methodology and is generated through simulation of vendors, brokers or observable trading activities from liquid markets, these are classied as Level 2.
Where there are significant valuation inputs underlying risk factors over the life of the deal booked against the particular counterparty.
This simulation methodology incorporates the collateral which are unobservable in the market, due to illiquid trading or the complexity of the product, these are classied as Level 3.
The valuation of posted by the Group and the effects of master netting agreements.

reference to the same issuer if available or proxied from comparable issuers or assets.
For issued debt and structured notes designated at fair value, an own credit adjustment is determined by discounting the contractual cash ows Equity shares Private Equity using a yield curve adjusted for market observed secondary senior debt issuance spreads above average interbank rates.
The majority of private equity investments are valued based on earning multiples price-to-earnings P E or enterprise value to earning before income tax, depreciation and amortisation EV EBITDA ratios of comparable listed companies.
The two primary inputs for the valuation of these Model valuation adjustments investments are the actual or forecast earnings of the investee companies and earning multiples for the comparable listed companies.
In Valuation models may have pricing deficiencies or limitations that require a valuation adjustment.
These pricing deficiencies or limitations arise circumstances where an investment does not have direct comparables or where the multiples for the comparable companies cannot be sourced due to the choice, implementation and calibration of the pricing model.
from reliable external sources, alternate valuation techniques for example, discounted cash ow models, which use predominantly unobservable Funding valuation adjustments inputs or Level 3 inputs, may be applied.
Even though earning multiples for the comparable listed companies can be sourced from third-party In general, uncollateralised derivatives are discounted on the assumption that the Group is able to fund at Libor.
However, the Groups funding sources for example, Bloomberg, and those inputs can be deemed Level 2 inputs, all unlisted investments excluding those where observable costs will differ with reference to Libor by a funding spread.
Funding valuation adjustment accounts for the impact of this funding spread in the inputs are available, for example, over-the-counter prices are classied as Level 3 on the grounds that the valuation methods involve judgements valuation of derivatives.
Funding valuation adjustment is reserved as part of day one profit and loss review process and released over the life ranging from determining comparable companies to discount rates where the discounted cash ow method is applied.
Derivatives Day one profit and loss Derivative products are classied as Level 2 if the valuation of the product is based upon input parameters which are observable from A financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value, which is generally its transaction price.
In cases where the value obtained from the independent and reliable market data sources.
Derivative products are classied as Level 3 if there are significant valuation input parameters relevant valuation model differs from the transaction price, we record the asset or liability based on our valuation model, but do not recognise that which are unobservable in the market, such as products where the performance is linked to more than one underlying.
Examples are foreign initial difference in profit and loss, unless the inputs to the valuation model are observable.
exchange basket options, equity options based on the performance of two or more underlying indices and interest rate products with quanto payouts.
These unobservable correlation parameters could only be implied from the market, through methods such as historical analysis and comparison to historical levels or benchmark data.
Debt securities in issue These debt securities relate to structured notes issued by the Group.
These positions are classied as Level 2 where independent market data is available through pricing vendors and brokers.
Where such liquid external prices are not available, valuation of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads and classied as Level 3.
These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer if available or proxied from comparable issuers or assets.
