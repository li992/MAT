This assumption also applies to demand deposits, savings accounts without aspecifi c maturity and variable rate fi financial instruments.
Financial instruments for which fair value does not approximate carrying value Fixed rate fi financial instruments The fair value of fi xed rate fi financial assets and fi financial liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing market interest rates when they were fi first recognised with current market rates offered for similar fi financial instruments.
The estimated fair value of fi xed interest-bearing deposits is based on discounted cash fl ows using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity.
For quoted debt issued, the fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
For those notes issued where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash fl ow model is used based on a current interest yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.

Other debt securities Priced with reference to similar trades in an observable market as well as calculation of the present value of future cash fl ows, discounted as appropriate.
Loans and advances to customers Calculation of the present value of future cash fl ows, discounted as appropriate.
Own originated loans and advances Calculation of the current cash fl ows of fi xed rate loans at current expected to customers securitised interestrates.

Other securitised assets Calculated using a model based on future cash fl ows.
Deposits by banks Calculation of fair value using appropriate funding rates.

Repurchase agreements and cash Calculation of the present value of future cash fl ows, discounted as appropriate.
collateral on securities lent Customer accounts deposits Where the deposits are short term in nature carrying amounts are assumed to approximate fair value.
Where deposits are of longer-term maturities they are valued using a cash fl ow model, discounted as appropriate.
Debt securities in issue Where the debt securities are fully collateralised fair value is equal to the carrying value.
Other debt securities are valued using a cash fl ow model, discounted as appropriate to the securities for funding and interest rates.
Liabilities arising on securitisation of Valued using a cash fl ow model taking into account any hedging, discounted as other assets appropriate.
