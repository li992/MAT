Governance 105 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Vesting of the 2012 award The LTIP awards that were made in 2012, with a three-year performance period that ended on 31 December 2014, were reviewed by the Committee in February 2015 against the equally weighted relative Total Shareholder Return TSR and Return on Capital Employed ROCE performance conditions.
Maximum performance was achieved against the TSR targets and ROCE targets.
100% of the shares under award therefore vested in March 2015.
Awards granted in 2014 The maximum award that can be made to any LTIP participant in any year is equal to two times salary.
For 2014, the award made to David Hathorn was 185% of salary and the awards made to Andrew King and Peter Oswald were 130% of salary.
For the LTIP awards made in 2014, the performance conditions are based on two performance measures of equal weight relative TSR and ROCE, measured over a threeyear performance period ending on 31 December 2016.
The Committee believes that this combination of metrics provides an appropriate means of aligning the operation of the LTIP with shareholders interests and the Groups business strategy.
The TSR performance condition is based on the Groups TSR relative to a group of competitor companies.
For the 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 LTIP awards, the following group of companies were selected: 1 Amcor 2013 Mets Board 1 2 Bemis 2013 Norske Skog 2011, 2012 Billerud Portucel DS Smith Sappi 3 Domtar SCA 2011 Holmen Smurfit Kappa International Paper Stora Enso Mayr-Melnhof UPM MeadWestvaco 1 As previously reported, Amcor and Bemis were added to the peer group for 2013 and subsequent awards.
2 As previously reported, Norske Skog was excluded from the peer group for 2013 and subsequent awards.
3 SCA was removed from the peer group for 2012 and subsequent awards following the acquisition of SCA Packaging by DS Smith.
For the 50% of awards attributable to TSR: If the Groups TSR is below the median when ranked against the comparator group, this part of the award will lapse in full.
For TSR at the median, 25% of this part of the award i. e. 12.5% of the total award will vest, with a straight-line progression to the upper quartile, at which point 100% of this part of the award i. e. 50% of the total award will vest.
For the 50% of awards attributable to ROCE: This part will lapse in full if ROCE is below 10%.
25% of this part of the award i. e. 12.5% of the total award will vest for achievement of ROCE of 10%, with a straight-line progression to full vesting of this part of the award for achievement of ROCE of 16% i. e. 50% of the total award.
