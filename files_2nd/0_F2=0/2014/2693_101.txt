The main provisions we hold are for redundancies, asset retirement obligations and claims for legal matters.

Property Provision has been made for dilapidation costs and for the lower of the best estimate of the unavoidable lease payments or cost of exit in respect of vacant properties.
Unavoidable lease payments represent the diff erence between the rentals due and any income expected to be derived from the vacant properties being sublet.
The provision is expected to be used over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.
Redundancy Provision has been made for the total employee related costs of redundancies announced prior to the reporting date.
Amounts provided for and spent during the periods presented primarily relate to regional transformation activities in the Caribbean together with costs at the corporate centre note 2.3.
The provision is expected to be used within one year.
Network and asset retirement obligations Provision has been made for the best estimate of the unavoidable costs associated with redundant leased network capacity.
Provision has also been made for the best estimate of the asset retirement obligation associated with offi ce sites, technical sites, mobile cell sites, domestic and sub-sea cabling.
This provision is expected to be used at the end of the life of the related asset on which the obligation arises.
Legal and other Legal and other provisions include amounts relating to speci c legal claims against the Group together with amounts in respect of certain employee bene ts and sales taxes.
The timing of the utilisation of the provision is uncertain and is largely outside the Groups control, for example, where matters are contingent upon litigation.
