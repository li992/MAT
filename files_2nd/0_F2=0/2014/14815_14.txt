The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by i the revaluation of available for sale financial assets and ii financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the presentation currency of the Group, and the functional currency of the Company and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand 0.1m except where otherwise indicated.
New accounting standards adopted during the year The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 May 2013, but do not have any significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group: Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements Presentation of items of other comprehensive income IFRS 13, Fair value measurement Amendments to IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities Annual improvements to IFRS, 2011 IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment revised 2012 The Group has adopted early the amendment to IAS 36, on the disclosure of the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units containing goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
This does not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
In June 2011, the International Accounting Standards Board IASB issued an amended version of IAS 19 Employee Benefits, which brings in various changes relating to the recognition and measurement of post-retirement defined benefit expense and termination benefits, and to the disclosures for all employee benefits.
The IAS 19 change that has the most significant effect on the Groups reported profit is that the Groups annual expense for defined benefit schemes now includes net interest expense or income calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit asset or liability.
This net interest expense or income replaces the finance charge on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets and results in a higher annual expense.
Applying IAS 19R to the consolidated financial statements had no impact on revenue or the consolidated statement of cash flows previously reported.
Its impact on the segmental operating profit and profit from continuing operations was as follows: Year ended 30 April: 2013 2013 2013 2012 2012 2012 Effect of Effect of Reported applying new Restated Reported applying new Restated profit IAS 19 profit profit IAS 19 profit m m m m m m Operating Profit UK Bus regional operations 165.0 21.8 143.2 198.6 16.1 182.5 UK Bus London 21.9 2.9 19.0 13.5 4.3 9.2 North America 13.3 0.1 13.4 19.7 0.2 19.9 Total bus continuing operations 200.2 24.6 175.6 231.8 20.2 211.6 UK Rail 49.9 8.7 41.2 27.9 7.1 20.8 Total continuing operations 250.1 33.3 216.8 259.7 27.3 232.4 Group overheads 14.9 0.8 15.7 9.8 0.5 10.3 Intangible asset expenses 15.1 15.1 9.1 9.1 Restructuring costs 1.7 1.7 2.3 2.3 Total operating profit of continuing Group companies 218.4 34.1 184.3 238.5 27.8 210.7 Share of joint ventures profit after finance income and taxation 17.0 1.5 15.5 24.4 1.8 22.6 Total operating profit: Group operating profit and share of joint ventures profit after taxation 235.4 35.6 199.8 262.9 29.6 233.3 Non-operating exceptional items 2.2 2.2 11.6 11.6 Profit before interest and taxation 233.2 35.6 197.6 274.5 29.6 244.9 Finance charges net 37.4 5.9 43.3 34.7 0.2 34.9 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 195.8 41.5 154.3 239.8 29.8 210.0 Taxation 37.0 9.2 27.8 51.5 7.2 44.3 Profit from continuing operations 158.8 32.3 126.5 188.3 22.6 165.7 Adjusted earnings per share pence 30.2p 5.6 p 24.6p 25.4p 3.6 p 21.8p The restated profit shown above, reflects: The inclusion of the pensions current service cost within the operating profit of each division in the consolidated income statement.

The determination of those amounts includes considering the expected return on assets in the relevant sections over the life of the related franchises.
The new version of IAS 19 in effect applies a lower expected return on assets and so, results in a change in the liability recognised for the relevant sections of the Railways Pension Scheme.
The consolidated balance sheets as at 30 April 2013 and 30 April 2012 have been restated as follows: 2013 2013 2013 2012 2012 2012 Previously Effect of Restated net Previously Effect of Restated net reported net applying new liabilities reported net applying new liabilities liabilities IAS 19 assets liabilities IAS 19 assets m m m m m m Interests in joint ventures 50.3 3.0 53.3 56.6 1.2 57.8 Net retirement benefit liability 157.8 48.2 109.6 122.1 45.3 76.8 Deferred tax liabilities 24.4 11.1 35.5 40.0 11.7 51.7 Other net assets 108.1 108.1 48.2 48.2 Net liabilities assets 23.8 40.1 16.3 57.3 34.8 22.5 New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and therefore after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards and Interpretations Effective date IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2014 Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations 1 January 2016 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2014 Amendments to IFRS 10, 11 and 12 on transition guidance 1 January 2014 IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts from customers 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 1 January 2016 IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2014 IAS 28 revised 2011 Associates and Joint Ventures 1 January 2014 Amendment to IAS 32 Financial instruments: Presentation, on offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 1 January 2014 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Hedge accounting no effective date set IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: employee contributions 1 July 2014 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 1 July 2014 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2013 1 July 2014 IAS 39 amendment Financial Instruments: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting 1 January 2014 IFRIC 21 Levies 1 January 2014 Not yet adopted for use in the European Union.
With the exception of IFRS 15 that was only recently issued, the Directors have reviewed the requirements of the new standards and interpretations listed above and they are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Comparatives Where appropriate, comparative figures for the previous year have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation.
These changes have no impact on the consolidated income statement or on consolidated net liabilities.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures made up to 30 April in each year.
The consolidated income statement includes the results of businesses purchased from the effective date of acquisition and excludes the results of disposed operations and businesses sold from the effective date of disposal.
Subsidiaries and joint ventures i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries, which are those entities in which the Group has an interest of more than one half of the voting rights or otherwise has power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from their activities, are consolidated.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method also known as the acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries and other businesses.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given up, shares issued or liabilities undertaken at the date of acquisition.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
Costs attributable to the acquisition are expensed to the consolidated income statement.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
page 68 | Stagecoach Group plc 108244 STC Back PRINT 108244 STC Back V12 03 07 2014 16:05 Page 69 Note 1 IFRS accounting policies continued Subsidiaries and joint ventures continued ii Joint ventures Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method of accounting, the Groups consolidated income statement includes the Groups share of profits less losses of joint ventures, while the share of net assets of joint ventures is included in the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
Where the Groups cumulative share of losses in a joint venture exceeds its interest in that enterprise, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
The Groups reported interest in joint ventures includes goodwill on acquisition.
The Group applies its own accounting policies and estimates when accounting for its share of joint ventures making appropriate adjustments where necessary, having due regard to all relevant factors.
Presentation of income statement and exceptional items Where applicable, income statement information has been presented in a columnar format, which separately highlights intangible asset expenses and exceptional items.
This is intended to enable users of the financial statements to determine more readily the impact of intangible asset expenses and exceptional items on the results of the Group.
Exceptional items are defined in note 35.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs as adopted by the EU requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period.
Although these estimates and assumptions are based on managements best knowledge, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates and assumptions used.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement of tax assets and liabilities, the measurement of contract provisions, the measurement of retirement benefit amounts, the measurement of liabilities for litigation, the measurement and impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets, the measurement of insurance provisions and the measurement of receivables and payables in relation to rail contracts.
The measurement of tax assets and liabilities requires an assessment to be made of the potential tax consequence of certain items that will only be resolved when agreed by the relevant tax authorities.
The measurement of contract provisions requires estimates of future cash flows relating to the relevant contracts and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The measurement of retirement benefit amounts requires the estimation of life expectancies, future changes in salaries, inflation and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The measurement of liabilities in respect of litigation involves estimating the financial effects of uncertain litigation.
The Group determines whether goodwill arising on business combinations is impaired on an annual basis and this requires the estimation of value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
This requires estimation of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The estimation of the insurance provisions is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but for which claims have not been reported to the Group.
The estimation of receivables and payables in relation to rail contracts requires an estimate of the likely outcomes based on interpreting the applicable contracts.
Those accounting policies that the Directors believe require the greatest exercise of judgement are described in section 2.6.
14 of this Annual Report, which forms part of these financial statements.
Revenue Revenue represents gross revenue earned from public transport services and excludes payments received on account.
Amounts receivable for tendered services and concessionary fare schemes are included as part of revenue.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and VAT.
Revenues incidental to the Groups principal activity including advertising income and maintenance income are reported as miscellaneous revenue.
Rail revenue includes amounts attributable to the train operating companies, based principally on agreed models of route usage, by Railway Settlement Plan Limited which administers the income allocation system within the UK rail industry in respect of passenger receipts.
Franchise agreement receipts or payments from or to the UKs Department for Transport are treated as operating costs or other operating income.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as a proportion of total services to be provided.
Cash received for the sale of season tickets and travelcards is deferred within liabilities and recognised in the income statement over the period covered by the relevant ticket.
Income from advertising and other activities is recognised as the income is earned.
Finance income is recognised using the effective interest method as interest accrues.
Under the contractual terms of its franchise agreements to operate rail services, the Group has revenue sharing arrangements with the DfT.
As a result of these arrangements, the Group may be liable to make payments to the DfT or receive amounts from the DfT based on calculations that involve comparison of actual revenue with the target revenue specified in the relevant franchise agreement.
The Group recognises revenue share amounts payable or receivable in the income statement in the same period in which it recognises the related revenue.
Revenue share amounts payable or receivable if any are treated as operating costs or other operating income.
The Group receives Bus Service Operators Grant BSOG which is essentially a rebate of fuel tax.
BSOG is recognised within operating costs as part of the net fuel costs of the Group.
Performance incentive payments Performance incentive payments received from or made to Network Rail by the Group in respect of train service delivery are recognised in the same period that the performance relates to and are treated as operating costs or other operating income.
Government grants Grants from government are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.
Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the income statement over the period necessary to match them with the costs they are intended to compensate.
Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are recorded as liabilities and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets.
Amounts are held as deferred grant income within trade and other payables.
Revenue grants receivable and franchise premia amounts payable in respect of the operation of rail franchises in the UK are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the related revenue or expenditure is recognised in the income statement or where they do not relate to any specific revenue or expenditure, in the period in respect of which the amount is receivable or payable.
These premia payments and rail franchise grants are classified within operating costs and other operating income.

Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market based vesting conditions and no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest as a result of a failure to satisfy a non-market based vesting condition.
None of the Groups equity-settled transactions have any market based performance conditions.
Fair value for equity-settled share based payments is determinable from the Companys quoted share price at the time of the award.
At each balance sheet date, before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated based on managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest taking into consideration the likelihood of achieving non-market based vesting conditions.
The movement in this cumulative expense is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled by the Group or the holder, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Cash-settled transactions The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value.
Fair value is estimated initially at the grant date and at each balance sheet date thereafter until the awards are settled.
Market based performance conditions are taken into account when determining fair value.
Fair value for cash-settled share based payments being only those that relate to the Long Term Incentive Plan is estimated by use of a simulation model.
During the vesting period, a liability is recognised representing the estimated fair value of the award and the portion of the vesting period expired as at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the carrying amount of the liability are recognised in the income statement for the period.
Choice of settlement The Company can choose to settle awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan in either cash or equity, although it currently expects to settle all such awards in cash.
Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are accounted for as cash-settled transactions see above.
Employment taxes Liabilities are recognised for employment taxes principally, employers national insurance liabilities payable by the Group on share based payments.
The liability for employment taxes is calculated at the balance sheet date with reference to the fair value of the related share based payments at that date.
In the case of cash-settled share based payments, the fair value is the pre-tax amount recorded in the balance sheet.
Movements in the liabilities for employment taxes on share based payments are charged or credited to the income statement.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs and after the share of after-tax results of joint ventures but before finance income, finance costs, non-operating exceptional items, taxation and profit from discontinued operations.
Taxation Tax, current and deferred, is calculated using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
Corporation tax is provided on taxable profit at the current rate applicable.
Tax charges and credits are accounted for through the same primary statement as the related pre-tax item.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred income tax is measured at tax rates that are expected to apply in periods in which the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and law enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of operating segments, which for this purpose has been identified as the Board of Directors.
Foreign currency translation The financial statements of foreign operations are maintained in the functional currencies in which the entities transact business.
The trading results of foreign operations are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into sterling using rates of exchange at the relevant balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of the opening net assets and results of foreign operations, together with exchange differences arising on net foreign currency borrowings and foreign currency derivatives, to the extent they hedge the Groups investment in foreign operations, are recognised as a separate component of equity being the translation reserve.
Further information on the Groups accounting policy on hedges of net investments in a foreign entity is provided on page 74.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the respective functional currencies of the Group entities at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss.
On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the amount of any exchange differences relating to the subsidiary that has been deferred in the translation reserve is recognised in the income statement within the reported gain or loss on disposal.

Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given for a business over the fair value of such net assets.
The fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill and acquired customer contract provisions on the acquisition of a business are amortised to the income statement in line with the projected cash flows.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Prior to 1 May 2004, goodwill was amortised over its estimated useful life: such amortisation ceased on 30 April 2004 but goodwill amortisation expensed prior to 1 May 2004 was not reversed.
Goodwill that arose prior to 1 May 2004 is measured at the amount recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework, UK GAAP.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year ended 30 April 1998 and earlier periods was written off directly to equity in accordance with the UK accounting standards then in force.
Under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3, such goodwill remains eliminated against reserves.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future pre-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Any impairment of goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where goodwill other than that already written off directly to equity forms part of a cash generating unit and all or part of that unit is disposed of, the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the disposed operation when determining the overall gain or loss on disposal.
Impairment of non-current assets Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets excluding goodwill and other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future pre-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination are initially capitalised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
The initial cost recognised is the aggregate amount paid plus the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition if i the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and ii its fair value can be measured reliably, and are subsequently measured at fair value less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is calculated to write-off the cost or fair value at acquisition as the case may be of each asset over their estimated useful lives shown below.
Amortisation of intangible assets relating to customer contracts and lease contracts is amortised based on the pattern of the consumption of economic benefits obtained from the relevant contract.
Amortisation on other intangible assets is calculated on the straight-line method.
Intangible assets relating to rail franchises of a finite duration are amortised over the life of the franchise.
Operating leases on favourable terms over the life of the lease up to 4 years for current contracts Customer contracts operating leases on favourable terms over the life of the lease over the life of the contract 1 to 5 years for current contracts Right to operate rail franchises over the life of the franchise 10 years from February 2007 to February 2017 for South West Trains franchise and 7 years and 11 months from November 2007 to October 2015 for East Midlands Trains franchise Non-compete contracts between 2 and 5 years for current contracts Software costs 2 to 7 years Where the life of a contract or rail franchise is shortened or extended, the useful economic lives of any related intangible assets are reviewed, the intangible assets are reviewed for impairment and the remaining carrying value of each asset is amortised over its revised, remaining economic life.
New contracts and franchises are not treated as extensions of existing arrangements even when they cover the same business operations as expiring contracts and franchises.
Marketing costs incurred during the start-up phase of a new activity are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Stagecoach Group plc | page 71 108244 STC Back PRINT 108244 STC Back V12 03 07 2014 16:05 Page 72 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 1 IFRS accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment acquired as part of a business combination is stated at fair value at the date of acquisition and is subsequently measured at fair value on acquisition less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method to write off the cost, fair value at acquisition or deemed cost of each asset to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows: Heritable and freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 50 years Short leasehold properties period of lease IT and other equipment, furniture and fittings 3 to 10 years Passenger Service Vehicles PSVs and transportation equipment 7 to 16 years Motor cars and other vehicles 3 to 5 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
The useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at least annually and, where applicable, adjustments are made on a prospective basis.
An item of property, plant or equipment is derecognised upon disposal.
An item on which no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset is impaired if it is continued to be used by the Group.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds received with the carrying amount of the asset and are included in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement in the period of derecognition.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
The cost of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset will flow to the Group.
Major renovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO or average cost method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses.
Pre-contract costs The costs associated with securing new rail franchises are expensed as incurred, except when at the time the costs are incurred it is probable that a contract will be awarded, in which case they are recognised as an asset and are charged to the income statement over the life of the franchise.
Hire purchase and lease obligations Assets acquired under hire purchase and finance lease arrangements, where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Fixed lease payments are apportioned between the finance costs, and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance costs are charged directly against income and are reported within finance costs in the consolidated income statement.
Assets capitalised under finance leases and other similar contracts are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful economic lives.
Assets capitalised under hire purchase contracts are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Rentals under operating leases are generally charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
However, contingent rentals, principally being rental adjustments related to inflation indices, are accounted for in the period they are incurred.
The principal restriction on assets held under finance lease or hire purchase agreements is a restriction on the right to dispose of the assets during the period of the agreement.
Tokens Tokens issued by the Group to facilitate public passenger travel in the United Kingdom are credited to a token redemption provision to the extent they are expected to be redeemed by customers.
Redemptions are offset against this provision and associated handling commission paid to third parties is included in operating costs.
Funds from the sale of tokens and payments for the redemption of tokens are included as financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
The estimate of the balance sheet provision for token redemptions is remeasured at each balance sheet date and is based on the value of tokens issued by the Group but not yet redeemed or cancelled at the balance sheet date.
Allowance is made for the estimated proportion of tokens in issue that will never be redeemed.
This allowance is estimated with reference to historic redemption rates.
At 30 April 2014, it has been estimated that 97% 30 April 2013: 97% of tokens in issue will be redeemed.
Restructuring provisions Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and a reliable estimate of associated costs can be made.
Insurance The Group receives claims in respect of traffic incidents and employee claims.
The Group protects against the cost of such claims through third party insurance policies.
An element of the claims is not insured as a result of the excess or deductible on insurance policies.
Provision is made on a discounted basis for the estimated cost to the Group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
The estimate of the balance sheet insurance provisions is based on an assessment of the expected settlement of known claims together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but for which claims have not yet been reported to the Group.
The provision is set after taking account of advice from third party actuaries.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group contributes to a number of pension schemes.
In respect of defined benefit schemes, obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst scheme assets are recorded at market value.
In relation to each scheme, any recognised net asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from page 72 | Stagecoach Group plc 108244 STC Back PRINT 108244 STC Back V12 03 07 2014 16:05 Page 73 Note 1 IFRS accounting policies continued Retirement benefit obligations continued the scheme or reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the scheme or on settlement of the scheme liabilities.
The service costs of defined benefit schemes are spread systematically over the working lives of employees and included within operating profit.
Scheme administration expenses are also included within operating profit.
Net interest expense or income is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit asset or liability and included within net finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Actuarial gains and losses include the difference between the actual return on assets net of investment administration costs and taxes, such as amounts levied by the UK Pension Protection Fund and the discount rates applied to the assets.
Mortality rates are considered when retirement benefit obligations are calculated.
Past service costs and adjustments are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period the vesting period, in which case the past service costs are amortised using a straight-line method over the vesting period.
Curtailments arise where the Group makes a material reduction in the number of employees covered by a pension scheme or amends a defined benefit pension schemes terms such that a material element of future service by current employees will qualify for no or significantly reduced benefits.
Settlements arise when the Group enters into a transaction that eliminates all or part of the Groups obligations for benefits provided under a defined benefit pension scheme.
The gain or loss arising on a settlement or curtailment comprises the resulting change in the net pension asset or liability, and such gain or loss is recognised in the income statement when the settlement or curtailment occurs.
Where the gain or loss is related to a disposal of a business, it is included within the reported gain or loss on disposal.
A full actuarial valuation is undertaken triennially for each scheme and updated annually using independent actuaries following the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the scheme obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity equivalent to the terms of the related obligations.
Experience adjustments and changes in assumptions which affect actuarial gains and losses are reflected in the actuarial gain or loss for the year.
The liability or asset recognised for the relevant sections of the Railways Pension Scheme represents only that part of the net deficit or surplus of each section that the employer expects to fund or recover over the life of the franchise to which the section relates.
For defined contribution schemes, the Group pays contributions to separately administered pension schemes.
Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further payment obligations.
The Groups contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.
Financial instruments The disclosure of the accounting policies that follow for financial instruments are those that apply under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement.
Financial assets Financial assets are classified, as appropriate, as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: loans and receivables: held-to-maturity investments or as available for sale.
They include cash and cash equivalents, accrued income, trade receivables, other receivables, other investments and derivative financial instruments.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, normally being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as follows: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Financial assets classified as held for trading and other assets designated as such on inception are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss where the assets meet the criteria for such classification.
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short-term.
Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
Assets in this category are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables: Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either at fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Where the time value of money is material, receivables are discounted to the present value at the point they are first recognised and are subsequently amortised to the invoice amount by the payment due date.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered in evaluating whether a trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within Other external charges.
When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Held-to-maturity investments: The Group holds no held-to-maturity investments.
Available for sale financial assets: Available for sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the above categories.
These are included in non-current assets unless the Group intends to dispose of them within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
After initial recognition, available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value, with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the asset is derecognised or until the asset is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss reported in equity is included in the income statement.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered an indicator that the securities are impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the cumulative loss - measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss - is removed from equity and is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.

Financial liabilities include trade payables, accruals, other payables, borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement depends on its classification as follows: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Financial liabilities classified as held for trading and derivative liabilities that are not designated as hedging instruments are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Such liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses being recognised in the income statement.
Other: All other financial liabilities not classified as fair value through profit or loss are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Fair values The fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to appropriate market prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
These include using pricing models and discounted cash flow analysis.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: Fair value hedges, when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: Cash flow hedges, when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction: or Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity.
Net gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of all other derivatives, which are classified as held for trading, are taken to the income statement.
These may arise from derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied because they are either not designated or not effective as hedging instruments from an accounting perspective.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows: Fair value hedges: For fair value hedges, the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged: the derivative is remeasured at fair value and gains and losses from both the derivative and the hedged item are taken to the income statement.
The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
Cash flow hedges: For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts recorded in the statement of comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
For cash flow hedges of forecast fuel purchases, the transfer is to operating costs within the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recorded in the statement of comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the income statement.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement immediately.
Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity: For hedges of the net investment in a foreign entity, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the statement of comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts recorded in the statement of comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the foreign entity is sold.
Non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings, can be designated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign entity and are subject to the same requirements as derivative hedges of a net investment in a foreign entity.
Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with maturities at the balance sheet date of twelve months or less.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method subject to any adjustments in respect of fair value hedges.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings.
Interest on borrowings to purchase property, plant and equipment is expensed in the income statement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer or rollover settlement for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are generally not interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost which approximates to nominal value due to creditors days being relatively low.
Share capital and dividends Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company, its subsidiaries or employee share ownership trusts sponsored by the Company purchase ordinary shares in the Company, the consideration paid, including any attributable incremental external costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in equity.
Dividends on ordinary shares are recorded in the Groups financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Groups shareholders, or in the case of interim dividends, in the period in which they are paid.
page 74 | Stagecoach Group plc 108244 STC Back PRINT 108244 STC Back V12 03 07 2014 16:05 Page 75 Note 2 Segmental information Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors that are used to make strategic decisions.
The Group is managed, and reports internally, on a basis consistent with its four continuing operating segments, being UK Bus regional operations, UK Bus London, North America and UK Rail.
The Groups IFRS accounting policies are applied consistently, where appropriate, to each segment.
The segmental information provided in this note is on the basis of four operating segments as follows: Segment name Service operated Country of operation UK Bus regional operations Coach and bus operations United Kingdom and immaterial operations in mainland Europe UK Bus London Bus operations United Kingdom North America Coach and bus operations United States and Canada UK Rail Rail operations United Kingdom The Group has interests in three trading joint ventures: Virgin Rail Group that operates in UK Rail, Citylink that operates in UK Bus regional operations and Twin America LLC that operates in North America.
The results of these joint ventures are shown separately in notes 2 c and 2 g. a Revenue Due to the nature of the Groups business, the origin and destination of revenue i. e. United Kingdom or North America is the same in all cases except in respect of an immaterial amount of revenue for services operated by UK Bus regional operations between the UK and mainland Europe.
As the Group sells bus and rail services to individuals, it has few customers that are individually major.
Its major customers are typically public bodies that subsidise or procure transport services such customers include local authorities, transport authorities and the UK Department for Transport.

On adoption of IFRS, the Group took the exemption offered under IFRS 1 not to restate prior period business combinations.
Accordingly, the goodwill arising under UK GAAP on the acquisition of the 49% stake in Virgin Rail Group was carried over to IFRS.
However, Virgin Rail Groups only significant business is the operation of the West Coast Trains rail franchise.
The applicable long-term franchise ended on 8 December 2012 and the goodwill was written down to zero by the end of that franchise.
Whilst IFRS generally prohibits the amortisation of goodwill, the treatment adopted was a result of an anomaly on the first-time adoption of IFRS that would not arise if IFRS were applied to new acquisitions of businesses.

Gross deductible temporary differences of 30.1m 2013: 63.1m have not been recognised due to restrictions in the availability of their use.
Temporary differences in respect of the revaluation of land and buildings and in respect of rolled over capital gains are fully offset by temporary differences in respect of capital losses.
The reduction in the UK corporate income tax rate to 20% which takes effect from 1 April 2015 has been enacted by the balance sheet date.
The deferred tax balances have therefore been calculated by reference to the enacted UK corporation tax rate of 20% 2013: 23%.

Each cash generating unit is an operational division.
The UK Bus regional operations and UK Bus London cash generating units operate coach and bus operations in the United Kingdom.
The North America cash generating unit operates coach and bus operations in the US and Canada.
No goodwill has been allocated to the Groups UK rail operations.
The cash generating units are as follows: UK Bus UK Bus North America regional operations London 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m m m Carrying amount of goodwill 47.5 43.5 3.6 3.6 74.3 80.7 Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Period covered by approved management plans used in value in use calculation 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections 9.9% 9.3% 9.9% 9.3% 13.0% 11.8% Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond period of management plan 2.2% 2.2% 2.2% 2.2% 4.6% 4.6% Difference between above growth rate and long-term average growth rate for market in which unit operates Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil The calculation of value in use for each cash generating unit shown above is most sensitive to the assumptions on discount rates and growth rates and in the case of UK Bus London, the number of new contracts won and the terms of such contracts.
The assumptions used are considered to be consistent with past experience and external sources of information and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
The principal risks and uncertainties are set out in section 2.3.
The cost base of the UK Bus regional operations and North American operations can be flexed in response to changes in revenue and there is scope to reduce capital expenditure in the medium-term if other cash flows deteriorate.
Risks to the cash flow forecasts remain, however, and are described in section 2.3.
The cost base of UK Bus London is less flexible because the business is contractually committed to operate the majority of its services.
The discount rates have been determined with reference to the estimated post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC of the Group.
The WACC has been estimated as at 30 April 2014 at 7.9% 2013: 7.2% based on: The market capitalisation and net debt of the Group as at 30 April 2014 as an indication of the split between debt and equity: A risk-free rate of 2.7% 2013: 1.8% : A levered beta for the Group of 0.9 2013: 1.0 : A marginal pre-tax cost of debt of 5.2% 2013: 5.1%.
The pre-tax discount rate for each CGU has been determined by adjusting the Groups WACC for the risk profile and effects of tax on each of the relevant CGUs.
The Directors believe that in the case of each of the cash generating units shown above, any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount of the unit is based would not cause its carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited is the holding company of Virgin Rail Group Limited, which in turn is the holding company of West Coast Trains Limited.
The Virgin Rail Group Holdings shareholders agreement provides for joint decision making on key matters and equal representation on the Board.
As a consequence, the investment has been accounted for as a joint venture.
The Citylink shareholder agreement provides for joint and unanimous decision making on all key matters and therefore the investment has been accounted for as a joint venture.
In making this judgement, the Group noted that although it is responsible for the day to day management of Citylinks operations, key decisions are reserved for the joint venture partners.
In North America, Stagecoach has a joint venture, Twin America LLC, with CitySights.
Twin America LLC began operating on 31 March 2009.
In return for transferring certain assets to the joint venture, the Group holds 60% of the economic rights and 50% of the voting rights.
Twin America LLC has no share capital and is governed by a joint venture agreement, which provides for joint decision making on key matters.
Although the Managing Director of Twin America LLC is a representative of the other joint venture partner, the Group concluded Twin America LLC is a joint venture because key decisions are reserved for the two joint venture partners.
The Directors undertook an impairment review as at 30 April 2014 of the carrying value of the Groups joint venture interests and concluded that there had been no impairment loss.
Other than Twin America, there is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed the recoverable amounts.
Trading at Twin America has been challenging during the year ended 30 April 2014, as the New York sightseeing market has become increasingly competitive.
Downside sensitivities have been assessed and, although headroom exists between the 28.5m carrying value of the investment and its value in use, this headroom is much reduced.
As at 30 April 2014, the headroom in our base case is 8.6m.
This headroom would be eliminated with the investment at breakeven if the assumed revenue growth rate was lower by 40 basis points in each year of the 5-year forecast period, or if the discount rate were to increase by a further 160 basis points.

Stagecoach Group plc | page 93 108244 STC Back PRINT 108244 STC Back V12 03 07 2014 16:06 Page 94 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 25 Retirement benefits a Description of retirement benefit arrangements United Kingdom The Group participates in a number of defined benefit schemes in the UK as follows.
Date as at which last scheme valuation was prepared Stagecoach Pension schemes SPS comprising: The Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme: and 30 April 2011 The East London and Selkent Pension Scheme: 5 April 2013 The South West Trains section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : 30 December 2010 The Island Line section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : 30 December 2010 The East Midlands Trains section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : and 30 December 2010 A number of UK Local Government Pension Schemes LGPS.
31 March 2013 Both the Stagecoach Pension Scheme and the Local Government Pension Schemes are closed to new members from the Group.
All relevant sections of the Railways Pension Schemes are open to new members.
Unfunded benefits are provided to a small number of former employees with the net liabilities included within the unfunded balance reported in the tables that follow.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes covering UK employees, for which the Group has no further payment obligation once the contributions are paid other than lump-sum death in service benefits that are provided for certain UK employees.
For the defined benefit schemes, benefits are related to length of service and pensionable salary.
Pensionable salary for the Stagecoach Pension Schemes is subject to capped increases.
The weighted average duration as at 30 April 2014 of the expected benefit payments across all UK defined benefit schemes is estimated at 19.5 years 2013: 19.5 years.
The Directors believe that separate consideration should be given to RPS as the Group has no rights or obligations in respect of the relevant sections of the scheme following expiry of the related franchises.
In addition, under the terms of RPS, any fund deficit or surplus is shared by the employer 60% and the employees 40% in accordance with the shared cost nature of RPS.
The employees share of the deficit or surplus is reflected as an adjustment to RPS liabilities or assets.
Therefore the liability or asset recognised for the relevant sections of RPS reflects only that part of the net deficit or surplus of each section that the employer is expected to fund or expected to recover over the life of the franchise to which the section relates.
The adjusting entry referred to as the franchise adjustment represents that proportion of the deficit or surplus that is expected to exist at the end of the franchise and which the Group would not be obliged to fund or entitled to recover.
The Group is a participating employer in a number of UK Local Government Pension Schemes, and has limited influence over the operations of these schemes.
Active membership of these schemes is small and represents 2.4% 2013: 3.3% of the pensions charge in the consolidated income statement, but historic liabilities mean that these schemes represent around 11.5% 2013: 11.6% of the gross present value of pension obligations as at 30 April 2014 shown in the balance sheet.
The Group liaises with the administering authorities to seek to set contributions at appropriate levels to fund the benefits and deficit recovery payments over a reasonable period of time.
North America The Group participates in two small defined benefit schemes in North America, both of which are closed to new members.
The Group also operates defined contribution schemes which are open to eligible North American employees, for which the Group has no further payment obligation once the contributions are paid.
b Principal actuarial assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions used for the accounting disclosures for the schemes are shown below: 2014 2013 Discount rate 4.5% 4.4% Retail Prices inflation assumption 3.3% 3.2% Consumer Prices inflation assumption 2.3% 2.2% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries SPS 2.0% 2.0% Others 3.8% 3.7% Rate of increase of pensions in payment SPS 3.2% 3.1% Others 2.3% 2.2% Post-retirement mortality life expectancies in years Current pensioners at 65 male 19.2 19.1 Current pensioners at 65 female 23.5 23.4 Future pensioners at 65 aged 45 now male 21.3 21.2 Future pensioners at 65 aged 45 now female 25.3 25.2 The assumptions shown above are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not be borne out in practice.
The discount rate assumption is not determined using a cash-weighted method and is based on market yields on high quality corporate bonds at the year end, adjusted to reflect the duration of the schemes liabilities.
The assumptions used to determine end-of-year benefit obligations are also used to calculate the following years cost.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the Group and its sector and allow for expected increases in longevity.
page 94 | Stagecoach Group plc 108244 STC Back PRINT 108244 STC Back V12 03 07 2014 16:06 Page 95 Note 25 Retirement benefits continued c Pension amounts recognised in the balance sheet The consolidated balance sheet shows retirement benefit assets of 7.8m 2013 restated: 15.6m and retirement benefit obligations of 123.6m 2013 restated: 125.2m, resulting in the net liability of 115.8m 2013 restated: 109.6m analysed below.
This fund is a multi-asset fund, tactically adjusted by the RPS Investment team.
The Group makes contributions to an unapproved employer-financed retirement benefit scheme EFRBS in the UK and a non qualifying defined contribution scheme NQDC in the US.
In each case, the liabilities of these schemes are unfunded but the Group has set aside assets to meet its obligations under the schemes.
In the case of the EFRBS, the scheme holds a guarantee over the assets which the Group has set aside.
The Group considers that the assets set aside are in substance pensions assets and so the amounts of those assets are included within the net pension amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet.
The carrying value of those assets as at 30 April 2014 was 3.9m 2013: 3.1m.
d Funding arrangements and plans The schemes investment approach, which aims to meet their liabilities as they fall due, is to invest the majority of the schemes assets in a mix of equities and other return-seeking assets in order to strike a balance between: maximising the returns on the schemes assets, and minimising the risks associated with lower than expected returns on the schemes assets.
Trustees are required to regularly review investment strategy in light of the revised term and nature of the schemes liabilities.
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees of the Stagecoach Pension Schemes and the Group to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the contributions necessary to fund the benefits including any deficit recovery amounts over a reasonable period of time.
A Pensions Oversight Committee has been established comprising the Finance Director, a Non-Executive Director and other senior executives, to oversee the Groups overall pensions strategy.
The Board participates in major decisions on the funding and design of pension schemes.
There is a risk to the Group that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Group to make additional contributions to fund deficits.
The defined benefit pension schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial funding risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, and longevity life expectancy risk.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method.
The actuarial valuation for the East London and Selkent Pension Scheme was completed during the year, and showed that as at 5 April 2013, the scheme was 100% funded on the Trustees technical provisions basis.
Actuarial valuations were completed for the Local Government Pension Schemes, showing that the schemes were underfunded on the technical provisions basis as at 31 March 2013 with deficit contributions payable.
Actuarial valuations for the Railways Pensions Scheme and the Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme are currently being undertaken and will be finalised during the year to 30 April 2015.
The Group expects to contribute 59.1m estimated at 30 April 2013 for year ended 30 April 2014: 54.0m to its defined benefit schemes in the financial year ending 30 April 2015.

A 10 basis points increase in the discount rate would result in a 20.0m decrease in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2014 2013: 22.0m.
A 10 basis points decrease in the discount rate would result in a 20.4m increase in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2014 2013: 22.5m.
The inflation assumption adopted is consistent with the discount rate used.
It is used to set the assumptions for pension increases, uncapped pensionable salary increases and deferred revaluations.
A 10 basis points increase in the inflation rate would result in a 12.7m increase in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2014 2013: 14.2m.
A 10 basis points decrease in the inflation rate would result in a 14.0m decrease in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2014 2013: 13.1m.
A 10 basis point increase in the rate of increase in uncapped pensionable salaries would result in a 0.6m increase in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2014 2013: 0.5m.
A 10 basis point decrease in the rate of increase in uncapped pensionable salaries would result in a 0.6m decrease in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2014 2013: 0.5m.
A 10 basis point increase in the rate of increase of pensions in payment would result in a 11.6m increase in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2014 2013: 10.2m.
A 10 basis point decrease in the rate of increase of pensions in payment would result in a 10.7m decrease in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2014 2013: 10.3m.
The longevity assumptions adopted are a best estimate of the mortality of scheme members both during and after employment, and are based on the most recent mortality data available from actuarial valuations.
If life expectancy of the relevant individuals was to increase by one year, this would result in an increase of 41.6m in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2014 2013: 43.7m.
If life expectancy of the relevant individuals was to decrease by one year, this would result in a decrease of 43.8m in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2014 2013: 43.6m.
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the net liability in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
In practice, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the invested assets held by the schemes.

Retirement benefit assets and obligations.
Financial instruments, contracts and obligations under share based payment transactions.
Liabilities or assets that are not contractual such as income taxes that are created as a result of statutory requirements imposed by governments, prepayments, provisions and deferred income are not financial liabilities or financial assets.
Accordingly, prepayments, provisions, deferred income and amounts payable or receivable in respect of corporation tax, sales tax including UK Value Added Tax, payroll tax and other taxes are excluded from the disclosures provided in this note.

Information on the carrying value of such derivatives is provided in note 26 g. The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities shown above are determined as follows: The carrying value of accrued income, trade receivables and other receivables is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Given the short average time to maturity, no specific assumptions on discount rates have been made.
The effect of credit losses not already reflected in the carrying value as impairment losses is assumed to be immaterial.
0.3m 2013: 0.3m of available for sale financial assets for which market prices are not available are measured at cost because their fair value cannot be measured reliably the fair value of these assets is shown in the above table as being equal to their carrying value.
The carrying value of trade payables, other payables, accruals and loans from joint ventures is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Given the relatively short average time to maturity, no specific assumptions on discount rates have been made.
The fair value of fixed-rate notes included in borrowings that are quoted on a recognised stock exchange is determined with reference to the bid price as at the balance sheet date.

The fair value of other borrowings on which interest is payable at floating rates is not considered to be materially different from the carrying value.
We do not consider that the fair value of financial instruments would change materially from that shown above as a result of any reasonable change to the assumptions made in determining the fair values shown above.
The fair value of financial instruments, and in particular the fixed rate notes, would be affected by changes in market interest rates.
Excluding the element hedged in a fair value hedge, we estimate that a 100 basis points reduction in market interest rates would increase the fair value of the fixed-rate notes liability by around 15.8m 2013: 20.3m.
Fair value estimation Financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value are disclosed by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 0 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 1 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices.
Level 2 Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The following table presents the Groups financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value within the hierarchy at 30 April 2014.

The Group does not intend to dispose of these assets in the foreseeable future.
These assets are measured at cost because their fair value cannot be measured reliably.
The value of the assets is not material to the Group and therefore changes in valuations would not have a material effect on the financial statements.
c Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments The Groups use of financial instruments exposes it to a variety of financial risks, principally: Market risk including currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk: Credit risk: and Liquidity risk.
This note c presents qualitative information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, including the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk: there have been no significant changes to these matters during the year ended 30 April 2014.
This note c also provides summary quantitative data about the Groups exposure to each risk.
In addition, information on the Groups management of capital is provided in section 2.6.
12 of the Strategic report which forms part of these financial statements.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the likelihood and or magnitude of adverse effects on the financial performance and financial position of the Group.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not generally hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
A Group Treasury Committee and central treasury department Group Treasury oversee financial risk management in the context of policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in co-operation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury is responsible for the execution of derivative financial instruments to manage financial risks.
Certain financial risk management activities for example, the management of credit risk arising from trade and other receivables are devolved to the management of individual business units.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investing excess liquidity.

The objective of the Groups management of market risk is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to reduce volatility in the consolidated income statement.
Foreign currency translation risk Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument including foreign net investments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk principally as a result of net investments in foreign operations and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group has material foreign investments in Canada and the USA.
To reduce balance sheet translation exposure, the Group partially hedges the sterling carrying value of foreign operations through borrowings denominated in their functional currency or, where appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Gains and losses arising from hedging instruments that provide a hedge against foreign net investments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Bank loans drawn in US Dollars and a US$150.0m bond issued in October 2012 have been accounted for as a hedge of the Groups foreign net investments.
The Groups objective in managing and measuring foreign currency translation risk associated with net investments in foreign operations and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies is to maintain an appropriate cost of borrowing and retain some potential for benefiting from currency movements whilst partially hedging against adverse currency movements.
It is the Groups policy to examine each foreign investment individually and to adopt an appropriate hedging strategy.
The Group measures foreign currency translation risk by identifying the carrying value of assets and liabilities denominated in the relevant foreign currency and quantifying the impact on equity of changes in the relevant foreign currency rate.
The Groups consolidated income statement is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates in the following ways: The translation of the revenues and costs of the Groups North American operations: and The translation of interest payable on US dollar denominated debt.
The Groups consolidated balance sheet exposures to foreign currency translation risk were as follows: 2014 2013 m m US dollars Net investments in foreign operations excluding intra-group balances, cash and borrowings 230.7 272.6 Cash 24.5 21.4 Borrowings 174.0 202.6 Canadian dollars Net investments in foreign operations excluding intra-group balances, cash and borrowings 37.0 47.6 Cash 0.7 1.2 Net exposure 118.9 140.2 The amounts shown above are the carrying values of all items in the consolidated balance sheet that would have differed at the balance sheet date had a different foreign currency exchange rate been applied, except that commodity derivatives that are cash flow hedges are excluded.
The sensitivity of the amounts shown above in the Groups consolidated balance sheet to translation exposures is illustrated below: 2014 2013 US dollar US dollar balance sheet foreign exchange rate 1.6886 1.5564 Impact of 10% depreciation of UK sterling against US dollar US dollar foreign exchange rate 1.5197 1.4008 Increase in consolidated equity m 9.0 10.2 Impact of 10% appreciation of UK sterling against US dollar US dollar foreign exchange rate 1.8575 1.7120 Decrease in consolidated equity m 7.4 8.3 Canadian dollar Canadian dollar balance sheet foreign exchange rate 1.8531 1.5655 Impact of 10% depreciation of UK sterling against Canadian dollar Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate 1.6678 1.4090 Increase in consolidated equity m 4.2 5.4 Impact of 10% appreciation of UK sterling against Canadian dollar Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate 2.0384 1.7221 Decrease in consolidated equity m 3.4 4.4 The above sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: Only those foreign currency assets and liabilities that are directly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates are included in the calculation.
The above calculations assume that the exchange rates between sterling and any currencies other than the one stated do not change as a result of the change in the exchange rate between the currencies stated.

For example, changes in commodity prices that indirectly occur due to changes in foreign exchange rates are not included in the sensitivity calculation.

The Group is exposed to limited foreign currency transactional risk due to the low value of transactions entered into by subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency.
Group Treasury carries out forward buying of currencies where appropriate.
The Group reviews and considers hedging of actual and forecast foreign exchange transactional exposures up to one year forward.
At 30 April 2014 there were no material net transactional foreign currency exposures 2013: Nil.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk includes a foreign currency element due to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the sterling cost of fuel for the Groups UK operations.
The effect of foreign exchange rate movements on sterling-denominated fuel prices is managed through the use of fuel derivative financial instruments denominated in the functional currency in which the fuel is purchased.
Further information on fuel hedging is given under the heading Price risk on page 104.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk principally through its borrowings and interest rate derivatives.
It has a mixture of fixed-rate borrowings where the fair value is exposed to changes in market interest rates, cash and floating-rate borrowings where the future cash flows are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
The Groups objective with regards to interest rate risk is to reduce the risk of changes in interest rates significantly affecting future cash flows and or profit.
To provide some certainty as to the level of interest cost, it is the Groups policy to manage interest rate exposure through the use of fixed and floating rate debt.
Derivative financial instruments are also used where appropriate to generate the desired interest rate profile.
The Group measures interest rate risk by quantifying the relative proportions of each of gross debt and net debt that are effectively subject to fixed interest rates and considers the duration for which the relevant interest rates are fixed.
At 30 April 2014, the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial liabilities was as follows: Currency Floating rate Fixed rate Total Weighted Weighted average fixed average period interest rate for which rate is fixed m m m % Years Sterling 122.8 414.3 537.1 5.8% 2.6 US Dollar 135.8 38.2 174.0 2.6% 2.6 Gross borrowings 258.6 452.5 711.1 5.5% 2.6 At 30 April 2013, the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial liabilities was as follows: Currency Floating rate Fixed rate Total Weighted Weighted average fixed average period interest rate for which rate is fixed m m m % Years Sterling 193.0 416.0 609.0 5.8% 3.6 US Dollar 147.9 54.7 202.6 3.0% 2.8 Gross borrowings 340.9 470.7 811.6 5.4% 3.5 The above figures take into account the effect of US$150m of interest rate derivatives which swap the US$150m Notes maturing October 2022 from fixed to floating rate debt for a period of four years to December 2016.
The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods ranging from one to six months based on market rates.
The maturity profile of the Groups borrowings is shown in note 22 a.
The Groups financial assets on which floating interest is receivable comprise cash deposits and cash in hand of 240.3m 2013: 262.2m.
As at 30 April 2014 the Group has no financial assets on which fixed interest is receivable 2013: Nil.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

Price risk The Group is exposed to commodity price risk.
The Groups operations as at 30 April 2014 consume approximately 399.5m litres of diesel fuel per annum.
As a result, the Groups profit is exposed to movements in the underlying price of fuel.
The Groups objective in managing commodity price risk is to reduce the risk that movements in fuel prices result in adverse movements in its profit and cash flow.
The Group has a policy of managing the volatility in its fuel costs by maintaining an ongoing fuel-hedging programme whereby derivatives are used to fix or cap the variable unit cost of a percentage of anticipated fuel consumption.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk is measured by quantifying the element of projected future fuel costs, after taking account of derivatives in place, which varies due to movements in fuel prices.
Group Treasury is responsible for the processes for measuring and managing commodity price risk.
The Groups overall fuel costs include the impact of delivery margins, fuel taxes and fuel tax rebates.
These elements of fuel costs are not managed as part of Group Treasurys commodity price risk management and are managed directly by business unit management.
The Group uses a number of fuel derivatives to hedge against movements in the price of the different types of fuel used in each of its divisions.
The fuel derivatives hedge the underlying commodity price risk denominated in US$ and in the case of the UK Bus regional operations division, the UK Bus London division and the UK Rail division, they also hedge the currency risk due to the commodity being priced in US$ and the functional currency of the divisions being pounds sterling.
At 30 April 2014 and 30 April 2013, the projected fuel costs excluding premia payable on fuel derivatives, delivery margins, fuel taxes and fuel tax rebates for the next twelve months were: 2014 2013 m m Costs subject to fuel swaps: UK Bus regional operations 90.7 91.6 UK Bus London 9.5 9.3 UK Rail 24.6 25.8 North America 34.8 37.2 159.6 163.9 Costs not subject to fuel swaps: UK Bus regional operations 5.5 3.1 UK Bus London 8.9 9.2 UK Rail 9.0 7.5 North America 8.2 11.8 31.6 31.6 Total 191.2 195.5 The figures in the above table are after taking account of derivatives and applying the fuel prices and foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date.
If all of the relevant fuel prices were 10% higher at the balance sheet date, the amounts in the above table would change by the following: 2014 2013 m m Costs not subject to fuel swaps: UK Bus regional operations 0.6 0.3 UK Bus London 0.9 0.9 UK Rail 0.9 0.8 North America 0.8 1.2 Decrease in projected profit before taxation 3.2 3.2 page 104 | Stagecoach Group plc 108244 STC Back PRINT 108244 STC Back V12 03 07 2014 16:06 Page 105 Note 26 Financial instruments continued c Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued i Market risk continued If all of the relevant fuel prices were 10% lower at the balance sheet date, the amounts would change by the following: 2014 2013 m m Costs not subject to fuel swaps: UK Bus regional operations 0.6 0.3 UK Bus London 0.9 0.9 UK Rail 0.9 0.8 North America 0.8 1.2 Increase in projected profit before taxation 3.2 3.2 The revenue receivable under certain of the contracts that the Group has with customers is subject to adjustment for changes to certain fuel prices.
This further reduces the unhedged exposure to fuel prices shown above.
The Group is also exposed to changes in electricity prices, principally in its UK Rail Division where electricity is consumed to power some of the trains operated.
The Group has some protection to price changes via rail industry arrangements to fix the price on a proportion of anticipated future electricity consumption.
The Groups joint venture, Virgin Rail Group, is also exposed to changes in fuel and electricity prices and applies commodity price risk management strategies similar to those applied by the Group and explained above.
ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk is managed by a combination of Group Treasury and business unit management, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to amounts due from outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Groups objective is to minimise credit risk to an acceptable level whilst not overly restricting the Groups ability to generate revenue and profit.
It is the Groups policy to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
To control credit risk, counterparty credit limits are set by reference to published credit ratings and the counterpartys geographical location.
The Group considers the risk of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be low.
In determining whether a financial asset is impaired, the Group takes account of: The fair value of the asset at the balance sheet date and where applicable, the historic fair value of the asset: In the case of receivables, the counterpartys typical payment patterns: In the case of receivables, the latest available information on the counterpartys creditworthiness such as available financial statements, credit ratings etc.
In the case of equity investments classified as available for sale assets, a significant or prolonged reduction in the fair value of the assets is considered as an indicator that the securities might be impaired.
The movement in the provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is shown in note 19.
The table below shows the financial assets exposed to credit risk at the balance sheet date: Gross Impairment Net exposure Gross Impairment Net exposure 2014 2014 2014 2013 2013 2013 m m m m m m Trade receivables 132.6 2.1 130.5 123.7 1.9 121.8 Loans, other receivables and accrued income 82.9 82.9 65.5 65.5 Cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral 18.9 18.9 19.2 19.2 Cash and cash equivalents other 221.4 221.4 243.0 243.0 Excluding derivative financial instruments 455.8 2.1 453.7 451.4 1.9 449.5 Derivatives used for hedging 0.6 0.6 2.6 2.6 Total exposure to credit risk 456.4 2.1 454.3 454.0 1.9 452.1 The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer or counterparty.
The Groups largest credit exposures are to the UKs Department for Transport, Transport for London, and other government bodies and financial institutions with short-term credit ratings of A2 or equivalent or better, all of which the Group considers unlikely to default on their respective liabilities to the Group.

iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups objective in managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The funding policy is to finance the Group through a mixture of bank, lease and hire purchase debt, capital markets issues and cash generated by the business.
As at 30 April 2014, the Groups credit facilities were 1,051.4m 2013: 1,098.9m, 483.4m 2013: 540.8m of which were utilised, including utilisation for the issuance of bank guarantees, bonds and letters of credit.
The Group had the following undrawn committed banking and uncommitted asset finance facilities: 2014 2013 m m Expiring within one year 202.6 229.3 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 355.8 Expiring beyond two years 9.5 328.8 567.9 558.1 Although there is an element of seasonality in the Groups bus and rail operations, the overall impact of seasonality on working capital and liquidity is not considered significant.
The Board expects the Group to be able to meet current and future funding requirements through free cash flow and available committed facilities.
In addition, the Group has investment grade credit ratings which should allow it access at short notice to additional bank and capital markets debt funding.
The Groups principal lines of credit have been arranged on a bi-lateral basis with a group of relationship banks which provide bank facilities for general corporate purposes.
These arranged lines of credit allow cash drawdowns to finance the Group and also include facilities which are dedicated to issuing performance season ticket bonds, guarantees and letters of credit.
The Groups committed bank facilities as at 30 April 2014 are analysed below: Performance bonds, Available for Available for Loans guarantees non-cash cash Facility drawn etc drawn utilisation only drawings Expiring in m m m m m MAIN GROUP FACILITIES 2018 47.4 37.9 9.5 2016 546.8 82.4 110.3 25.1 329.0 2015 110.5 88.9 21.6 704.7 82.4 237.1 56.2 329.0 LOCAL & SHORT-TERM FACILITIES Various 21.8 8.7 13.1 726.5 82.4 245.8 56.2 342.1 page 106 | Stagecoach Group plc 108244 STC Back PRINT 108244 STC Back V12 03 07 2014 16:06 Page 107 Note 26 Financial instruments continued c Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued iii Liquidity risk continued The Group manages its liquidity risk based on contracted cash flows.

Where the contractual cash flows are variable based on a price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index in the future, the contractual cash flows in the above table have been determined with reference to the relevant price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index as at the balance sheet date.
In determining the interest element of contractual cash flows in cases where the Group has a choice as to the length of interest calculation periods and the interest rate that applies varies with the period selected, the contractual cash flows have been calculated assuming the Group selects the shortest available interest calculation periods.
Where the holder of an instrument has a choice of when to redeem, the amounts in the above tables are on the assumption the holder redeems at the earliest opportunity.
In the case of bank loans, which are drawn under revolving facilities, the contracted cash flows in respect of interest up to and including the next rollover date are shown.

This figure includes 724,693 2013: nil ordinary shares held in treasury, which are treated as a deduction from equity in the Groups financial statements.
The shares held in treasury do not qualify for dividends.
The Group operates two Employee Share Ownership Trusts: the Stagecoach Group Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST and the Stagecoach Group Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
Shares held by these trusts are treated as a deduction from equity in the Groups financial statements.
Other assets and liabilities of the trusts are consolidated in the Groups financial statements as if they were assets and liabilities of the Group.
As at 30 April 2014, the QUEST held 300,634 2013: 300,634 ordinary shares in the Company and the EBT held 725,821 2013: 2,030,824 ordinary shares in the Company.
The trusts have waived dividends on the shares they hold and therefore received no dividends during the year ended 30 April 2014 2013: Nil.
The trust deed for the EBT obliges the trustee to waive the right to any dividend on the shares unless and until they are vested in an individual.
The trustee is confirmed not to be liable for any lost income as a result of that waiver.
The QUEST deed requires the trustee to waive any dividends payable on the shares and the QUEST confirms that waiver within the deed.
This can be reversed by a direction from the Company to the trustee but is otherwise ongoing.
Note 28 Share based payments The Group operates a Buy as You Earn Scheme BAYE, a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and an Executive Participation Plan EPP.
The Directors remuneration report in section 9 of this Annual Report gives further details of each of these arrangements.

The balance of the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares offset by issue costs, bonus issues of shares and any transfer between reserves.
The balance held in the retained earnings reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the Group.
Cumulative goodwill of 113.8m 2013: 113.8m has been written off against reserves in periods prior to 1 May 1998 in accordance with the UK accounting standards then in force and such goodwill will remain eliminated against reserves.
The capital redemption reserve represents the cumulative par value of all shares bought back and cancelled.
Details of own shares held are given in note 27.
The own shares reserve represents the cumulative cost of shares in Stagecoach Group plc purchased in the market and held in treasury and or by the Groups two Employee Share Ownership Trusts offset by cumulative sales proceeds.
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translations of the financial statements of foreign operations.
It is also used to record the effect of hedging net investments in foreign operations.

d Non cash transactions The principal non cash transactions were the acquisition of property, plant and equipment using new hire purchase and finance leases.
During the year, the Group entered into hire purchase and finance lease arrangements in respect of new assets with a total capital value at inception of the contracts of 6.7m 2013: 29.1m.
After taking account of deposits paid up front and other financing transactions, new hire purchase and finance lease liabilities of 6.7m 2013: 26.8m were recognised.
Note 31 Contingencies Contingent liabilities i At 30 April 2014, the following bonds and guarantees were in place relating to the Groups rail operations: 2014 2013 m m Performance bonds backed by bank facilities and or insurance arrangements Stagecoach South Western Trains 35.7 34.7 East Midlands Trains 28.8 17.6 Season ticket bonds backed by bank facilities and or insurance arrangements Stagecoach South Western Trains 54.2 51.2 East Midlands Trains 5.9 5.7 These contingent liabilities are not expected to crystallise.
ii The Group and its joint venture, Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited, have, in the normal course of business, entered into a number of long-term supply contracts.
The most significant of these relate to track, station and depot access facilities, together with new train lease and maintenance arrangements.
iii Under UK Rail franchise agreements, the Group and its joint venture, Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited, have agreed with the DfT annual amounts receivable or payable in respect of the operation of rail franchises for future periods.
Under these agreements, there is a requirement to comply with a number of obligations.
Failure to comply with these obligations would be a breach of the relevant franchise.
The Group assessed whether a provision for onerous contracts is required in respect of its rail franchises.
The Group has discounted the expected future cash flows related to its rail franchises to determine whether it is probable that the benefits to be derived by the Group from the franchises will be lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the franchises.
Estimates of cash flows are consistent with managements plans and forecasts.
The Group has determined that no provision is necessary.
The estimation of future cash flows and the discount rate involves a significant degree of judgment.
Actual results can differ from those assumed and there can be no absolute assurance that the assumptions used will hold true.
Under certain circumstances following a breach by the Group of one or more of its rail franchise agreements, the DfT has the right to terminate all of the franchises operated by the Group.
Where the Group has defaulted on one franchise, the DfT has cross-default rights that might enable it but not require it to terminate all of the franchises.
The financial effect on the Group of a termination of one or more franchises would depend on which, if any, of the Groups contingent liabilities that the DfT sought to call.
As at 30 April 2014, the capital at risk of the Group in this respect was: page 114 | Stagecoach Group plc 108244 STC Back PRINT 108244 STC Back V12 03 07 2014 16:06 Page 115 Note 31 Contingencies continued South Western East Midlands Trains Trains Total m m m Actual liabilities Net intra-group amounts payable to train operators 59.8 59.8 Contingent liabilities Season ticket bonds 54.2 5.9 60.1 Performance bonds 35.7 28.8 64.5 Parent company guarantees to suppliers 10.6 10.6 Undrawn committed loan facilities 25.0 20.0 45.0 Capital at risk as at 30 April 2014 174.7 65.3 240.0 Cash Cash in train operating companies 103.3 67.5 170.8 Pro forma impact on net debt 278.0 132.8 410.8 We consider the likelihood of the contingent liabilities crystallising as being low.
However, if all of the contingent liabilities had crystallised at 30 April 2014, the Group would have needed to have financed 240.0m 2013: 221.1m and its gross debt would have increased by this amount.
In addition, some of the cash in the train operating companies would be transferred with the franchises.
There is no recourse to the Group in respect of any liabilities or contingent liabilities of Virgin Rail Group.
iv We have made progress in resolving the previously reported litigation regarding Twin America.
"The US Department of Justice and the New York Attorney General together, ""the Government plaintiffs"" initiated litigation against Twin America and its joint venture partners ""the Defendants"", which include two Stagecoach US subsidiaries in 2012."
The litigation alleges that the formation of the Twin America joint venture in 2009 was anti-competitive.
Separately, private plaintiffs brought a claim based on the same allegations on behalf of a proposed class of customers.
The Defendants have not admitted any liability but have agreed a cash settlement of US$19m 11.9m with the private plaintiffs to fully resolve the private litigation.
That settlement has received preliminary court approval.
Final court approval is anticipated in approximately six to nine months following a period for class notification and claims administration.
The Government action remains pending at this time.
Until the Government action concludes, the total financial cost of the various actions cannot be determined.
The Group has recorded exceptional pre-tax costs of US$14.8m 9.2m in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2014 in respect of its share of financial costs connected with the litigation.
The ultimate cost to the Group may differ from this as it remains dependent on the outcome of the Government action.
v The Group and the Company are from time to time party to other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.
Liabilities have been recognised in the financial statements for the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle obligations arising under such legal actions.
As at 30 April 2014, the accruals in the consolidated financial statements for such claims total 0.1m 2013: 1.9m in addition to the amounts recognised specifically in respect of the Twin America litigation noted in iv above.
In addition, certain of the claims intended to be covered by the insurance provisions see note 24 are subject to or might become subject to litigation against the Group and or the Company.
