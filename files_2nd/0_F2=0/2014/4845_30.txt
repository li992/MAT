C12 Post-retirement benefits The Company maintains a pension scheme for eligible employees in the UK comprising both a defined benefit and defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants and on 30 April 2010 was closed to future accrual with automatic entry into the defined contribution section being offered to those active members of the defined benefit section at that time.
Membership of the defined contribution section is offered to all eligible employees.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was last carried out as at 31 March 2010 and showed a shortfall of assets compared with liabilities of 239.0 million.
A recovery plan based on this valuation has been agreed with the trustee and commenced in 2010 11 with special contributions of 12.0 million, rising to 20.0 million for 2012 13 and 2013 14.
Contributions rise to 25.0 million for 2014 15 and will rise approximately annually thereafter to 35.0 million by 2020 21.
The next triennial valuation as at 31 March 2013 has commenced and its results are expected within the first half of 2014 15.
At 31 March 2010, the market value of the schemes investments was 672.0 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 74% of the benefits accrued to members with the liabilities amounting to 911.0 million.
The valuation of the defined benefit section for the purposes of IAS 19 showed a gross pension deficit before deferred tax of 399.8 million 2013 406.4 million and 2012 261.9 million.
Further particulars of the scheme are disclosed in note 21 to the Group Financial Statements.

The categories of financial assets and liabilities and their related accounting policy are set out in notes 1.11 and 1.15 to the Group Financial Statements.

See note C13 c for further details.

c Hedging activities The Company has previously managed exposures that arise on interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps.
Further information on fair value hedging is set out in note 22 c to the Group Financial Statements.
d Interest rate profile of financial assets and financial liabilities by currency The following table sets out the interest rate exposure of the financial assets and liabilities of the Company: 2014 2013 2012 Sterling Sterling Sterling million million million Cash and cash equivalents: Floating rate 102.2 28.4 72.9 Fixed rate 37.2 133.0 139.4 161.4 72.9 Borrowings: Floating rate 85.4 86.5 336.1 Fixed rate 246.9 245.4 60.0 332.3 331.9 396.1 Net debt 192.9 170.5 323.2 Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Floating rate cash and cash equivalents relate to money market deposits as shown in note C6.
Fixed rate borrowings comprise the 2015 Notes and the 2017 Notes 2012 and 2011 the unhedged part of the 2012 Bonds and the 2015 Notes.
Floating rate borrowings include bank overdrafts, fixed rate bonds notes after taking into account the effect of interest rates swaps entered into by the Company and drawings under the Amended Facility 2012 and 2011 the 360 million Facility.
The weighted average effective interest rate on bank overdrafts approximated 1.5% 2012 13 1.5%.
Further details on fixed and floating rate borrowings are shown in notes 17 and 22 to the Group Financial Statements.
e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and total equity to changes in interest rates on derivative financial instruments and certain monetary items.
The sensitivity analysis reflects the position as at 30 April 2014 and 30 April 2013, respectively, and is not necessarily representative of actual or future outcomes.
Changes in interest rates affect the Companys loss before tax, mainly due to the impact of floating rate borrowings, cash and derivative financial instruments.
The Companys principal floating rate interest rate exposures are based on LIBOR.
The following sensitivity analysis shows a reasonably possible change in interest rates uniform across all currencies, with other variables held constant and the corresponding decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
A 1% increase in interest rates would have a negative effect on profit before tax and equity of 2.0 million 2012 13 a 3.2 million negative effect on profit before tax and equity.
Assumptions used in calculating the sensitivity analysis are set out in note 22 e to the Group Financial Statements.
