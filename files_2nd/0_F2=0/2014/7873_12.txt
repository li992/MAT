16 IMI plc Strategy in action 2.
Improving operational performance The benefits of moving towards and achieving best in class operational performance are very significant.
As we improve how our businesses operate we will better utilise capacity, enhance our competitiveness, reduce working capital and generate cost savings by operating more efficiently.
By doing this, we will also improve services for our customers.
Our ambition is to progressively self-fund our organic growth initiatives using the benefits generated from our operational improvements.
We are on a self-help lean journey, underpinned by the engagement of management and employees at all levels as we believe this is the best way to sustain our achievements.
The operational performance of every site in the Group is now being benchmarked every six months against the ten areas of lean and significant progress has already been achieved.
A worldclass operational performance score is 85% or more and at the time of the first benchmark, none of our facilities came close to achieving this, with the highest score being 57%.
Each of our businesses now have detailed plans in place to achieve world-class performance by 2018.

Benchmarking identifies Control Work best practice within IMI and provides visibility of where to focus improvements and where to go for assistance to improve performance going forward.
