CGUs are defined as geographical territories, because they represent the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates the discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money.
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
132 | HomeServe Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic report Corporate responsibility Governance Financial statements The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans for the next three years approved by the Directors and extrapolates the annual cash flow using estimated, country specific, long-term growth rates.
The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast pre-tax cash flows are different for each territory and are detailed: UK 10.8% 2013: 12.1% USA 14.5% 2013: 15.4% France 12.2% 2013: 13.8% Spain 13.2% 2013: 13.2% The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value, which also reflects the different risk profile of each CGU.
The Group believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.
This view is based upon inherently judgmental assumptions, however, it takes account of the headroom in the value in use calculation versus the current carrying value.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2014 2013 m m UK 154.7 154.6 USA 4.0 4.4 France 74.5 76.1 Spain 13.1 13.3 246.3 248.4 In the prior year, an impairment charge of 14.8m was recognised in respect of Socit Franaise fide Garantie S. A. which was disposed of on 5 March 2014.
